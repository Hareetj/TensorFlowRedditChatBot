Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. If you can't donate blood, think about donating food and drinks. 
Thank you for this. My sister is a critical care nurse at ormc and she lives only a few miles from Pulse. The day they worked today was long and the days to come will be too. My sister just wants everyone to know that ormc is a level one trauma center for a reason, and they were prepared for handling tragedy like this, and she is glad for it. Hearing from her about surgeries in hallways gave me chills. I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking of them. Also tijuana flats gave them all dinner so they've got that going for them, which is nice.
That must have been incredibly tragic. I hope you're doing well. 
I'm so sorry please let us know when you hear something 
Correct, I believe he will speak at 1:30 eastern time. 
Yes! Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. Random acts of pizza is an amazing thing to do right now if you can't donate blood. 
Donation centers are at capacity for the day, but they're asking everyone to donate as the week goes on. 
I'm glad your brother is okay. 
I live right down the street from the club myself, absolutely crazy, I'm glad your friend is safe.
It's now officially the worst shooting in US history. :(
An off-duty officer was working in the club, exchanged gunfire with the suspect when he began shooting on the main floor at approx 2 AM. Two additional officers responded, initiating the hostage-taking and subsequent standoff. 
you made perfect sense, thank you.
The shooter's father has apparently said that he had become angry after seeing two guys kiss in Miami.  So yeah, seems like he hates gays and this was a hate killing.  
He was a U.S born citizen wasn't he?
If he is actually a member of ISIS, then the bastard gets what he wants. The greater the divide between ordinary Muslims and the West, the better for ISIS.If he is just some moronic idiot who hated gays, then yes he is just some incompetent evil idiot.
Honestly, 60% of the comments are about /r/news. Let's get more discussions about the actual situation.
Pride month has always been a bleak reminder (Stonewall), but I do agree, so many years later to have this time punctuated by this event is heartbreaking.   
Probably is. How many times has he had to make the same speech during his presidency? Gotta get disheartening 
While your statement is correct, this is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S., ever.
On r/news? Mos def.
Facebook has a cool safety check feature that can tell you if your friends have marked themselves "safe". It might be worth checking out if you have people you haven't heard from. 
I got banned for mentioning that the shooter is Muslim.
What did they do?
That is a *great* recommendation that I never would have thought of. 
I hope he comes out alright. Wish you the best
Always look for the helpers.  - Mr Rogers
Same thing happened at The Bataclan.
Also the same thing described by firefighters at the KISS nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil, where about 240 people died.
18th time he will have done this during his presidency. Shame. 
Cookies come to mind. And if you're in the area, you can make those! My thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this.
Target donated liked 500 cases of water, and the publix in South Downtown did the same. 
I live in Orlando, have AB positive, regularly donate plasma at the same center and I called in asking if they wanted me to come in.  They set an appointment with me for tomorrow.  Don't go down to one today as they are overwhelmed at the moment.  Call and set an appointment for later in the week.
For real. I was talking to a Sikh guy in my area once, and he told me that Sikhs wear turbans and keep small knives (kirpans) as an indicator to those around them that the Sikhs are there to help those in need.
I'm glad you're safe.  Something like this, happening in my own neighborhood... I couldn't even imagine.
Hey neighbor. You're lucky you weren't here. It was terrifying
People will say "you can't blame them." But I am totally blaming them. 
Him and the other 20 people densely packed in that alley, had the shooter found them they would have had no chance. It was an awful, awful thing but nobody knows what they would really do in a situation like that.
I'm so going to hear about this at school tomorrow.  Like Paris all over again. 
It really, really sucks.As someone who has personally lost friends (both muslim and non-muslim) to extremists, to see so many people blame our entire population hurts a lot.
Thank you for that. Feels sometimes like everyone hates all of us, even though we're also horrified at these acts.
For some reason, that I can't even explain, when I heard that the Orlando Mayor declared a State of Emergency it really sunk in. It's terrible, but you have to give all of the rescue works/police extreme credit. From the things I read the shooter had no plans on letting anyone in the club live. It's something that just makes you feel numb and sad. Thoughts are with all the people affected by this tragedy. 
I wouldn't be surprised if r/news loses default status over this. They are censoring discussion of a serious tragedy because of their political views. Though it doesn't matter *why* they're doing it, the fact is that THE default news subreddit is not allowing discussion of the absolutely most newsworthy event right now. I suspect the admins will do something in response.
Fuck killing people, it's stupid.
Bizarre that it can found here in an askreddit thread - unbelievable 
Awesome work from the off duty officer, even though he didn't get him, I'm assuming some people were able to escape during their firefight. Just hope he doesn't feel at fault for not being able to stop him. 
Officers rescued at least 30 individuals in the club. 
To be fair hindsight is 20-20 and the police might not have had all the info on what was happening on the inside, I'm sure it was very chaotic and they didn't want to charge in and make a mistake
I've lived in Orlando off and on my whole life, five years solid I've lived here now, this is by far the most tragic thing I've ever witnessed. Maybe because I'm older now and I can relate better, but the more the reports are finalized and the numbers sure up it's just horrifying to imagine these poor people. He didn't strike until 2 am and bars close at 3 so all of these people are trapped and likely totally inebriated by then. The DJ posted on FB that there was a gunman in the bar for everyone to run and get out of Pulse. I can't imagine the confusion as 300 people try to flee. 
Thanks for your kindness.  we need to stick together. 
Ah you made me smile ! Thanks for that. 
You know what it's still unreal to me sometimes. You forget it happened. And some morning it hits you and you're in hell. So so strange. Thanks for the kinds words. 
Angry about two guys kissing in Miami? You may as well get angry about the sun shining in Miami. What a fucking stupid crazy evil sonofabitch. 
His own parents said they believe the motivation was anti-gay.
You're mentally stable 
His parents weren't. Media likes controversy, don't forget. Next week is going to be really shitty for me -.-
i love how the character in the graphic is standing there awkwardly like 'so....yeah'
Agreed. It could be a really great resource if the images were simplified a little. 
Too many colors and shapes. I can't tell what's supposed to be what. 
If r/news isn't going to do its job, it's up to the most popular subreddits (like this one) to pick it up so the most people possible will be aware. Thanks for doing the right thing.
/r/news is currently losing 250 subscribers a minute
My girlfriends parents (Seniors) heard about this before I saw it on Reddit. 
Longest post lasted 5 minutes with hundreds of points.
What happened?
Reddit says its the front page of the internet. The fact we have to get info from non news subs makes me question that. This is how you piss off users, both acounted and casusal readers. Makes me think ill go somewhere else for the next big news story. 
Before he got into the pressroom they said this was the 15th time he has had to make a statement about a mass shooting.
CAN SOMEONE GET MOS DEF ON THE PHONE? I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HE MAKES OF ALL THIS
What the fuck is wrong with /r/news and is there anything we can do about that mod on a power trip
Thank you, anything helps! I think a lot of blood centers have reached capacity and recommends making an appointment for later this week. But they could definitely use the food and water. 
That is wildly specific! But true!
Mr. Rogers went to Rollins College, just 15 minutes from PULSE. 
Can you recommend any good alternatives? 
What happened this morning with the mods?
It's visible how much he has aged mentally and physically throughout his presidency.
We could always order stuff from Amazon Prime Now for them. Get them what they need.
It was pretty amazing, we got offered so many bottles of water and umbrellas while we waited!  
I dunno how their badass hats are gonna help but the thought is appreciated. 
I've heard gunshots before and I've gotten used to the routine. Close your curtain, turn off your lights, and stay away from the windows. But I remember the first time it happened, I was like 6 or 7 and it's absolutely terrifying. I can't imagine what it would be like to live your whole life only relatively peacefully only for a massacre to happen around the corner
I'm not even trying to be insensitive. As a gay man, this is terrifying to me. It's going to make me think twice about being open about my orientation to anyone who isn't a very close friend.
According to the edit, the alleyway was already filled with people piling on top of each other to get out a hole in the fence. I'm choosing to believe that guy barricaded the door to save the lives of the people he was witnessing, clamoring to get out of a fence.
I don't know about you but I'm blaming the guy with a gun
I mean, most victims of Islamic extremism are Muslims.  That's a fact that frequently gets overlooked or ignored.
A mass terrorist shooting in Orlando is a nightmare scenario, since it has so many theme parks. 
That'sounds because the mods of /r/news are pedantic, priggish, insulting, controlling ninnies.Remove /r/news from the front page!
Unsubbed /r/news . May I request everyone to please do the same and teach those biased mods a lesson. Throw their subreddit into the garbage.
I just realized I'm in /r/askreddit and not /r/news.
Tragedy strengthens our bond, and through that bond we find strength.
It depends. If it's an active shooter, they charge in ASAP. If it's a hostage situation, they try to negotiate. It seems like this was one masquerading as the other. They followed protocols for hostage-situation when the shooter had no intention to keep survivors. 
It's damned if you do and damned if you don't. If the police had charged in immediately and the guy had, for example, blown himself up and killed another 50 people... they'd be blamed for going in too fast. 
As another Frenchman here. Stay strong. We stand with you. I can barely imagine the dread and anger you must be feeling.I have only sadness and compassion for you guys.
FBI seems to be indicating there were ties to terrorism as well, so it may have been a planned attack
I'd imagine it's more "possible terrorism attack" and hate crime.
I work closely with a bunch of Muslims in the military.  I'm lucky that I live in a very international town that is friendly to everyone because I imagine they'd have a bad time in most of the country.  Stay safe.
>Comfort'So... you remember the time when you were shot in the head and died after five minutes of awkward conversation with a random stranger on a bar? That was pretty fun, wasn't it?'
>  250 subscribers a minuteDeservedly.   I just unsubscribed.  What we need is to channel all those former subscribers into a sub that does what r/news and others are supposed to do, but for some reason won't:  treat the news as more important than locking threads that try to discuss said news.
Goodbye /r/news
But the second Price died they were all up on it. This is one of the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil and what the fuck? 
Mods started nuking everything once FBI confirmed he was Muslim.
100% they've fucked it
WHERE IS JA?!?
UNSUBSCRIBE FROM /r/news !!
Every other sub. r/askreddit at this point. Why subscribe to something that isn't gonna do its job anyway?
either the mods or automods have been deleting most comments. said is was because people were doxing the shooters family, but they're even deleting posts with info on giving blood
I worked in the mortgage division of a bank at the time and about 3 or so of our applicants died on 9/11.  Normal protocol is to send a letter for withdrawal due to inactivity but I couldn't do it. Their spouses and family members didn't need to see another reminder of lives cut short.  I made a copy of the letter for their files and tossed the originals.  RIP
I hadn't thought of the impact those noises would have on the surviving firefighters. They absolutely would have known what that noise was and would have done anything to help them.
So I'll go ahead and say it. What was he doing for 3 hours? In 3 hours an incredible amount of fire can be put down, way more than what is needed for 103 dead and wounded. Do we know if he was out of ammo? 3 hours is just such a long time in a firefight
Our thoughts and hopes are with you, friend. Reading your comment gave me a different perspective. Previously this was a tragedy that happened hundreds of miles and an ocean away from me so there was a natural separation for me. Seeing the fear and hope in your words has truly brought this closer to me. I'm not properly explaining myself, but I hope you are ok and I hope your friend is safe. 
Can you imagine him being woken up at 4 o'clock this morning and what must have been going through his head. I mean when I get woken up in the middle of the night and it's bad news there's a limited amount of things that I think it might be. But as president of the United States oh my God could be anything.
Amazon should engineer a disaster relief button on their app where organizations like Red Cross and Blood Donation centers can create a wish list for anyone to buy and send to them. 
The turban is worn to show that the person wearing it is a Sikh. So that everyone who see can see that said person is a Skih. 
I'm not sure it was the shooter's intent, but that's literally the definition of terrorism.
Thanks for the clarification...That sounds a lot better than one guy closing and barricading the door behind him....Sucks to hear either way for sure...God what a terrible tragedy. My thoughts are very much with all the victims and families for sure...Today my heart aches.
Homophobia is shit.
I will unsub from /r/news but are there any better news subs? 
I can see they're actively removing threads for it...
The gas was a good idea but the execution of the whole event was awful. They didn't have enough medication to treat everyone affected by the gas and they let people choke to death unconscious. 
I strongly suspect this is an ISIS-fan terrorism attack. He probably had no actual ties to ISIS, just wanted to do "his part" to ... uhh what is it they want to do? Well killing gay people probably looked like a good way to help the global effort to this guy. 
Just...just keep your br- keep your brain in your head, man...it'll be alright...dude.
Well we wouldn't want to offend anyone by criticizing Islam would we? Better to censor all discussion about the ~~greatest~~ largest mass shooting in U.S. history. edit - a word because some people don't know that great doesn't always imply good
Help me Ja Rule! 
And tell the mods to fuck themselves
Actually though, shout out to the /r/askreddit mods because this was a better thread than the ones at /r/news.
There were a lot of things I did not want to ask. This was definitely on that list. It was hard enough having to know what was happening, I didn't want to know the details. I didn't want to know what people were having to do with their loved ones' posessions. I didn't want to know a goddamn thing about how hard the human tragedy was hitting everyone around me, because I was 19 and was not prepared in any way to deal with something like that.
I'm sure you have to become somewhat desensitized. You see a lot of shit in 8 years as Prez, at this point it's probably a sigh and an audible "fuck"
That is actually a genius idea. You should submit it to them. No joke.The only thing about amazon is that it takes a while for delivery. But I'm sure something could be worked out for situations like this. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people think the turban is a Muslim thing. 
It probably was his intent to some degree. He obviously wanted to scare/hurt the gay community, and force them out of the public eye.Screw that though. We as a nation and world need to make sure not to give creepy crazy people like this too much power.It is fully within their rights to think being gay is evil, and it is fully in their rights to express that verbally. Just as it is within my rights to think they are idiots. But when someone on any side crosses the line into violence people from every side need to band together to defend and protect the victims.
who was the shooter? What was so significant about him?
I guess that explains why this is in AskReddit
Unfortunately there are *dozens* of other news subreddits, none of which have the same subscribership as /r/news. This will fragment reddit's readership across all those subreddits. Maybe, in time, readers will migrate and settle down in one or two but, for a while, we'll have to probably browse several news-related subreddits to get a full range of facts and thoughts.This was a colossally bad move on the part of /r/news. I hope this is the end of that subreddit; it's the least they deserve.
Throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Gays, guns, Muslims, terror, we have pretty much everything contentious topic in this country in one event, of course it's going to be a shit storm. 
I remember watching a fascinating documentary about it. They had one of the Spetsnaz soldiers talking about why it went so badly - the emergency personnel just left the unconscious people on their backs on the pavement once the raid had been carried out. The Spetsnaz guys were dashing like madmen trying to put people on their sides in recovery positions and were furious the people they had just saved were dying needlessly.
They don't need direct contact in fact they prefer not to risk it. They just put out tons of information about who, what, where and how to carry out attacks and recently told people to step up attacks for Ramadan.
Isnt that CNN's motto?
Well, to be fair, that's not too hard to do...Heck, even the_donald had more objective information about the event than /r/news
I heard it on the *fucking radio* before I found it on Reddit./r/news mods should be ashamed. 
I agree 100% r/news is now dead. Worst censorship scandal ever. 
He honestly seems really upset every time there is an attack like this. It's something I really admire about him. Especially when he spoke about Sandy Hook, I felt like he was speaking as a father, not just as a president.  
"Honestly, if I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?"- Abraham Lincoln in response to an accusation by Stephen Douglas 
Yea I can agree with that, the most striking issues though are his hairline being insane and the forehead creases.
I think i will. Prime Now can deliver in 2 hours. Even if some sort of disaster extends that delivery window to much longer, it can still be pretty valuable. Amazon has massive wearhouses full of emergency essentials. This can also help to thwart misuse of funds a little if we are sending the necessary items directly.
I didn't yet but i will now.  What email address did you send to? Or did you just use the contact us link?
Probably because they'll be either Sikhs or Gurkhas. Both ideal company in faecal-impact-related turbine failures.
Yeah, I was talking about this with a friend earlier. One of the victims in Norway died a few days after the attack. It's definitely a possibility here, though hopefully they all pull through.
And someone higher up stated it was Hispanic night at the club.. So you can add another contentious aspect to your list. 
I don't understand. Why are the mods censoring? Like, what are they gaining from it? Thanks 
Subbed to them.  I'm also giving /r/USANews and /r/Full_News a chance as well.  
I think it's because he feels so powerless. This is one of those things that despite being the most powerful politician in the country no matter how much he wants change to happen and how hard he tries it simply won't happen. He has to make a speech anytime something like this happens and talk about how awful it is, all while knowing it will happen again and again. He knows why it's happening and how to stop it but he can't.
People think that our current presidential candidates say childish things to each other during debates.  When Lincoln and Douglas were debating everything was free game including the families of them both.
Hairline looks the same in both to me, just the first he has a comb-over masking that forehead puff.
I'm sure Amazon could kick in the accelerated delivery charge if people are buying disaster relief goods from their site... this is a really good idea
They even have power transmission towers shaped like Mickey Mouse.
My guess is that they delete any comment mentioning Islam. Only a guess, though. Can't imagine any other reason they'd delete so many comments.
I don't even think it's a matter of "could" as much as I bet they "would". I can't describe how much I love this idea. 
How do you claim your ISIS mega-reward when you're dead?
They were deleting comments of people telling others to donate blood in the area as well.
Usually they designate a family member or something like that. It's just like what Sadam did for Palestinian suicide bombers in the 90s. They go boom, he paI'd the family

That which is dead for millenia tends to stay dead; only by unholy machinations of a macabre nature could something be resurrected beyond its time.  It was in this way that John Hammond, entrepreneur, dabbler in necromancy, and generally respected man in society sought to play with life and death for personal gain.But that which sleeps beneath the earth yearns only to be surrounded by death.

Martians and humans both lived on giant dirt balls that spun and spun and ran circles around a giant fire ball. Humans sustained themselves by pushing calories wrapped in useless garbage through holes in their faces into squishy organs that converted the useless garbage into useful fertilizer and gave the calories to the rest of the body through a wildly elaborate freeway system in a sticky gooey fluid that some joker named after the same stuff that made up the giant fire ball: Plasma. Martians sustained themselves by stealing plasma from humans. So it goes.

The opening scene would have Bilbo Chinaski plastered to high hell in his derelict tree house while he starts *The Hobbit.* Frodo, not giving a Balrog's ass that Gandalf was coming to town, would be banging Rosie in the Green Dragon while Sam was out cutting the verge. I think, with no uncertainty, that Gimli would be the only character that wouldn't have to be rewritten.

No no, you're correct, or at least as far as I remember too. I meant it more, Pullman kills (lets God die) him in the book.

Margaret Atwood wrote a parallel perspective kind of work to Homer's Odyssey called the Peneloppiad, and it's fascinating. Would highly recommend.Also just cause I've never found anywhere else to put this on reddit, she came to my university to give a talk a couple years ago, and she was fucking hysterical the entire time. People left with their chests hurting from laughing so hard, it was amazing. That woman deserves so much respect.
He did write that one episode of Doctor Who, so I can actually kinda see this.

It kind of is?I mean there's anthologies of authors who will write Sherlock Holmes stories (I'm sure there's other examples I can't think of), and there's the stuff like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.There's also the stuff where they do re-tellings or base stories/movies on classic literature. So Clueless was loosely based off of Emma, Easy A was The Scarlett Letter, O was Othello.It exists in fan fiction too, but then you need to be able to weed through the shit to find the good stuff.Though, really someone said Stephen King and Twilight, and that would be fucking amazing. 
Is there a link to all the nominees and winners of that? I love original questions like this, instead of the unpopular opinion/irrational hatred/greatest movie of all time/ sexiest sex you ever sexed questions I see all the time.

> the vampires want to cuddleYour throat with their teeth
Same thing with the sparkly skin. The idea that vampires avoid sunlight for some reason *other than it hurts them* is a pretty cool idea. I wouldn't have gone with glittering diamond skin, but it's still a fun thought. Every other story I've read either has vampires hurt by the sun, or it doesn't affect them at all.The premise -and even the worldbuilding- had so much potential, but it wasn't very well executed in the end.
The Spy Who Came in from Ankh Morpork/ DiscWorld is Not Enough, if you will.
I recall Terry telling a story from a signing. Someone brought a book to him and said "look. I've worked it out. Ponder Stibbons, glasses, awkward boy who goes to a magical school. This is based on Harry Potter isn't it?" Terry turned to the front of the book and pointed out the 1992 publishing date. Equal Rites was also written a decade before Potter.

Some people are calling them the Greatest Expectations in history
Nah. They'd be forced to wander the desert to search for something they can't find, and once they find it, they can go home to the promised land. Only to find that what they were searching for is a mystic form of death itself. In doing so, making them quasi immortal because it takes so long to find it and they can't die until they do.
The first third is like that but it gets easier to read further in.
I mean, they take God out of the box (allusions to Pandora's box, with hope being left inside). So you're both kinda right. The kids accidentally kill God, and God likes it. Called the Authority in the book.Source: Wrote my MA thesis on it.

Holden Caulfield is teenage depression in writing
Stick to the stuff he actually wrote. After a while he got famous enough that he began "collaborating" with other authors. They write the books, using his characters and world building, and Clancy puts his name in big letters on the front of the book. The quality suffered immensely. Try Red Storm Rising to start. It's a stand alone work about war between NATO and the USSR set mostly in the north Atlantic and Europe.

I think it would more be that how everything is written and presented would change. The flavor of the text would change, even if the plot didn't. How an author chose to present the events might change as well, even if the events didn't."It was a dark and stormy night" evokes something different than "Rain fell. Thunder clapped. Twelve times the bell rung in the dark." or simply "It was night time and there was a storm." It all carries a different flavor to it even if all of it describes the same events.
dont forget to add about 5 different synonyms for ethereal and perhaps add some 'unknowable strangeness' or some such.

Seconded for Red Storm Rising. It's his second book after Hunt for Red October. I don't think he'd really planned on making Jack Ryan a franchise at the time. I think he was just writing books. Anyway, Red Storm Rising is a fantastic look at what modern day WWIII would look like using conventional Cold War weapons. I read this when I was in the Navy. No spoilers, but IIRC, the ship I was on was in the book at one point.

Quite a few apparently, I've seen several posts purporting to be from blind people. Using text to speech and brail keyboards is the most common method 
Are you dating a blind man?
I'm pretty sure it's a cultural trope that most people (men and women, gay and straight) prefer to close their eyes while kissing and turn the lights down (or even off) during sex. We might think we're all about visuals, but actually when it comes down to it, there's a lot more going on that we often don't think about.
TIL I might be gay
For real, are you blind and gay? Because if so we want a more substantive answer. 
But how do you know you wouldn't like a girl's dong in your ass?
I mean... It's kind of the same as asking how blind people could be attracted to women. Because they can't see doesn't mean they don't have a sex drive.
Or how gay straight blinds know they are people
Woah buddy c'mon now, one question at a time and I believe OP asked first.
No it would have hurt it.  Here's why.  The sample size this pertains to it ridiculously small,  Gay, Blind, and on Reddit I think 5 of them would be a high estimate.  So a serious tag gets a lot less comments and a lot less attention if its this specialized so with a bunch of pricks goofing around you're liable to head toward the front page, where it might be found by one of the five.  
A non-trivial percentage of people have accessibility issues but still use the internet! They rely on things like screenreaders to read the text for them, and accessibility-forward design like high contrast colors, big fonts, etc.Source: I work for a company that cares a lot about accessibility in our apps.
I also remember seeing an AskReddit about how blind people know they're done wiping. My favorite answer was, "when it stops feeling greasy". I can never not think that now.

Up close, sure, it's delicious. But if you can smell it "from afar", there's something wrong with it. 
I can usually sense the sex of people close to me if we're close enough, even if i can't see them.  I dunno if it's smell specifically though, i think we're kinda wired to be cued in to the differences.  Animals always seem to know.
I don't see the humor in your comment.

Assisted reading devices/programs. Basically software that reads a page out loud for you.
I think Reddit fuzzes subscribers and online sub's in a similar fashion to the way in which the fuzz votes. I once created a completely random sub, and within one second (literally immediately after creating it) there were like 13 subs and 70-odd online. Obviously that was complete BS.

That's really depressing.  I'm going to make a point to share his story with the "being gay is a choice " crowd. This guy's case is yet another example of where "choosing" to be gay has literally no benefits and leads to a sadder life. No way he "chose" to be gay. Thanks for the response. 
Tone of voice, volume, flirtatious phrasing, the sharing of laughter -- all of these are strong non-visual indicators of interest that blind and seeing alike can share... (besides, of course, permissable touch). I don't think they should be dismissed as less important than eye-contact.

that's because you're cuddling a sand sculpture dressed in your ex's clothes. 
And some straight people like dick-shaped objects in their ass too!
Shitposts give off a stronger smell than most other posts.
I work with a few seminary students in my office. Their new reasoning is that being gay is a mental illness and should not be catered to. 
your story is almost identical to mine. I attracted to this one guy's voice and liked the sound of his laugh. turns out he wasn't bad looking either, but i don't think i would have talked to him nearly as much and gotten to know him if i didn't like how he sounded and just wanted to get him to talk more. we just celebrated out third anniversary last fall
What a relief!
The conspiracy theory is Stevie wonder has been playing us for all these years. 
> He seemed rather surprised when I told him "dude, if you're telling me you're gay, I've known for a long time"I once did this but I got it wrong. Ohhhhh the cringe.
I am a straight male but I get along WAY better with women and gay guys.  My two best friends are gay guys (both of whom I've known since childhood.) Why?  It seems like most of the straight guys I know are always trying to make fun of each other or out-wit each other, crack jokes, or talk about sports.--I don't like small talk, and I'm not into sports very much.  I like deeper, conversation-type questions and...conversations.  I hope that makes sense.  So, unfortunately, it's really, really hard for me to make new friends.
I mean this in the most encouraging way.  If you want this, work on yourself; focus on yourself.  When you get frustrated with your significant other, practice a thirst for finding how you could be wrong (and then, admitting it). It starts out painful and ends up addicting!
*wipes away a tear* I know. It was beautiful.
This is truly an eye opening comment for me. 
I tried to stifle a laugh while pooping and hurt my butthole.
You're wonderful! 
Did the blind gay person even know about Undertaker throwing Makind from Hell in a Cell in the first place?
Thank you to leading me to this glorious person. This is like reading poetry written by a particularly raunchy poet.
True, but I suppose, if it aint broke, don't fix it, haha. My screen reader reads the button perfectly fine at least.
Do you smell like doritos?
WHY DO YOU SAY THIS!!!
Now I wonder why I'm not into bestiality.
I thought it was a guy sucking a dick. I mean it was what the thread was about, so we were already there.
I would enthusiastically suck a dick for $2500 too. Spend $100 on liquor and roofies afterwards then you just wake up with $2400 in your pocket and no idea how it got there. 
Username checks out.
Weather's nice
Ferrets don't have sweat glands, so...
My search history now contains the question "can ferrets sweat".
Dude. I got you.For people who don't want to click, this is a sub about putting your dick in your own ass. They say it's the best thing ever but it looks really uncomfortable.Apparently the goal is to put your balls in there too, what a world!Also I am triggered and literally shaking because of these shitlords who have big enough dicks that they can *fuck themselves*. Mine doesn't even reach past the gentleman vegetables. 
I think you mean RIP her guy's outbox.
What're you, a frog?
Nah, just sucked the wrong dick.
Alot of straight guys like a finger in the ass as they get a BJ.
This joke was so bad you need to frieze all further efforts at humor
use Reddit Is Fun next time lol, it lets you see the link before you go on the website :)
that would be so epic
One of my favourite subs
This seems like it would be easy to play off as a joke though. I'm guessing you didn't think of that in the moment though.
I think you missed your target with that quoted word.
Sounds like we *ALL* won... ;)
My straight-guy friendships go through stages. Surface interactions around sports/jokes/events/girls, into deeper chats about politics, etc., and then into insights into their relationships, their feelings and goals and fears, etc.At each stage you lose a lot, until at the end I have just a few core friends that I'm so open with, and they're open in return. But it's worth it, and it definitely happens with men. If you want it to.
Being poly just seems so exhausting, on top of the jealousy it would surely cause in me. I only have time for one woman. I have video games to play! 
Thanks man!  I know.  But sometimes I think being torn between two genders is a damn curse when everyone around you is so sure about themselves.
Easy there friend! Gentle unto that sweet butthole, you only get issued the one.
Oh stop it you!
It's not a story a Jedi would tell you. 
I've been duped by Vargas a number of times. Never disappoints.
More like chipotle.
#STOP SAYING THAT!
Can't help you there, ask a Welshman. 
>I thought it was a guy sucking a dickYou ever take one of them Rorschach tests? Freud would like a word with you...
Woah.....   omg.....  I'm also too high for this.... but I think I just witnessed an amazing joke....a super mega dark joke
No you have reading. 
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
I have no interest in clicking, but I'm curious about the logistics. I assuming these guy are tucking their dicks under and between their legs to insert into their butthole. Impressive lengths aside, surely this can't be done when the dick is hard? But if it's soft, how could they possibly get it in? So many questions, so little desire to be scarred for life!
Jesus dude. You start small, you don't bring out the Giant Black Horse Banger the first time you peg a guy. 
Ok I sucked a different dick. The good news is I got my job back. The bad news is now I have a reputation to uphold.
It was a bust.
not even on mobile
I'm seriously amazed at the content on that sub. The post are so believable as an episode. 
Depends on if you're normally a dick like that though. I know I am so I could easily do it, but if you never joke?
>like why he never had a girlfriend but had plenty of guy 'friends'.Is that better?
So say we all! ;)
You're not being torn dawg. You just get to enjoy the best of both worlds 
Yeah. There are certainly some cases where it will be a shitpost that you don't realize it's a shitpost until the end, the 3.50 sea monster for example. Overall though, I find shitposts funny, so it doesn't bother me personally.
Now I'm just wondering how many times Microsoft Sam has spoken these words.
Duped? No, you have had the pleasure of basking in the wonder and glory that is a /u/_vargas_ post. Consider yourself among the lucky ones, the vast majority of humanity to this point has been in the dark, not knowing they were missing the majesty ofhis beautiful prose.
We sure solved that one. This must be what Scooby and the Gang feel like when they rip the monster mask off the villain guy. 
WHAT? I CANT HEAR YOU ABOVE THE SOUND OF ALL THIS SHOUTING.
I feel this is a rare chance to respond to a comment simply because I'm Welsh on Reddit. But in doing so would imply I'm into beastiality....Argh well, I'm replying anyway.I'm here for any questions
Yeah because even with the small sample size he's technically gay unless he plays with some more dicks. 
That'll be 3 shmeckles please. 
And don't call me Comprehension Problems.
Now, because of the logistics, I think I will have an interesting shower filled with science, self discovery, and disgust. 
Well that answers some questions I had...
That's not all you have to uphold, eh eh?(I'm talking about balls)
Its a marble you could come up with that joke.
> Depends on if you're normally a dick like that though. I know I amOh thank god you knew. I didn't wanna be the one to have to tell you!
I'm in a successful straight relationship of 6 years.  She was the first person I really opened up to about it.  The bonus is, I guess you could say the relationship is "open" and I get to explore who "me" is.I think if I was expected to be either gay or straight and didn't have an understanding partner, I'd go nuts.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know...
A surprise, to be sure. 
Because of how stoned Shaggy always was?
SHOOTING* ftfy
It's said the welsh invented the condom, thousands of years ago, from the intestines of a sheep. Later, an Englishman realized you could remove them from the sheep first!
You're doing it correctly then.
Well, he's enjoyed 72.72% (repeating oc) of the genetalia he's played with. 12.5% of those he enjoyed were dicks.
Needs to really cradle the shaft if he wants a *raise*. 
That joke broke the mold. 
I never understood why there are people who get upset if their partner is bi. It's not like they're going to cheat on you BECAUSE they're bi, and if it's before or after you, why does it matter? Love and let love. 
What do you think Scooby Snacks are?
The first I've heard of this. Blaspheme 
Like half melted marshmallow.Some of the clingy ones, but due to the Sheer numbers (don't know if sheer counts as a slight pun... I'll take it) they know what's going on. They get around just as much as we do. This is also applicable for the 3rd question.
If you're gonna twist the numbers I can do that too. 100% of the genitalia he did not enjoy were female. Also, we don't have enough information to prove your numbers are correct. You're just guessing. 
Good old basic steamed rice. The only thing added will be the food that you give.

I let my friend borrow my webcam for a while, but I might do a similar thread where I eat more foods over something else.

Are all these ratings theoretical? Or are you trying each response yourself?
i didn't realize everybody was teleporting the food to you. 
Pass, rice milk is not my favorite 
Snap! Crackle! Pop!Rice Riceys!
That's because you didn't pair it with your finest milk steak.
How old is the average Redditor, anyway?
Are you claiming to actually be eating these combinations? I don't see how that's possible since most of your comments are only a minute or two apart.
wat.  Rice is 10/10 but pumpkin pie is only 9?!  I call BS.

Really? That sounds awful.

I love this thread so much!!
Use chocolate cake.

You delightful weirdo
I could imagine sticky rice wrapped around a hot dog and lightly fried until the rice is crispy would be quite tasty
Implying that there is a right cereal to be rice-d.
You should make a site doing nothing but this.I know I'd go to it.
Bacon and rice is pretty good tho
Alright that sounds good. will try.

I like you, OP.
That actually sounds pretty close to kheer. Find a kheer recipe and cook some up. Yum.
Didn't even thank for the suggestion

Fair enough, genuinely wasn't expecting that.

You could burn the rice considerably. That would make it pretty bad.

This is seriously so awesome of you. My dad has cancer and my mom has trouble taking care of him and our big yard. Our neighbors who we rarely talk to have started mowing our yard when they mow theirs. It means so much to just have someone help. Way to go! 
I would love that, but I'm just chronically depressed and anxious. Don't want you to be taken advantage of. 
My sister has this.  She's doing a lot better than when she was first diagnosed but it was rough the first couple of years.  That is very nice of you to offer your support for those struggling with similar diseases. 
Take him anyway, even if the kid is in a carrier.  Let your Dad talk to him and tell him about fishing and show him things.  Record it with your phone and save a copy to your computer and keep it for when the kid gets older. Learning those things from a Grandfather is just absolutely awesome, even if it is years after that time it actually happens.  Also, watching your Dad talk to your kid will be something special for you as well.
It's good to accept it, with some things that's all you can do. My mother also has severe cirrhosis of the liver and probably has a year or two left. 
This is a great idea! I'll look into the the 501(c)(3) requirements to create one. Anyone know what the best way to be visibility on this is?
Try and explain it to us on reddit. 
I'm a mod at /r/redsox, I'll keep you in mind as sometimes last minute tickets show up on the sub. Do you live close to Fenway for short notice games or would you require some more advanced notice? Weekday vs. weekend games?
That's why you should always dress nicely. You never know when you'll die unexpectedly and be stuck with that as your ghost outfit forever.
Tattoos are hard work, that's very generous of you.
It depends. If it's old school chemo yeah it can be ugly. But there a lot better treatments now. They can analyze the cancer mutations and find the best chemo. If your cancer has a known mutation then targeted chemo can knock it out, or at least buy you a lot more time with possibly fewer side effects. More and more cancers are being treated this way everyday.So at the very least, ask. Even get the biopsy/genetics done. Then the doc can tell you more.

I need something from you.I need you to continue to be a good person. I need you to be kindness in a world that drowns out all the good and hope with the thunderous sound of artillery fire. I need you to be a beacon of solidarity, and to give something back to the world. We all know the planet is fucked as it is, but I need you to make it a better place. We all need to make it a better place.I sincerely hope that you get out of this rough spot you mentioned. If there's anything I can do for you, even if it's just a quick chat, I'm only a PM away. Let me know.ITT: me getting emotional

No, that means we're too late!
The Christmas tree is making me cry. Thank you for taking such loving care of your elder kitty.
Thanks. I've been journalling the past months for each of them and just basically rambling and telling stories. I've thought about the birthday cards idea as well, but haven't done it yet. Great thoughts about the video hike! I'll definitely add that things to do for them!
Please do! Your post today likely changed a lot of lives (from the comments I've read), so thanks!
I have been fortunate enough to know 8 of my grandparents and great grandparents. Some have passed and I know how much little things like not having the yard mowed can get to someone. Also it's one less thing that the family had to do. Hopefully they spend an extra hour with their grandma.

Hmm, my mother is getting toward the end of her own journey. I'll ask her if she'd like some mailbox pick-me-ups. Thanks for the idea!
Your awsome.. hope others tell you from time to time.
this a million times!  My dad passed away 2 weeks ago from pancreatic cancer and the night before he passed away I took his hand in mine and told him everything that was in my heart. That I forgive him, I apologized if I ever was too harsh on him at times and that one day we'll be riding rollercoasters together again be it in this life or the next. He was a pilot in his younger days and loved anything that had to do with adrenaline.  He passed away the next morning and as painful as it was, I was happy I talked to him.  Sending you internet hugs

My mom died of cancer when I was little and I so wish she had done this. I hear stories about it a lot and it always makes me  sad that my mom didn't leave me anything to remember her by, like a letter or even just pictures. Please consider this! Best of luck to you and your family! 
> and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).Imma guess you're a tall thin male?
Call her, my mom passed away recently. And I would give everything and anything to see her, even hear her voice or cough again. You never really know how much you truly need that person till they are gone.
You are an awesome person. Thank you. I already bought that expansion for him as a Father's Day gift, but thank you for the suggestion!
No, please keep it! He won't be able to keep it for long, so it's better kept by you. THANK YOU for the offer, though 
I think I understand your comment and if it's what I think it is, than thank you so much. What an awesome gesture!!!

I'm glad to hear your sister is doing much better! The first years are the hardest and a series of trial and error till you find what routine works for your body. I hope she keeps kicking butt!
Totally agree...i missed an opportunity for my son to meet his great grandmother before she died. Even if he never remembers it, having a picture or video of that fishing trip would be priceless.
I was in 3d animation and design for a long time. Wanna do a video together? I'll handle the visual aspect.
Are you allowed to go on the bone marrow registry? Where I live they don't want my blood because I grew up in the UK but I have registered to donate bone marrow.
Nah, just the whole if i wanna end on my terms or not and how in the back of the head.
My mom had hep c for most of her life and was getting bad cirrhosis. She got approved after trying for a long time to get Harvoni, she went through it and is since completely clear of hep c and her liver is going back to normal. If you can get your insurance to approve it, it really does work.
I've got a chest freezer and questionable morals would be a good writing prompt 
As someone with a fatal (eventually) chronic illness, trust me, none of us think we can do it until we're in the situation. Then the options are killing yourself or living with it. What would you do? People like me often hear that we're very strong. But really, it's more like lack of options.
Depending on the country, that may or may not be true. 
My Uncle died of the same cancer as well. My mother was in denial so my wife and I pushed her hard to go out there as much as possible. He lived five months from diagnosis and she ended up being there when he passed. All things considered that was a good last five months where they focused on being together as a family.
I know where to get a 2,000 lbs crate of dry macaroni. (Seriously, they're huge) 
Thank you, I appreciate it! I'm more scared for my kids if anything, you know? I don't want them to be scared or worried. They are all under 6, so I obviously haven't told them. I left work for the pregnancy, and now this. Times are tough.If you don't mind me asking, what did you have done to get rid of it? 
That's absolutely badass and I sincerely hope he takes you up on that offer. 
Wow thanks.  With the Reddit Secret Santa always a success, im sure Redditors will be more than happy to help fellow Redditors who are down and needed a smile.
How'd you end up with the permanent pain?
Appreciate it :).I tried lyrica, along with pretty much everything else. Sadly I get the same effect: nothing. I don't know why but drugs in general don't seem to work on me, I always feel the same as before.This unfortunately extends to painkillers as well. I have oxy and stuff (prescribed) but even that doesn't really worK well enough to bother and simply increasing the dosage won't ever end well.
Thanks for the compliment, but I'm certainly no angel and have been a selfish, petty ass for the majority of my life. I hope I can provide a better direction for my nephew though, and if that's all I accomplish in this life, it's enough for me.
You would do that? That's incredible! If there are weekend tickets sometime this season, I'd never be able to thank you enough. Wow.
I'd rather die in sweat pants and an old T-shirt, and be a comfy ghost for all eternity.
I've never been so early to a sprog comment. But, fuck man, that was beautiful. You're seriously talented.
I too ask for Guac. 
I am a nigerian prince who has a sick son, but I cannot help him without $10,000 wired directly to my bank account. This will help me pay the fee to the bank to release my tens of millions of dollars. I will of course send you some for your troubles
I am actually surprised this thread turned out as well as it has so far without being labeled serious. Bravo, Reddit. 
Nooooooo!!!
And take (or have someone else take) videos of yourself *with* your kids. They will want to look back and see their relationship with you, and the love you had for them. 
Order some postcards online and get some stamps.  Write to her when you've got something to say.  It only takes a minute or two.  Send her some postcards and stamps in case she wants to write back.  Dementia grandmas don't check email, but postcards matter to them.
Not this time. We are talking about it via PM. It should happen when they come down. I'll keep you posted. 
Thanks! Sorry to hear about your father. Even though he isn't here, I still appreciate his service. In regards to scatter his ashes from a Coast Guard boat, it's totally doable. We've done at least 2 or 3 memorials and scattered ashes since I got down here in 2014. Just reach out to your local Coast Guard unit and see what they have to say. No promises though. 
I would encourage anyone new to this thread to not move forward in reading comments unless you are strapped with the tissues.  This thread appears to be cutting onions. 
I'm in, too. Also, there's a sub r/randomactsofcards (i think) they'd probably help as well if you post there.
Canada here, would love to send a card! 
 That's what I'm hoping. This is so doable, as another redditor pointed out!
My parents are both alive but this never occurred to me and has me reevaluating my relationships with them. I feel undeserving like I take them for granted when I really don't, I don't think. 
You can still have a headstone if you get cremated. Everyone on my Dads side who has died has headstones next to eachother but they all got cremated. Saves on space too!
"I would offer you two but I only have one"
Interested as well. Japan is a great place.
That's very sweet, but don't shed a tear on my behalf. Ive spent a lot of time and money on vapid, selfish arrogance and complete disregard for the feelings of others.Im just trying to put a dent in my innumerable sins.
Not OP, but also had a spontaneous pneumothorax and yep! Tall thin male.
I'm an FFXIV player too. I'd be willing to get him a little something for in-game. Do you know his character's name and server?
Not too be morbid...but maybe your dad could just look after it for a while and you could mail it back to u/tsukihi3 once your dad doesn't need it anymore?
Yup! I have some hope that CRISPR may eventually help cure genetic diseases like this, but I rather doubt we'll see it in her lifetime, or mine for that matter. At the very least, even if it does come out and becomes widespread, I think there will already be too much permanent damage, but at least we could seriously help future generations.
My paternal grandfather was dying in the same hospital I was born in, and my mom told me when I was younger, that my dad grabbed teeny-brand-new me, ignored all the nurses, and brought me to see his father for one visit before he passed on. My dad's a whacko, but I'm glad he did that.
We definitely could
Wouldn't having hep make you nonviable as a donor?
Liver, I believe.
I have had hep c and b since I was 18. I'm over 60 now.  Main thing is avoid alcohol.  Also avoid rough sports where you could get struck where your liver is.  Don't dwell on it and try to lead a normal life. The doctors told me I would die of cirhossis or liver cancer. Jokes on them,  I'm dying from lung cancer. Just take it one day at a time and remember,  everybody dies,  and doctors are not always right.  Good luck. .
>If you can get your insurance to approve it, it really does workUgh, the real death panels.
I finished a 3 month course of Harvoni recently, my stepfather is Egyptian and managed to source it for me from Egypt. It was $600 total. It breaks my heart and saddens me that such an amazing cure is so inaccessible here when it's so cheap everywhere else. 
In Canada and the US it is. Unless the person co signed, the debt dies with the debtor. The only chance for collection is from the estate of the deceased, but unlikely there would be any assets to distribute to debtors in any case. 
This is what I am terrified of.  There is no happily ever after with this tumor.  The outcome scares me to death and I don't want to think of a life without him, but know that is reality.  I am so sorry for everyone's losses.  Cancer sucks, but Glioblastoma is a horrific asshole that never goes away (sort of like my ex-husband).
My wife and I work in a hospital, I wish more people understood this simple logic. Don't prolong someone's life for your own selfish desires. 
Has this treatment made the front page? I don't know. I don't know if they have even released any of the data. But all large clinical trials like this should have a data and safety monitoring program. At some point it became unethical to continue with a placebo group when the preliminary data showed it to be effective to a certain degree.  This does not mean the great majority of people are cured though.  But her dad is still going strong with no growth of his tumor!
...Where is this pasta heaven and do they have take out
I have no cervix now.  They cut it all out because it didn't spread, and then I took some pill form of chemo just to make sure.  It was super easy, but like I said, the waiting for the results was the WORST.  :(  Also, I don't have kids, so between that and my missing ovary due to another medical issue, I'll probably never have them, so that sucks too.And yes - telling the kids definitely requires something more definitive. :)  
> Fucking Reddit. I ~~like~~ *love* this place.FTFY
Are you near a library? I found the first one available for borrowing at my local library website!
Took a bad fall while snowboarding. Apparently my joints in my back are permanently inflamed.
I'm basing this solely off the resistance to painkillers and other medicines, but do you have any of the markers for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome? I know it can cause resistance to anesthesia and other drugs, so it might be worth at least a quick Google search if you've never been tested for it. 
I'm pretty sure he's never written a comment in non-poem form. Hold on I'll ask him. OH great almighty Mr. /u/Poem_for_your_sprogHave you ever written a comment in non poem form all along?
"I meant," said Ipslore bitterly, "what is there in this  world that truly makes living worth while?" Death thought about it, "cats" he said eventually, "cats are nice." 
Take your upvote!
I'd like to send one too please. Also, you're a good friend.
Now I'm just imagining like, the IRS of cat pictures, stalking Redditors for what they owe ;D
You guys are awesome. This is why i love reddit so much, hope he gets in contact with you guys. keep being selfless people
A man can build a thousand bridges in his lifetime, but if he fucks just one goat he is known as a goat-fucker rather than a bridge-builder. 
Same checking in here. Well I was thin at the time. After it happened I put on 25 pounds of muscle to try and prevent it happening again. One can hope
"Myself and the rest of the shareholders will be eternally grateful for his tireless efforts to increase our quarterly dividends, and he will be sadly missed.  He worked his fingers to the bone and my accountant says it was entirely worth it."

My mom went into labor with me and a couple of hours in my grandfather died. Labor stopped. Mom says I stayed a while to meet him and get to know him a bit.I am an atheist, but I still like that story.
Very good. PM me, we'll trade details. Let's talk to him and see what he has in mind. Shouldn't be too hard.
Oh yeah? If you think THAT'S impressive, next time I go, I'm going to give them 16 gallons! 
Some parts are still useable for others. Additionally being a donor also gives permission to use your organs for research, so their organs could help others who have the desease in the future.
Huh. I've never been tested for a match to anything before. Where can I go to get put on a donor list for my spare organs/bone marrow?
You too friend, how bad are the lungs?
My brother-in-law was able to buy it for $1000 from somewhere overseas. Maybe India? He's working on getting another course for my sister. If anyone wants any more info PM me and I'll ask him for specifics. 
I'm very sorry for what you're going through. Regardless if you have three months or 30 years left with him you both can still have many positive memories. Focus on each other and fuck cancer.
I work in a hospital. One thing I often want to say to family members is, please don't let your loved one die here. Take them home. As long as they're here, we'll poke and prod them until they or you say "stop."Most people don't realize that being in a hospital is the least comfortable you can be if you're dying or ready to stop treatment. It breaks my heart to have to stick a needle into a 95 year old for a blood test that is irrelevant at this point, but he's here and we have to show that we're doing something. It also really makes me angry at the system.
It depends, can you carry a ton of macaroni?  
I'm sorry about that :( there is always adoption, or other options, if you decide having a child is right for you and your future :)How was the process and recovery of them cutting it out?
I read it as love the first time. 
Yup - I have tons of knowledge in this area. :)  If you want you can PM me and we can talk about it.  I probably don't have time to handle the day to day but I can definitely help with paperwork, process, and technology side :)  Almost like a board member :-P
dela where?
I'm so sorry to hear this.I'm 26 and dealing with a shoulder injury which might have ended my ability to rock climb.  I already have shin and knee issues that prevent me from doing any sports involving running.  Without my constant climbing (2 to 3x a week) I've already begun to gain weight and I've been really upset about it.That being said - the injury doesn't prevent me from doing day-to-day things or interfere with my work.Really puts things in perspective.I wish you the best, and congrats on the marriage!
I think it's crazy that opiates/oxy has no effect, on him. Like, if you upped the dosage enough, it'll numb it all but possibly get you so high you wouldn't like it. If those don't work, would weed really be strong enough?
he has on his ama
The one time upboat makes sense and we blew it.
I'm in Santa Clara and a neighbor has 4 VW buses in his driveway, should I go show him this thread? Not too sure what that'll accomplish but ya never know, people know people and it really is a small world sometimes..
I fucking love Reddit 
I always love to see older gentlemen/woman enjoying Video games!I'll login tonight and see about sending him something.
You guys are amazing, this should be higher up. And as for you, someeyes, stay blessed fam!
Not as bad as some others I know.  Have to be careful is the main thing.  I cough up blood sometimes,  and sometimes I just have to rest no matter how much I want to keep up.  Short of breath from doing just about anything.  Tired a lot but still have to take care of myself,  do my chores, stuff everybody has to do.  Not getting any younger. 
Developing countries are exempt from pharmaceutical patents, so Egyptian companies can sell it for much cheaper. 
And also it's sometimes hard to even see it like that. People say, "How am I being selfish, I'm helping you live longer," without taking the time to really talk about it. Euthanasia is an extremely difficult subject for us to talk about without seeing it as giving up but after 70, 80, 90 years of life and only seeing pain and suffering at the end of the tunnel, it's a conversation we must have and actually WITH the person in question, and not FOR them.
I'll bring the truck around
SUPER easy.  I mean, it's not the most pleasant when it's occurring, but I was walking the next day like nothing had happened.  You have to wear pads though, and no tampons or anything for a while.   :)  Overall I'd say it's one of the easiest (but grossest because of the whole pad thing) medical procedures available.  
Count me in as well. I don't know how I can help, but I have a lot of spare time that I can donate to this if it can take off. PM me or whatever if you need help with logistics or visibility I guess. I can also help with funding a little. 
Dela there
Opiates don't affect my mom, but weed does. It doesn't fully get rid of the pain, but it takes it from 'it hurts so much it's hard to move' to 'there's a bit of an annoyance but it can be overlooked'.It's different for every person, but there's enough varieties of weed that there might be a strain out there that can help.
Goddamn it. 
Someone post this to /r/FFXIV. Let's do something nice. 
That makes me feel a lot better. So they kept you awake through it? I'm a wuss when it comes to pain and procedures. 
again, it went unnoticed.
Lol, another XIV player here, willing to help in anyway I can
Oh you can't miss it lol, I got multiple emails, texts, letters, and phone calls, even other members of my family got phone calls asking to get in touch with me. If they manage to match you they'll make sure they find you one way or another.  
Yeah - I stayed awake, but honestly, I would recommend going under.  I did it because I just wanted it over with, but if I had it to do over again I would definitely do twilight anesthesia or something if your insurance covers it. :) 
Not this time.
That's terrifying, but reassuring. *If they want your marrow, they'll find you. Don't worry.*
Take your upboat! :D 
There are already a bunch of articles about this exact topic. From what I gather from a few of them, pollsters were thrown off by the voters who didn't want to admit they supported Trump (being called "Shy Trump" voters), and by the rural white folks who tend not to respond to pollsters' calls but turned out in huge numbers in this election. I'm sure that this election will bring about a change in the pollster profession. Most of them got schooled yesterday. 
'Well there was this cartoon frog on the Internet...'
I don't see anything changing after the GOP was rewarded for 6~ years of obstructionism... :/Even if the Dems swing back into power in 2018 (highly unlikely), gridlock will be the new norm now that it's been proven to work. Politics above country.
I'm surprised no one else really commented on this. He was really struggling at the end. I got the impression he really needed to go to the toilet too. 
The next episode is going to be legendary

Back to coma
I know right? I can't fucking believe it.Trump actually won. Trump will be our president. President Trump.This is the most... interesting? News I've ever read while taking a dump.The next few South Park episodes should be pretty interesting.
Given he's flipped flopped on TONS of social and political topics in the last few years, it's entirely possible. 
"I'm sorry, but you need ten years experience for this job starting out at minimum pay."Fuck you, Trump is president despite never holding office in any other sense of the word. I can sit at this computer for eight hours just fine.
I've never seen a more resounding "We don't like you". 
The Simpsons are always right
I hate that I have to upvote this.
It's not shocking at all to me.  As a bartender, there have been many a group discussion on politics while CNN played on the TVs.  Everyone would murmur how "both candidates suck" and how we're screwed.However, once the crowds cleared and there was nothing left but one-on-one conversation with the guests and I, their pro-Trump colors would show.
And then >= 2 of his choices on the Supreme Court. :(
May you live in interesting times. 
No supreme court as well.

"The Berenstain Bears universe."
Is this true? Source? 
And both will be covered by Huffington Post in their entertainment section.  They said it themselves last year.
i feel like a lot of trump support wasn't vocal about it because of being taboo in a lot of sense. but when it came to the poll they were free to vote how they really wanted
I would like to reset the time line please....
That's the scary part to me too. Even if something were to happen and Trump were to step down, we would have *Pence,* who supports gay conversion therapy, very not pro choice, pro religion in government, etc. Trump is dangerous, but he seems to mostly want the title and the power to me, while Pence knows what he wants to do.
What I could only ever see as a joke has now become a reality. I feel like I'm being trolled by the entire American population. 
I keep thinking Trump was selected as an easy candidate to be beaten by Clinton. Some people's plan got fucked hard.
Clinton campaign made the party stonewall him out of the nomination
Trump vs Kanye in 2020Like seriously what the actual fuck
Plus the Cubs won the world series... Back to the Future II is literally our reality. 
"My name is Barack Obama, and I'm the Presidentiest man alive."

It's only rigged when it might go against your choice. When it comes out in your favor, then it's only because the conspiracy failed to take hold. 
Oh crap!  Trump won!  Oh we never thought it would happen so we voted for him.
Rip EPA funding. Sorry for disappointing you Leo looks like we'll probably end up behind China in terms of renewable energy with the way trump has campaigned. 
And the best part is that it's 9/11 for most of the world.
Dude, the post is set to new.
Honestly, he alone does not scare me. I don't think he even knows what he believes, he is incredibly wishy washy and rolls around in simplified rhetoric. However, the SCOTUS, the house and the senate are all aligned with a party I do not agree with on to many matters; And they may have more sway of the new president in matters than you would want in a leader. 
>>Grandpa, what was 2016 like?>A fucking dumpster fire of a year ~~kid~~ smoothskin.ftfy
I do, but I'm also female. Is that okay?
David Bowie's death unraveled the logic of the universe.
Then you would have enough money to build mars colony.
Most of them have got schooled this entire year. They have routinely failed to predict anything, confirmation bias is a bitch. To be fair though the prevalence of cell phones makes polling difficult and the closet trump supporter  is impossible to quantify. They had the same problems with Nixon.
We joke, but the Internet had a huge impact on this campaign. It gave Trump a platform by which he turned from a laughing stock to a legitimate contender. "Discuss the influence of Internet memes in the politics of 2016" could definitely be a history question in a few decades. 
100% national healthcare is repealed. 
I don't think I heard anything Trump said. It was just hilarious watching his head bob up and down and him snap back awake lol
Yeah I realized that as well but it was still funny to see lol. He did well because we all know at his age he was also bored to death.
Has he done it for the primary bet?
Don't forget literally the whole entertainment industry
It should be 20 minutes of him shouting no at a camera. It would be art. 
They got Bernie.
I think people want to think of it as Berenstain because us little fucks couldn't spell for shit.
We have to keep them around as an early warning system
Trump said he was going to end all federal green energy initiatives. What kind of example is that?America just fucked the world.

Yup he even use to be democrat and Clinton's friend
Pence is insurance against assassination.
Well shit you're right. You're MY boss now.
Thats what should be taken away from this. This was the democrats election to lose, all they had to do was put up fucking anyone else. Just some bland everyman or woman. But nope. They wanted a Clinton.

Mutually Assured Destruction. Trump is a genius because if someone gets rid of him, the country gets destroyed by Pence. Always gotta have a Nuclear (Pence) deterrent.
This episode of Black Mirror is a little too weird for me. 
Exactly, I didn't vote for him either, but his tone and the content of his message make me hopeful. He mentioned he wanted to bring all Americans together and hopefully he will actually work toward that and not disappoint us. 
Stage 3: Bargaining
sad tbh, Im pretty sure bernie would have won if he got the chance
Don't let your memes be dreams. If you think this election inspired a lot of memes, I can't wait for 2020

Man I am so depressed right now and this has me cracking up. Thank you for this comment.
Please analyze the rise of populism within american and British societies, be sure to include the rise of the internet as an alternative to the 20th century vision-tubes and the impact the transition had. 
The Dems can filibuster everything for four years. That's really their only gambit.The alternative is to let them run the country undivided and see what happens. The downside for them is that 2018, which would ordinarily be a great year for them, does not have a favorable electoral map since they have to defend a lot of purple seats Obama won in 2012.
Hahaha, I was looking at this the whole time too! Feel really bad for Baron and Melania, being a political family took them by surprise.There was one point where he scrunched his whole face up because he was holding in a yawn!
It won't dawn on him for many years, probably, how insane that moment actually was for him.
Also got self-assisted suicide in CO, don't forget about that. 
No, no, not as part of that bet. Just as a general penance.
Except for Alec Baldwin, who's probably got the best job security in the world right now, probably better than Trump's
He is probably blazing it up right now
We call it the Berniestein universe and from what I hear you can get the full 5-season DVD box set of *Firefly* on Amazon.

Oooohhhh Jeeeeez
Bowie dead, Cubs win World Series, Donald Trump is honest to god president. This is a satire's idea of the future.
Poe's law is an Internet adage which states that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, parodies of extreme views will, to some readers, be indistinguishable from sincere expressions of the parodied views.
Holy shit, that's brilliant
I don't think anyone *Wanted* her, she just refused to let anyone else take her potential presidency.
Maybe Hillary Clinton can try her hand at Secreta -- oh wait.
This is exactly it. 
If we're going by stereotypes, I can also clean the hell out of a house so there's that. 
Hillary and snowden sharing an apartment in a repurposed office in the Kremlin. A sitcom I'd watch 
Florida, Arkansas, and North Dakota are all red states that voted for marijuana decriminaliztion but only for medical reasons. Only blue states voted for recreational marijuana. 
I can understand this in other countries where voting is mandatory, and people who don't want to vote are forced to. But actually going out of your way to go out, line up on a Tuesday evening and vote for a dead gorilla is some next level shitposting. 
Yeah it's lost it's believability to be honest. 
When he brought up Hillary, I was expecting bashing. Was pleasantly surprised and I sincerely hope he keeps that kind of tone in his presidency..
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

Except the Senate can change their rules and end the filibuster.
To be honest I think it took most of america by surprise. I'm really curious how the rest of the world that is on reddit will react to this.

On the other side, House of Cards and South Park are fucked.

Just end me then.
Damn, no thread is safe for Golden State.
Sometime last year we seem to have switched into a parallel universe
Uhh the DNC sure as shit wanted her
If Hillary had refused the job and stayed in the Senate, she would probably be president right now.
Hell six months ago some were saying the party was finished or would need to redefine itself. 
Ah, young love <3
Medical reasons to include: "Oh my God the President is such a dick, I need some weed."
Eh it's a vote of no confidence. I feel like it's saying I don't like anybody or I am not informed enough to vote so here's my vote anyway that I support the process but I don't believe I'm  being represented here.
I need a source on this please! My buddy was a huge Matt Hardy fan but doesn't watch anymore. He would love to see this.
Agreed, by all measures, that was a decent speech and a good starting tone hoping he can drop the 'crazy' act and act like a business mogul that is now fucking president of the U.S

Are you kidding ? South Park will have a great time criticising his every move. The only good part of it. House of Cards, I reckon they predicted Trump's last resort after 6 months of falling popularity and getting nothing done....start a war.

Right? Sanders was cheated out of the damn primary because the DNC definitely wanted Clinton.
I live in Wisconsin and I know multiple people that flipped from Hillary to Bernie because her lack of campaigning. Bernie had 3 rallies at my campus and Hillary had one private speech. They also did not end up voting for her today either
They likely voted for real on all the other choices. This wasn't the only thing to vote for. That's why it's common. Folk who don't agree at all with the options on that one but still care about the other votes speak out this way. 
He's actually having a bit of a career resurgence at the minute, too.
It's up to Americans to hold him to his good promises (term limits, dropping TPP, finance regulation etc) and make him drop his bad ones (wall, Muslim ban, immigrant roundup, global warming denial etc).
RemindMe! 4 Years
Dormammu I've come to bargain 
I can't help but feel like if Sanders had actually been given a fair shake he would be the president elect right now. The DNC really fucked up. 
Maybe that's why Trump won. He connected with the American people a lot. He went on talk shows like every morning, he had a rally like every night.I don't like him, but I hope a higher level of communication between the President and the people would be great.
Global warming denial is probably his worst 'promise', especially as he considers it a Chinese Hoax.

Yeah! Those are my favorite. I've always been a storyteller at heart, and I love jokes where you can memorize the set up and punchline and get from point a to point b in whatever  way you want. Shaggy dog stories are the best, and if you do it right people aren't pissed off that you just took 5 minutes to tell a joke that didn't have a real punchline.Are you from the southeastern US by chance? We also call them "shaggy dog stories" when folks in our family tell stories that have far too many details that aren't relevant. You know, "starts every story with Genesis."
Only except they don't remember, so you have to remind them, then you just end up dissecting and killing the joke in the end. At least, thats my experience.
This is why i hate telling jokes too, i'm socially retarded and even if they go along with it i'm very likely to punch up the fuck line.

A couple are driving through Wales and they pass through Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. They begin to argue over how to pronounce it and so they decide to ask a local.

It's the fluidic version of the lever. And no work is done while things remain static.So even though you can lift a car with a person (it's called a hydraulic jack, by the way!), you still exert the same total amount of energy doing so, whether you use a small amount of effort over a long period of time vs a huge amount of effort over a short period of time.

I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the southern colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities, especially in the southern colonies, could be most aptly described as agrarian pre-capitalist.

Though wetness may be even (same amount of fluid per volume, as most liquids are incompressible), going deeper into this thread and I can feel the potential (for puns) dropping, and the pressure (to perform) increasing. 
Of course that's your contention. You're a first-year grad student; you just got finished reading some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison probably. You're gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when you get to James Lemon. Then you're going to be talking about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year; you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.

I mean I guess she figured it out right?
Reminds me of my group projects in college.
This exact thing happened to our group in an escape room a few months ago.  I guess some of the people weren't listening in the beginning and missed that the box by the door was for our coats, purses, etc...So about 5 minutes into the escape room, someone in our group drags out a purse, dumps it on the floor, and proceeds to go though the wallet.  At one point, he says loudly "hey, this wallet has a lot of money in it" and we all turned and saw what he was doing, including the owner of the purse.  She was horrified.
York uni? 
> fire extinguisher on the wall that she was CERTAIN had to be for something. For an hour she wandered around aimlessly carrying a fire extinguisher. Mom sounds like she played a lot of early 1990s computer adventure games: USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON DOOR"That doesn't work that way."USE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON STAIRS"Nothing happens."
Take off clothes, get kicked out, room escaped. Winner!
"Sorry brenda, we can't all escape."
Nobody had ever tried which option? Because I probably wouldn't think to look across the street.Also wow, that's early for a bible study, but I guess there's a lot of material to go over.
Oh man. Imagine breaking up in a room you can't get out of, then having to work together to solve puzzles to get away from each other. Was it fun to watch? This will be the plot of a rom-com in 6 months
>oh that wasn't us we thought you put that in there.Nothing adds to the ambience of an escape room like actual human feces.
When I played, our train of logic  pointed to taking apart a hanging light. The people knocked on the door loudly and told us not to dismantle live electronics. 
"And next time, it won't just be the furniture we rearrange." (Cannot find the relevant Far Side comic - but that is what this reminded me of)
More of these places should have people fixing their own destructiveness afterwards (when they're breaking rules given to them prior) 
Wow and I thought the world was running out of heroes. 
And then you kept checking on them.
Not really for free if the company's selection process sucks that way.
Can't even tell those guys to get a room, they're already in one.

What the fuck. Did the actor lose his eye? 
"I shot the escape room operators and kicked the door open, i'm so cool"
I always imagine that the people observing are continuously make bets on what the people do.
Yeah that's always a bummer - It'll be two people, just the couple. Only the guy is completely freaking out the whole time about having to pop the question at the end, so, the girl ends up dragging the guy through the whole thing, doing all the work - Or, worse, we give them all the answers after an hour of standing around - All to reveal this ring at the perfect moment, only, that moment is completely ruined by this newfound perspective you have on your fiance, as this completely bumbling idiot who didn't solve one fucking puzzle the whole time 
And if you stick metal in electric sockets, you win on escaping life!
If it's a stupid idea and it works then it's not a stupid idea. 
there is money between the space of the door and the wood, they're supposed to combine it with other props in the room for the code to get out. 
A mind of the highest order.
There's always money in the banana stand
What was the obstacle? If it isn't supposed to be climbed over, it should be designed in a way where people don't think to climb over it. 
Not really. They were kinda dicks to begin with. They just tried to explain why they did nothing wrong, which sucks because there are plenty of awesome cops in my area, and we got the shitty ones 
Yeah I don't understand either, maybe I'm just missing something, but how do you plant a spy in the group like this?
now i'm imagining an episode of the office where michael brings everyone to an escape room

oh nooo I've fallen down! I hope the zombie doesn't come and... kiss me
I find that watching people attempt to escape the room is an excellent way to assess their teamwork, problem solving skills, demeanor under pressure, and general character in multiple ways. Your friend's boyfriend sounds like a jerk. I brought someone I had just started dating to room escape and watching them was a huge indicator of lots of aspects of their personality early on. 
Astonishing!
Imagine the mind place scene flashing.
It's a small pipe for smoking, usually weed, but traditionally tobacco. 
I was shocked at that point, the torture thing wasn't as bad because he said something dumb like: "Torture you from inside of the room while you're outside". But the "rotten child" part really got to me, haha.
Yeah it's super frustrating but also understandable, you've been working towards this point and when it's finally there it can feel as if it's not really "THE END".But there have been moments where I got into discussion about their logic behind not leaving.
Now that's thinking outside the box!
Might have been easier to clean if he didn't.

"It's for the greater good."
They told us later they didn't know what the hell we were doing, but didn't want to intervene. We eventually had to ask them if she was supposed to still be cuffed. I feel like they probably should've asked us about it, but eh, it made a good story! 
You can get out at anytime. There's usually a door that's not part of the puzzle. 
That would be IKEA, actually.
April:  This is my home now.
I think the idea is that the teammate on the phone sacrificed himself (turned into a chicken and couldn't talk) in order to deliver the hint involving acting like a chicken.
They're too weird for me.  It's even weirder since duck penises are corkscrew-shaped, so this is just a human penis pasted on a duck.  I imagine they float upright well with a rudder like that, though.
I work today I'll try to snag one
At an escape room we went to we started taking apart a photo frame with a "do not disassemble" sticker on it. They seemed quite annoyed but in fairness they also had "do not open" writing on a lot of things you had to open to solve the puzzle.
We only have minutes to harvest!
Oh shit and then each time you repair it, it probably looks more like it's a clue, so people rip it up again! 
I'm not sure. The escape room employee said that he was scared to enter the room to tell the guy to stop. If I'm remembering correctly, he was asked to leave
Yea that actually sounds like a legit step to solve the puzzle
Why was this knife here if I wasn't supposed to murder the rest of the group with it? 
Fallout Logic
So you're gonna try to tell the guy in the $4,000 dollar space suit how to solve an escape room? C'mon! 
Maybe he tells everyone they were the first...
Anyone who ever apologizes for the mess they made, made a tiny mess in comparison to the person who leaves without saying anything.
Why didn't you listen to them the first time?
they automatically refill if you try to do that without drinking them, DUH
From that one conversation I had with him, he seemed to lack a fair bit of common sense (who asks for the answers without playing?? Goodness...). I saw the guy again with his company some time later and he looked like he wasn't part of the crowd; everyone else seemed pretty chummy. Funny enough, he was pretty into the escape once he went in... My staff and I fondly shake our heads whenever we think back to him lol
Yup :/ that they in all fairness paid for.
I mean I wouldn't expect the type of people who fuck in an Escape Room to be courteous.
Yeah beer, must be a regional thing. Though a 30 rack of ribs would have also been a sight to behold.
She escaped with 7 seconds left, unmodified and with minimal help. 
One time I had a group of kind of redneck people come in and they all smelled funny. We assumed it was some weird pot and just got them in the room. One of the weirder gentlemen went outside in the middle of the game and came back in and released a large cloud of smoke into the room. After they failed to escape, we took their picture and the same guy screams "All right guys, let's go smoke some more meth!" We still don't have rules against this. 
If you played point and click games in the 90s you know those might actually be things you'd have to do in some of them!
It's pretty difficult to electrocute yourself with modern sockets. Not impossible but you have to try.
Her way was faster
The solution here is barbed wire.
I would guess it's the spy giving the mission to solve the puzzles in the room, (basically the game host) but it ends up being the spy all along.
That would have made a great episode
"Stanley, you escaped from life in 'da hood', we could really use you here"
That actually fucked a group I went with once, nobody checked the damn coat rack
You work in a button factory?
One chick rode naked through the streets on a horse
yeah I haven't gotten to them yet neither. onwards we go
When we finished I thought we were only 2 or so minutes off the top 5 board and I remember giving her a bit of a death stare. I was being a bit thick though and we were just under 9 minutes off so it wasn't that bad.
I bet that was annoying. We did another room with a group of friends and started off with the room really dark and only one flashlight. We are probably 85% of the way through and my friend made the comments about some lights in a box. Went to look and there was 4 torches in the first box that was opened she just didn't think to mention it.
Ha! I can only imagine this is the reason she is your ex mother in law.
But now he's added legitimacy to the prop.
Found a clue!
"Honey, I rented a boat for our honeymoon."
Definitely smart to look at the books! But they are REAL published books, they have page numbers and words. If you need to use them you will probably have a clue/colormarker/hints.  No escape room should make you look through 10+ books blindly.
Reality has never stood in the way of a rom-com plot before.
IKEA is the ultimate escape room. 
We've had around 3 proposals in the escape rooms so far. The first one was really nice. The guy met us weeks beforehand and asked us to personalize our prettiest escape room. All the clues were about their relationship like where they first met, first kiss, etc and at the end of it all, was the ring.The second was shitty. We were not informed at all. The girl was chained and blindfolded in a small, black box room. No idea why he thought that would be a good place to propose.The third was hello kitty- themed. I just heard about it from my coworkers but w h y
See I would have assumed I was supposed to decapitate the chicken
So you'll fuck a rubber duck, but only if it's a female rubber duck? 
Well that's their fault really. 
Thank you Mister Snute, we'll be in touch 
Yes! After a group ripped up floorboards in one room the next couple groups saw the misalignment from our repairs and assumed it was a trap door. We had to add 'don't remove the flooring' to our briefing.
So you're saying that cutting up the carpet with a pocket knife *was* the key to escaping the room?!
He's the only one who survives when they complete the puzzle and the whole station rapidly depressurizes.
The key is inside them!

It's part of a larger company wide competition between branches. Near the beginning of the episode, Dwight openly suggests tying up the escape room attendant and torturing him for the information. The camera would then pan quickly over to a slightly nervous looking teenage boy and then back to Michael who briefly ponders it before telling Dwight to get serious.
wasn't she also made of chocolate?
Can confirm, I was the radiator.
I keep forgetting I chose that name...
my thoughts exactly
It's a control thing! 
The next guy will have an excuse. "Well it *smelled* like a real toilet."
How did you end up in the utility room twice?
I made an escape room based on Viking history set in a college, and I put in some books about the vikings for decoration. Someone used them as a shortcut on a combination lock (which a clue hinted to be the year the vikings invaded England). I didn't mind them doing that because they showed ingenuity and didn't just look it up on their phone.
There needs to be a movie where people go to an escape room then an actual disaster happens and shit gets really real. Could be a romcom or a thriller or both.
The first one is actually genius
Friday's would be perfect. If she says yes you can celebrate with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. If she rejects you then you can wallow in self pity with endless cheese sticks and potato skins. It's a classic win/win scenario 
Ya when op brought up sacrifice I was thinking 'no way is she about to do decapitate her friend
It was a male duck.  Why *wouldn't* it have a dick?
I don't fuck my duckies, it destroys them after a couple years and I don't want to ruin all the good ones I have left.
Haha yeah I can completely see that. I think out of all of them, Phyllis would actually be the only one to sit down and solve the puzzle first, even though Stanley could have solved it faster if he wasn't doing his damn crossword!
What a genius
'But *could* I?' he wondered,  'and *should* I?' he thought -  'It's present,' he pondered,  'and *surely* I ought?  It's *clearly* included,  and *why* would it be -  If not with a purpose intended for me?'Perhaps it's a pointer?  Perhaps it's a clue?  I'll *never* be sure,  But I'll know when I do!  I'll do it!' he whispered,  'I'll do it!' he cried.  He sat in his suit and he watched as they died.&nbsp;^^^:)
Put a polarized screen on the wall, then put a filter on the helmet that lets you see through the polarization.

As much as I wanted to record it I can't ! But it would've been great for pornhub. Definitely would almost be black couch worthy. 
I was running a room with a secret room inside of it and the group had to get a key off the wall inside the secret room. We have something inside another box for you to get to it, but this older dude, may have been 60, pulls off his belt, holding up his pants with his hands and whips that key off the wall like Indiana Jones. Like I mean he whacked it off the wall and into his had. It was amazing to watch, but he still didn't get out. 
Monkey Island! :) Thanks! Good old days. is it available on pc anymore? my original cds wont run :(
She just clipped through the wall to skip the 'escape room' sidequest.
Can't get blood from a stone.  Sometimes these groups are awesome.  The kids have an epiphany.  Not that it changes lives but it gives them a clue.  Most of the time it's just what you would expect.  I get crap for it.  "Condemn them to failure!"  I say bullshit why is it fair to enabling their leeching behaviors?  
/r/RedditWritesTheOffice 
In some way or another for a reason I don't know why, this reminds me of the "game/competition" where you go door-to-door starting with a dollar store item, and get people to trade you for equal or more value if they want it. You see who ends up with the best item at the end of the day.Some people start with a toothbrush and end up with a piano or TV.
You certainly wouldn't be in any danger. 
Going out on a limb here. But I'll guess alcohol played a part. 
The second one might be making the best of a bad situation.
Yeah, OP that sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. You sure that's a public attraction you're working at and not a BDSM meetup?
We went to one based on the saw movies where we were all chained to the walls/ chairs and blindfolded. Some of us had a little play in our chains.  So there would be a clue near one person, who would call it out and it would allow someone else to open a padlock or locked combination box to get keys. It was exciting.

At some point we get a camera pan to Creed standing in the corner of the room visibly sweating. He points to the camera above him.  "I did something like this in Kyoto for a lot of money a few years ago. Let me know if anybody brings in chili peppers."
It's like when Dwight traded for the magic beans. 
The third one sounds like something my fiance would like. For some reason she absolutely loves hello kitty. I dont get it, but if I get her something hello kitty themed, it makes her smile, so thats more than enough incentive for me.
Are you going to hurt women?
I've been to one called the kidnapping. They go over everything with you quite extensively. The blindfolds are sleep masks that you can opt out of wearing. The chains connect with those easy open lobster claw clap things, and you can unclip yourself if you need to. 
Also the same place also has a game where you start all locked in a prison cell. You have to pass a cup of water between 3 cells to get the keys to float up to the top of a nearby bucket and use a broom handle to hook them into your cell to escape. You're then loose in an even bigger cell which you also need to escape to get into the main room. 
1. Yes2. I've been sleeping with your       brother 3. It seemed like he thought the body pillow responded positively.

Yeah people are clever and think these rooms are built for geniuses so they need to Sherlock the hell out of it. Whatever rule you come up with someone *will* find a way to interpret it to mean there's a clue involved. Which is part of why a lot of them have monitors and speakers, so the employees can tell you to knock it off if you've decided you need to dismantle the heating pipe to get a key out of it

Its sort of a "choose your own adventure" racist joke.  Which ever race you wish to insult, you just need to know what their stereotypical food of choice is.  
But with the help of God and these two fingers, I saved them all!
How did I get here?
this is the part I actually laughed at
That's when you say.."shit, now I have to start again"

You're right. I did not do a good job of textualizing an Irish accent.

That is one of my favourite jokes. Two bats are hanging from a beam. A third bat is sat on top. The one underneath says to the other one, "What's she doing up there?" The other one says, "Yoga."

Where did the hipster drown?In the main stream.
If you get the main gist of it down, you can ad lib everything else on the spot, which is mostly quotes of whatever they are doing when they meet, followed by the boss being skeptical. In 100 years nobody will actually know who Tom Cruise is. They will know Dave, however.Introduce Dave & Boss  Meet Tom Cruise  Meet President Obama  Dave meets the Pope & returns  Boss's Heart Attack  Punchline from unknown person
Reminds me of the Purple Polka Dotted ping pong ball joke. 
It's both a joke and a shitty brain teaser for job interviews.
Good day to be the first mathematician.
I... don't get it. :(
If I can help someone drop a deuce, its been a good day.
I know right!? The others were good, this was incredible.
A woman walks into a bar. She says to the bartender 'I'd like a double entendre please'. So he gives it to her. 
Should have linked it to /u/me for extra confusion.
Why do birds fly south for the winter?Cause it's too far to walk
This is the first time I've ever seen anyone besides my husband tell this joke. He saves it for when ducks or geese are actually flying overhead. On at least one occasion, he started laughing too hard to finish the joke because he knew how poorly the guy he was telling it to was going to react. That was awesome!
What an amazing place.Edit after some browsing: What a horrible place...
ME! always.

Squirrel is hanging out in a pine tree, chewing on a pinecone. Suddenly the tree starts shaking like crazy, so he looks to see what the commotion is all about. Lo and behold, elephant is clumsily climbing his way up."What are you doing up here?" asks squirrel."Oh, I just felt like climbing up here to eat some pears," replies elephant."Stupid elephant... this is a pine tree, there are no pears here.""It's ok, I brought my own pears."
About 70% less than male ones.

A string walks in to a bar and the bartender says "we don't serve your kind here.""Well, what kind is that?" "String. We don't serve string. Aren't you a string?""No sir, I'm a frayed knot." * Boooooooo!! Hisssssss!! *

Well how many of them were there!?
It's funnier if you think that the dog doesn't need a tree to pee because he's a dog, he can go where ever. The joke is he's holding his pee for no reason, or that his dog logic thinks he can't pee unless there's a tree.Or if you refer to a couple getting lost driving somewhere and one says they'll pee their pants if they don't find a bathroom soon. It's funny to think dogs share that experience.
Narcoleptic rage
What did the leper say to the prostitute?   Keep the tip.
The follow up to The Young Pope. 
Because of Jude Law?

I wasn't implying that it would be difficult to remember the specific sequence of events, just that I'm going to want to recall that this joke exists when the time comes that I want to tell a joke.
You know the ping pong ball one?...Last summer I was on vacation visiting New Hampshire. I went to a concert with a group of friends and on the way back the guy driving starts with the ping pong ball story. He lines it up so it fills up the entire 25 minutes to get back to where we were staying. 25 minutes.
Or the second one, since he has first crack at the second pint.
I have been laughing at this for over an hour now 
I even laughed at the explanation.
 I know nothing of Australia.  But I know Karl. 
It was such a Michael Scott thing to do

In college a prof told a story of giving a speech to korean dignitaries, and he told a joke that had them dying from laughter. After his talk he asked the interpreter why they found it so amusing and he said that it wouldn't have translated well so he just told them the speaker has made a very funny joke.
You know how birds fly in the big V's and sometimes one side will be longer than the other? You know why that is?  It's because there's more birds on that side.

Captain Redbeard walks into a bar. The bartender asks, "Redbeard, where's your buccaneers?   Redbeard replies, 'Under me buccan hat'.(if you want to see all the jokes I've posted in here, click on my username.)
What the fuck is this site
I like it better as a anti-joke where it's just a deadpan "I'm eighty" with no pirate voice.   
I've heard it like this '..... we don't serve your kind here. So the rope walks out the door and ties himself in a knot and ravels his ends a little bit and walks back in. The barkeep says hey aren't you the rope that was just in here? And the rope says nope, I'm a frayed knot.'
Absolutelynotme_irl
Fook sounds more English to me. Feck is Irish and fouck is perhaps more accurate to what a Scottish "fuck" sounds like
I dodged that shit like the matrix.
Also, dogs don't wear pants. 
That's awful.funny tho
The Black Pope.I'd watch it, but only if it stars Samuel L.
Well... we have a lot of sword fighting bare men
You should know the joke by heart because you know Dave.
I honestly like the first one more because of the build up between the three guys. I was thinking there must be an ulterior motive for the arm wishes but they already head me cracking up. Then he walks into the bar, arms flailing and head nodding - I'm cracking up even harder. "I think I fucked up". Fucking got me good. Me and my friends say that when we're doing dumb shit so it hit home. 
oh man the money i would pay to see that meeting
And then the wheeze laughing afterwards. Lmao you're so right.
> /r/longstabbythingWent there and the subreddit rules said first timers had to post.Now I feel like I have to make a commitment.
Absolutelynotme_irl who?
Oh shit they don't hahahaha
It will actually be starring Eddie Murphy as both the pope, his wife and his mother. It will be hilarious, I guarantee. 
Are you the representative for the entire internet? I knew I'd get to meet you one day!
Really... if they wrote a 10 page poem for this joke I would not feel frustrated by the end.

This joke's a mess
Fucking hipsters, what with their shirts and pants.
I am not very cool (long story; very overprotective parents + orchestra-nerd-turned-science-geek-turned-medical-student) and had to google this reference... THIS SONG IS FANTASTIC AND THE FOO FIGHTERS ARE FANTASTIC WHERE HAS THIS SHIT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!??
I feel like my life just found its purpose. That was to lead you to the Foo Fighters music.  I will tell this story to my children. 
All his life he was searching for something  Something never comes never leads to nothing  Nothing satisfies but he's getting close  When manly_lumber jack said "Watch him as he goes!"
Blinded by love I guess 
What a good noodle <3
I had good friend, when I was in primary school who had a step dad I really couldn't stand. He was quite a bit older than her mom and very strict. I even avoided to go to her place, when he was there. Later she told me that he beat her and her brother quite regularly.
"Maybe it's because he was a 35 year old man who wore visors."Funniest thing I've read this year
The amount of pedophile stories in this thread is freaking me out.
I like to think she actually said "Wang_Dipthong"
>Took 10 years but i was right.Nice :)>He is currently on year 1 of a 32 year sentence for repeated rape of his daughter.  :(
Did you divorce your husband after that?
So he walked into the shower with a bunch of naked girls? And no one else thought it was strange?
Yo momma so fat, she survived and lives a happy life!
Your grandma sounds awesome. Leaping over furniture and escaping from a murderer. 
I want to meet your sister and find out about myself.
The assistant pastor at my parents church always gave me the creeps, couldn't quite place my finger on it since he never did anything particularly creepy, he just looked like he had something to hide. A few years later, he was arrested for upskirting young girls at the mall. No telling what else he was doing too. This was a decade ago, dunno if counseling worked for him or anything but I haven't seen him pop up on the news at all. 
It's not often you hear about people still having contact with their first girlfriends - at least, I know more stories in which people don't stay in contact rather than they do. May I ask, how much time is in between you and her breaking up, and them getting married? It may be a bit of an offtopic question in this topic but I'm genuinely interested. 
My sister's class at school had a competition to write to him to get on to his Jim'll Fix It show. She was picked, and she really really wanted to do the thing she wrote about. But she completely refused to go to the show because she said he was creepy. She got in a tonne of trouble at school because of it, but I guess that was better than what could have happened. 
This sounds like high school. Please be high school.
Do you work in Gary, Indiana?
I hate that I know who you're talking about. 
I dated a guy that everyone thought was the greatest, and by all accounts, seemed to be. But my kids really didn't like him and my brother described him "as super mild mannered but the kind of guy that comes home one day and just murders his entire family" The relationship didn't last because of these reasons as well as my own but, as of 2 years, he's still just a great guy as far as everyone knows. Now it has me thinking. 
Oh!  Nonono, she died from stress during a move. :( 
Not for that caper, but I think he got popped for something else.  And I got a phone call a few months later from an angry ex-girlfriend telling me my suspicions were correct and which pawn shop he used.  The police were just like, "Meh."
To be fair, it's not a thread about people who gave a good first impression and later turned out to have an exemplary character.
She did. It's a family name. The first wang_dipthong was my great great great grandmother. She was the biggest wang alive at the time. Now there are only two wangs left - mom and I. Mom remarried and her name is Wang Stroker now. I'm the hardest Wang because I haven't found love yet. Hopefully one day, I'll be a softer wang. 
Thanks for offering a ride, but I think I'll just ~~walk~~run...
This about sums it up
Not yet.  Complicated, lengthy, messy, and almost entirely on Reddit (see feed)
Yes! There is a saying "she was thought to be crazy by the man who drove her there". So true. Or woman. I guess
For real.  That's sick and manipulative.
I sometimes think my life story could have been a fantastic book for Oprah's book club.Maybe this is why I hate things like that and prefer humor? Sometimes dark, sometimes with cream and sugar.
This reminds me of our close family friends - father had been molesting his daughter for years and his wife (my mum's best friend) treated her like the *other woman* in an affair.
Yes, Dave sucks. But I, too, would like to know more about this avocado ranch. Specifically why it's not a farm, but a ranch. Also the avocados. 
The avocado farm was a hotbed of drama and passion, but that's avocado farms for ya.
It was fucking horrific.  We knew something wasn't right with him but we had nothing other than our gut feelings and some creepy looks he gave some little girls.   And of course everyone else in the family just loved him so we looked like assholes for refusing to associate with him.   Even after his conviction people in the family are still making excuses for what he did and trying to tell people that what he did wasn't really that bad.   My husband doesn't talk to that side of the family anymore.  
Right? How's she going to afford the rent without a roommate??
From own experience: it never goes well, and the person who tried to warn the others becomes a cynical bastard because of it. 
Wanna come over for waffles? Maybe it'll make your day better :)
Why not just get a divorce, holy fuck. 
I guess some did, I'm still friends with a girl, that also went there and she left the club for the same reason I did. I think they were either too embarassed to tell or they really didn't think of it as strange. As I said, he was loved by everyone, he also was teacher at my elemantary school. People trusted him. 
It was a legit reason for him to enter the showers and us being seven years olds somehow liked the idea of having a snowball fight...
/r/wholesomeyomommajokes
The great country of Nonobia resents that comment.
Yean. Not quite as good as before, but a lot of that was me moving across the country for school and her wanting to stay close to home.
"when you look at someone with rose colored glasses, all the red flags are just flags"
She's in better shape than anyone I know, that's for sure! XD
I'm gonna assume that it was a knife behind his back  and the last sentence does say the cops were called
I think he was lonely and heartbroken. She was like this dream come true for him. She pretended to be into everything he was into, even though I could tell that bitch didn't like animals. If you like animals you don't look like your playing freeze tags when one accidentally brushes up against you.Was he wrong? Absolutely.Can I understand WHY he allowed himself to be fooled? Yup.
100% totally agree. Not even a question. It took a lot for his mother to even speak to him again.
Yep, and then to keep up with the lie (since he actually was just working there) he had to build more lies about going back to the store to work there. And then build another lie about how he's also rich from the stock market to explain the income he was getting from stealing and eBay sales.
I think if you spend time worrying that you might be secretly bad, you're probably not too bad.
Don't give her any Jet.
Unfortunately where i lived (when this happened), these things won't be taken seriously by the police.. 
Childhood sexual abuse is a manipulative thing. It's not uncommon for abused folks to remain in an abusive situation, sometimes their whole lives, say if their abuser is also their brother.
This is the kind of content I want on r/nosleep Not some shit like *My Uncles PortaPotty is Haunted part 1719*Even though this is real, and not for the purpose of being scary, its so much more intense and enjoyable to read. 
Not only did I trust my gut, I also drew dicks on his car when I could find it in the parking lot.
It did indeed. But this was some years after I'd graduated, so I didn't really have any reason to argue the case again with anybody.
Don't remember her name, unfortunately. My parents were really good about not being dismissive when I was a kid.
Her other guy came to see her one day and she told my brother that he was an old coworker. So my brother said he'd take them all out to lunch and she lost her shit, and it all unraveled. She admitted to everything, from using my brother for money to having this whole relationship for their entire relationship. 
I know a Bulgarian girl doing this. Shes attractive and has a good job, and is married to an English guy, but has a 'soul mate' in Bulgaria. She also goes on dates with other guys, as long as they're rich or really handsome. It's weird, because all her Bulgarian girlfriends think she's perfectly entitled to do this, and being married doesn't take her off the market, while her husband is in total denial and thinks she's just friendly with other guys. 
Oh absolutely. I felt awful for him. But I wanted to hire a sky writer to tell her to fuck off haha 
I used to get people to pull their own harness up, and would show them how to close the buckles. When it came time to thread the rope through the loops, there was a good 5-6 inches of rope between my hand and the harness. Can't be too careful.Speaking of careful, I always double and triple checked harnesses, both to make sure they were tight enough and that they were properly done up.
Same here, turns out the dog had secretly been evil etc
They're good fluffy domestic assault detectors, Brent
Dogs always know dude.  Just turn yourself in to the police now and save everyone the trouble.
i finally understand why in english class they say to define pronouns
I like to recommend this book as well, particularly for women, we are socially trained to be nice even when our inner alarms are blaring.
Yeah, turns out some pensioner in the pub I drink in was a prolific pedophile, it turns out he was at it for decades, generally against very vulnerable people; disabled children etc, basically the worst you can get. What was horrific is that he was reasonably normal, you expect these people to be monsters, the idea that they're walking amongst you is the scary part. 
Good ole' Gary. Make sure you gas up before you get there. You don't want to stop. 
Don't know, but he was sharing with the roofing crew he was working with.
No, she sat in the library for years 
Username checks out. History shows posts about Africa. I'm almost 99% sure OP is really Oscar Pistorius and is just trying to be relevant again. 
 Indeed, Johannesburg born and raised! Okay, so to be fair, please don't take my story as a full and complete portrayl of his character. After all, we were just teenagers at a house party - I'd hate to be judged for who I was at 17. Maybe he tried his best to be a better person in the following years. My story just tied in perfectly with the question so decided to stop lurking for once and contribute..... it's been cathartic. 
You and me both. Obviously I never would have pegged him for being that fucked up, but I didn't like him from the beginning. Not only for his karmawhore ways, but just the way he acted and talked seemed off to me. 
An investment to the betterment of humanity. 
Yup, my boyfriend was like "she probably just cheated" but me and my guy friend I guess were being nice and giving the benefit of the doubt.
People like that are the minority, but they're the ones that stick in people's brains and turn our whole society to think "men can't like playing with kids or they're pervs".
Try being a *dad* without your wife present at all times. I've had to defend myself from strangers accusing me of pedo intentions towards my own children on the playground. Though to be fair, this is more a statement on the sorts of people that would attack somebody they simply assume is a predator, than society itself - which seems to have more and more of those people in it anyways.
Lol, that part is straight cold. "Oh, you found out I was cheating on you? I'm afraid I'll have to break up with you!" 
snek was avenged <3
Somebody should make that thread
Sometimes I wonder if I'm a narcissist, as I have been called one in fights before and I can go all scorched-earth, but I try to keep my ego in check by questioning myself. I feel like if I let myself go unchecked I could become one especially because I'm not perfect and make mistakes. Also when I go scorched-earth it tends to be in defense of someone I love
Good luck. We are on Team AllysWorld. 
Do it. Write the book 
Do you want rampages?Because this is how you get rampages. I hate hearing shit like this so much. THESE ARE YOUR FUCKING KIDS MAN. FUCKING DO THE RIGHT THING. OR DON'T HAVE KIDS. 
Sole manager of said Ranch here! You see, in order to become a farm, we need a proper set of investors backing us. With your help, we can put this Ranch phase behind us, and become a true Avocado farm once and for all! I'll take you for a tour sometime.
That does make me wonder though, if they already signed a lease together shouldn't he still be liable for his half of the rent?I mean I don't know if I would push it to far and sue someone crazy like, that but if you got his half plus get another roommate BOOM free rent!
Don't let it get to you.  Sometimes you cannot fix stupid.  You saw the problem when nobody else could.  That is a very important skill.  Keep your eyes open man!
My gut instinct says no
He wanted the insurance money and didn't want to lose custody of his 3 year old. Source: the article.
I'm thinking it was a not-subtle message from the judge. The number I wish was wrong is how many times the high-school girl stabbed her foster mother; why (and how, honestly) would you stab anyone 178 times?  I couldn't even imagine stabbing Hitler 178 times.  (I mean, the father may have talked her into killing the woman, but there's something *very, very* wrong with a person who murders someone with that much overkill. (Beyond being a murderer, that is.)  That's like, almost *beyond* psychopathy. 
Yeah, that's usually the story.  This is how they get to the position of trust they need to get what they want.  Everyone is always so surprised.  It's almost never the guy with the weird mustache.  You'd never let him near your kids, so how would looking the part help?
That in itself is creepy.  Just the snowball thing... Yuck. 
Hey wait a minute!  You're not OP!
I think they did but just did not expect it from their prized employee
Reminds me of my favorite Mark Twain quote: "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything." I don't know how people have the energy to keep up an elaborate web of lies.  I've lived by this for many years, and it has made life pretty easy, bitching even.  
I say the same thing to parents, if you spend your time worried that you're a bad parent, you're probably not. Bad parents don't give a shit. 
Ugh. That's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Denial is a powerful thing
I chuckled at this. Love it. My favorite meme is the one where someone asks Michelangelo to do the Sistine Chapel & he's all "ya but I'm gonna draw a bunch of dicks on it though" 
That's so awesome. That's the kind of parent I want to be someday. 
Kids can be super honest sometimes. Other times my daughters tell me about all the dinosaurs they hunted and killed and the caves they live in where they festooned the walls with the dinosaur intestines. Idk whats real or not real anymore.
My Asian mom did stuff that other people could take as being creepy. She loves babies and would want to hold them. Then she would say something like "oh he/she's so pretty. Can I take him/her home". Obviously she wasn't serious.
My Asian mom has also done some things that would freak out Americans. Once on a road trip we were getting ready to leave a ratty motel/apartments in a hick town, mom sees one of the live-in children watching her eat cookies. She has the kid come into our van to eat cookies with her. Needless to say when I came upon the scene I quickly explained in non-English why this shit could get her in some big trouble, this isn't Asia, get that kid the fuck out of the van before someone sees. 
So she is dead now? 
Do you happen to know if this is common among Bulgarians? Or just a one off thing 
If anyone ever said they knew how to do it themselves I'd let them, but I would always always always double check the harness and make sure they were clipped properly. After every attempt too. When it comes to safety, it takes A LOT to be "too careful."
Yeah I was imagining this dog setting up op. "oh really? The dog shit in the living room? The dog we all love?""I SWEAR, WTF, WHY WOULD I SHIT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM?""Get the hell out of my house you freak "
In the original story for "Minority Report," Philip K. Dick actually had "predogs" instead of "precogs" but Steven Spielberg felt this would be too realistic, and detract from the scifi element. 
I feel like there's a new person with each pronoun. 
Awww what a good pup! I never had a dog escort me, but my friend's dog would always randomly show up on my back porch, demand to come inside to sniff and then leave. 
It's a tradition in our family to give a copy of this book to every girl graduating from high school. Really, everyone should read it, though.
That's what I was thinking. I don't get how it's possible to do that kind of thing and keep parental rights. Especially since she said he had a daughter. 
> generally against very vulnerable peopleThis is important to remember. The poor, the disabled, the shy, the lonely...serial abusers learn who to hurt.
Seems like its always the ones obsessing from the pulpit about homosexuality that turn out to be cock crazy.  
I've noticed micro facial expressions in myself during times of conflict and stress. Random muscles twitching or a darting eye or things like that
You know you're entering Gary when it's 100 degrees outside and all of the car windows start rolling up.
Ah, grad school
You're just not the girl for me...
OP - Oscar Pistorius. I see what you did there!And I like it. 
You and your friend are decent people, it sounds like this was the beginning of the crazy and you weren't to know. Glad your friend got out of it. 
If you really want to creep them out, hate kids *and* football.
I had my infant son out shopping at Staples with my wife's Guncle and a random lady literally tried to take the baby out of his arms because a baby that young "must have a mother" and we clearly stole him. It was insane. She went from, "aww, cute baby" to "I'm saving him from you perverted gay kidnappers" in 5 seconds flat. Thankfully store management escorted her out.
That's what my friend "Denise" is like. She was absolutely polite the first day I met her in work and all I really thought of her was that she seemed sweet. Well it turns out that she's the absolutely nicest person in the world. My friend "Lisa" met Denise at my birthday party and was shocked at the fact that I hadn't been exaggerating about how nice Denise was. I've literally been sat next to Denise going "aw man I'd love some chocolate right now" and she has offered me money so I could get some. And she wouldn't expect me to pay her back. I love her. 
Constant vigilance!
I dunno man. I make pretty killer waffles
what kind of confused brain thinks like, hmm I really love my daughter I want to be a part of her life. Divorce will likely fuck me over. What's the solution...oh I know, murder her mother! 
Yeah fuck snowballs. Snowballs are fucking pedophiles man.
This is not a standard thing in the US or Canada at least. Group showers for seven year olds supervised only by a male coach?Also the post said he got in trouble after assault at a training camp for younger girls. Do 5 year olds have "training camps"? Maybe this is in a country with a different sports system or something? Seems possible as handball is not so popular in North America.
It really says a lot about the owners. Good on them.
It still doesn't check out. First time something goes missing at night you have your security system improved. Most people don't sit there and go "oh darn it, an electric piano disappeared again" and then forget about it.
Coming from a guy who told people his name was Mark Twain
Thank you :) It's all good now, this happened almost 12 yrs ago and I've moved to another country since:) 
I think variations definitely translate fine/exist in English.  "Oh you're such a good kid, I should take you home/adopt you myself!"  Or even naughty children, "if you don't stop acting up, your mom will leave you with me and I'll put you to work!"  But there's definitely a tone people say it with that makes it obvious.  The "not taking no for an answer" is what puts the situation into creepy territory. 
And now some kid is out there persuading all the other kids that getting into a van really does result in free cookies. Nice going, Asian Mom. 
No, she's actually completely single. Apparently other dude didn't know she had been dating my brother, so when he found out he kicked her to the curb. 
I know couple of Bulgarian girls and they're nothing like this Might be it's just that group. 
Right, but in your area, how many "white van" incidents have there been, versus the amount of familial child abuse? Your fear is misproportioned, because your bias tells you that the people in *your* life wouldn't do something like that.
Feels like graduation from middle school would be the more appropriate age for this. High schools girls get trapped in a lot of shit because they don't know how to stop someone without being "rude." (Personal experience.)
As the father of a severely autistic girl, this scares the shit out of me. I know if someone took advantage of her I would kill them. How do you protect a 7 year old who can't even tell you she's hungry, or needs to go to the bathroom. This is a terrible thread to start my day.
That is so fucked up. How does someone do that to their own children (well, any child)? What a monster.
A lot of preachers tend to do sermons on the things they struggle with more frequently. It's easier to talk about something you personally have an issue with than something you don't.
It's the only thing that makes sense.Omama bin Laden?
I know it might be wrong
I fucking lost it at "perverted gay kidnappers".
*reads username*
No, kids are...
I think it depends on how often they check their inventory. Do they count their items in stock every day, once a week/month? By the time they checked, several items could've been taken over a period of days/weeks. As an insider, he knew their system and worked around it. 
I work with the kids that have shit like this happen to them, and I gotta say, I agree with you 100%.
Did your brother start dating the other guy?
can confirm, dated a Bulgarian girl for a while, can't confirm whether or not she put a curse on me when it ended though.
Holy shit. The coherent sentence shows the darker meaning...
Well also abuse from family is way more taboo and kept hush hush so you would never really hear about it. 
When reading stuff like this it is important to remember how the over-whelming majority of humanity would never harm your daughter. A lot of us would die before harming a child.
I used to work at a rape crisis center.  One of the staff had a FIL who had raped his wife, all his daughters, all his DILs, all his granddaughters and god knows who else. She finally put her foot down and made their family be no contact.  But no one ever stopped him.  It can totally be generational.  Which makes me want to puke.
More like Yomama bin Laden. 
I'm in love with Stacy's Mom
Work in a store, and now count our inventory every monday. But before we did it 2 times a year. You could have stolen a shit ton of products in that time, but once you do inventory, you finally realize how much you're missing.
I was actually gonna say or beat him to a pulp lol. But I don't want anyone being done for randomly fucking up a bad man with no actual evidence on what he did.
Though that would have been the best conclusion to bring this all full circle, no. 
Not that I know of. My brother moved five hours away shortly after that so I doubt it. 
> DILsHer raped his daughters-in-law?!? And his adult married sons reacted how? O.o
What do I have to do with any of this
She's got it going on
I have a friend that works for a professional inventory counting service.  They go to huge warehouses to count inventory and have these weird hip mounted computers they use to count and keep track of stuff.  When I knew him in high school he could barely do math but now he has Rainman level skill at counting a group of matched items close together.  
Yeah mob mentality can be a lovely thing... I feel bad for all the innocent older men who look like Elvis and sing like him in Australian bars.
Best thing about being full circle is that you're never straight.
so your brother is 2 hours away from that guy?
Quite possible he was a high authority figure within the family that noone dared to question
As someone who is socially awkward to a borderline debilitating extent, thank you. If I'd have learned people skills young I wouldnt have to put so much effort into it now that I'm 21.
Schools should just make kids who are bad at math do inventory.
If it helps he has a kiwi accent.
I sucked at multiplication tables all through school. Got a stock room job after graduating with a masters. Knew my multiplication tables up to 16 in three months. 
Wow what a fruit.
That's a really compassionate way of seeing the North Korea situation
Have parents who grew up in Korea, I'd definitely say that they have more resentment towards Japan than NK. I'd have to ask them, but they seem to be more sympathetic towards NK, especially since many have relatives there. 
It is due to the isolation and difference in North Korean language and culture in comparison to the South I believe.60 Years of total separation has its affects.
It's heart wrenching to think about. I'm sure many people just kept waiting and hoping for unification...going to their own death never knowing what happened to a parent, child, or spouse.
Yea my parents' generation, they used to have regular evacuation drills and stuff. But they do not Reddit. 
I think most Koreans want reunification-- I, as a Korean-American do.  I'm afraid that that the only way that will happen is via a war where tens of millions die.
You should make your own post with this question. I'd be interested in reading the responses. 
yeah this is what I wanted to ask. Can't imagine that there were actually children receiving these letters, NK government probably wouldn't allow it.
That is an incredible compliment, thank you. I did work in the translation industry for quite a while, so that may definitely helped. I also go on reddit on a daily basis, and read/watch a ton of English based media.
There is a documentary called A State of Mind that focuses on the Mass Games in North Korea. I watched it several years ago and it was really insightful and showed how they push the value of group dynamics over individual achievement. 
Not OP, but what you say regarding the impracticality of reunification is correct. However, the ideal is for reunification; it's just no one has any concrete ideas for this nor do we agree on a lot of things regarding NK.Sympathy for the people is supposed to be a given, so that one day if reunification does happen, we can be ready for it. As OP mentions, the NK regime and military are the taught as the "main enemy/adversary". This is an acknowledgement of that the threat that is NK yet that we must not be confused with "regime/military" and "people".
They probably didn't want to tell children anything worse. 
People forget that South Korea was once a fascist dictatorship.
The popular choices were the US, Canada, and Australia. 
For younger generations, the consensus is to stay where they are now. SK people sacrificed a lot to get to where they are economically and does not want to lose their sons/brothers/fathers to war.My perspective is that the country must be united once again. Depends on what party takes over the government. If liberal, peaceful merge. If conservative, hit me and we will hit you back harder. However, both parties have aims to reunite. Just different methods
Well, we had to watch the videos of those kids and we felt bad for them. It hits you hard when kids who look like you and speaks the same language dies off from starvation
That's adorable. :)
They did, but not the people. Implication was that NK people are just "hypnotized" by communism ideology and needs to be save.
May be we are related?
Among Korean youth it's more apathetic than hateful. Source: Am Korean with youthful Korean friends 
Its not a taboo topic to talk about or anything. Its comes up just like any other political comment.
Yeah, they were built with the idea of doubling as bunkers/shelters in mind.
which part of Seoul were you visiting? I find it hard to believe people were visibly uncomfortable with someone speaking Japanese, there are Japanese tourists everywhere.
I know! My grandpa didn't even recognize his little brother :( I'm pretty sure my grandpa abandoned his family when he joined the SK army with his best friend. He was a great grandpa but generally a pretty shitty person. His little brother is still alive and awesome! Eerily lives sorta close to the DMZ. 
Often in South Korea, North Koreans face social isolation and discrimination
She didn't trust it. Said something about not being regulated or something
You can visit through a tour group and everything is very restricted 
No. Probably from the Chinese character for the U.S. which means "beautiful" and is pronounced "Mei" in Chinese. Same character is likely pronounced "Mi" in Korean. 
My father in law recently visited from South Korea and we watched that show together.  Basically it is a Korean style talk show where professional South Korean hosts interview defectors about their life and experiences.  Since North Korea sucks so bad, it might come across as propaganda but it does not seem to have a script.  You can watch the most recent episodes on ondemandkorea.com but there are no subtitles.
I would be drunk any time I was awake.
I mean Korea transformed so completely during their lives, can I ask how they talk about this transformation and how the country was under the elder Park, or how they use industrial tools that they might not have had as children if they were especially poor?
I could potentially see a coup of sympathetic North Koreans finally overthrowing them.
Not to mention the fact that, you know, he's committed war crimes and will probably end up in prison for the rest of his life and/or executed.  Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna die. 
I have read about letters and propaganda fliers being tied to balloons and released at the DMZ where the wind carries them to the North. I could see these letters being gathered by SK and US forces for exactly that sort of psyop. Of course, I'm just speculating. 
That could be the case. We definitely don't tell our children about the atrocities we've committed in the US until much later
This is definitely it. Thank you for sharing.
The defectors are usually called "sae-tuh-min" which means something like "newly-housed". I remember having one classmate in elementary school who came down from NK with his mom. I remember him having a normal school life, and no one had anything against him. He was actually quite popular due to his awesome soccer skills. As far as I know, even the  parents including mine were "curious" of how they got there, but showed no hostility. 
I think its important to not equate their actions to decisions of the people though, I think its good to foster compassion towards the north Koreans amongst south koreans.
By people do you mean South Koreans?  The demonizing of North Korea was probably done under the exact dictatorship you're talking about.  The people today are not ignorant of the dictatorships, and are very much resentful about it.  This is especially so after the impeachment of the recent corrupt president, who was the daughter of the dictator.
When I was talking to people who worked for reunification efforts in Korea, I heard that often times Koreans from abroad feel more strongly about reunification than native Koreans. He stated that unfortunately many people in Korea have become ambivalent towards the idea of reunifying. Would you say that's accurate? 
How much of that kind of footage exists? It seems like something NK wouldn't allow to be shot, let alone let out of the country.
My father, who grew up in a communist country, was told of the poor starving kids in America.
Yes and also compassion for the northerners. They did not choose to be that way. They we left behind. Many of our families fled from the North. They had sons and daughters and brothers and sisters who didn't make it. They weren't evil. They just didn't make it out. It is a source of grief. 
I find being bilingual so fascinating. I wish I could learn a second language fluently but everyone I know speaks English so I don't have anybody to speak a second language with to get fluent enough to know what it's like.
Older gen: yesYounger gen: look at West Germany, our economy is gonna collapse
There is a significant amount of radical left in Korea who are sympathetic to the North as a means to be be anti-American or are vehement with nationalism and jingoistic.  Remember that there is a draft in South Korea for all young males of a certain age.  Not unheard of that some Korean youths would look at their current situation and think "I'm here because of this unKorean interloper."  It is very likely that there would be a few among the Korean armed services who don't want to be there and will have a "phase" that echoes radical left politics. 
They were actually my friends awkwardly enough. On a rowdy night a girl had a talk with me about how they despise the Japanese. Mostly because of war crimes.They're in their 30s. Living in the metropolitan areas. I've also had a man get annoyed at me when I said kanpai by accident when I was sloshed. Great people otherwise though. I hope the hate can be let go some day.
Very reasonable to say that, since there's not much science going on there, god knows what kind of food regulations they have over there.
Yes, as you say, Migook does not come from Korean's view of Americans or America as beautiful. It is a direct borrowing from Chinese, and I would venture to guess that the Chinese word for America was from the "-me-" part of America (uh-MEI-ri-cuh), since that is where the stress is (that's why we get "Murica"). Once they had the sound, they likely chose a character with positive meaning that has the "mei" sound.  Also, "han" in "hangook" does not mean one. It is just a proper name.
Yup. My mother bribed the border with 'fine' products purchased on the black market to escape socialist Poland in the '80s.Times were tough... 
South Korea would have a huge hit to their economy. 
I'll have to be honest and say I'm unfortunately not a good resource for this particular question. My dad and I, while we love each other, like many father/son relationships, exclusively talk about baseball. My mother grew up relatively wealthy in that era and I've seen many people her age not even relate to her like "wtf you had a tv?" "wtf do you mean you took a taxi to school?" 
> sympathetic North Koreans:\
> Pretty sure he mostly doesn't wanna dieIf he were to step down willingly, I am quite certain there could be an offer of amnesty and nice retirement package. If he is deposed, he will likely be killed in country long before he gets an opportunity to face war crimes trials (which is likley why Uncle died). Whatever amnesty is granted, it won't be the same as being dictator for life, so as long as he believes he can keep it together, he won't surrender. 
When I was a soldier, I would always salute to US troops, just for the heck of it. Some of them were not used to it, but they always seem to get a kick out of it. Thank you for your service. You are always welcome to Korea.
One important thing is they have a different vocabulary. The use very few English loanwords, if any, and instead use different words. The South Koreans use them all over the place. This isn't even including the rest of their sentence structure. Korea used to have many regional dialects and accents. Some were very strong. Seoul had a different one than Busan, and they had a different one than places in between. Now, South Korea is mostly a standard Seoul-ish accent. However, the North didn't merge towards the same language, so they talk different, even unintelligible to some. 
There's really no reason for south koreans to be bitter. You have to remember the split was ~65 years ago. A lot of people still have family in nk. During the war many families were split up because only some were willing to make the trek through dangerous conditions to escape north korea. My grandma had to cross through war zones at the age of 11 with her parents so we technically still have relatives over there. 
Japanese internment camps, trail of tears 
Pretty one sided description of the Korean War buddy...you do realize it was was the North Koreans...backed by China and the Soviets who invaded the South? And it wasn't just the Americans supporting the South it was  21 countries  of the United Nations who helped defend South Korea from the invasion force. Don't make it sound like the US just decided to bomb the hell out of the North.
The fact that she was elected in the first place suggests the resentment is not as total as you suggest.
A strong argument against unification may be the potential for the SK economy to collapse if it were to absorb the NK 'economy'.
I guess the same way actual photos we get from tourists that go there. Risk their freedom to get unauthorized shots. 
He wasn't entirely misplaced. Tens of thousands of inner-city youth were and still are starving. And I understand that the Soviets in particular liked to portray the problems of racism and black poverty as endemic of the inequalities of the capitalist system. It was a "you may not have much, but at least you're not left to fend for yourself like those poor people capitalism brushes aside". 
It's just how you phrase it. Don't form a causal relationship between the food they waste and people not having enough. The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.
That's kind of adorable. Bonus points for good grandma.
For me was always Africa. My mom gave me a kids book that had a spin wheel on it and on the spin wheel was an about 70% chance of hitting a third world country and it was supposed to say how lucky you are for not being born in shitty countries. She made me spin it if I didn't eat all my green beans.
Biggest is food shortage. During famine, cannibalism happens often in rural areas. Also if 1 person defects, public execution for all family members left behind
Well there are two types of gov officials.1. Comes and goes with gov change every 5 yrs2. Rose up the rank from bottom up.My case is number 2, so.. not much? 
Probably suffer the same fate. I'll imagine it be pretty hard to come out of that environment being normal probably will take years to reach whatever normal is
German here: Our economy didnt collapse! The east drags us down a bit, but overall it works out.
Many still are still wiling to, but the tax is going to be MUCH higher that what is now and younger generations may not like that much
There are plenty north Korean communities are in south.
Kim Jong Un personally taste tests every piece of candy produced in North Korea. 
I mean like a general or something secretly wanting to end the regime.
They are the kind that will send millions to their death before making personal sacrifices.
That's good, some other users were telling stories about negative biases on NK so I expected more of that and it was just nice to see an alternative
Hell, there are people in the Republic of Ireland who are concerned about the economic impacts of reunification with Northern Ireland and that situation doesn't even touch that of the Korean Peninsula. I'll give those South Koreans a pass. It's an absolute clusterfuck of a situation. Although in both cases I think reunification is ultimately the best decision. What's a few years/decades of economic hardship versus fostering an unnatural divide amongst a people that doesn't need to exist. 
I'd say slavery is quite a big one
I've seen this said elsewhere and it confuses me and makes me wonder if education has changed. I certainly learned about all the atrocities against the Native Americans and slavery. We didn't get all the grisly details in elementary school, of course. But we did in high school. This was 25 years ago though.
Unfortunately, yes.  Although it has heightened definitely since then.  There are people who regard her father as a great person, since he was the only dictator that used his absolute power for "good" (for certain people).  People who lived during his rule, that benefited from it, still hail him.  Even today, there are protests by older conservatives calling for the decriminalization of the former president.  The rest of us are hardly sympathetic, and a lot of this resentment is also being carried on to such people.
It would probably be a million times worse than Germany's reunification.  East Germany was backwards and poor but nothing like the disparity between the Koreas.
The tourists are only brought to Pyongyang and other areas which are permitted.  The tourists don't get to see the real North Korea, the villages, or obviously the forced labor camps.  
The ironic part is that NK was stronger - economically, militarily, etc. - than SK until the 80s or so. Additionally, both were dictatorships, so being a Korean just kind of sucked for a while (in a way, Korea is the Poland of Asia...).
It's not just inner city youth. I live in a rural area, wife's a social worker, works with kids that have been abused, trust me, it's a very serious problem in rural america as well.
> The finish your plate mentality isn't healthy anyway.Why, if I may ask?
If you landed on the 30% did you still have to eat your green beans?
I think I fall into that category.  Grew up poor, and although I'm doing very well for myself as an adult I feel like I am in a hybrid gray area where I don't always know what a "normal" person would do.
:/ fuck me
Excellent point. I'm sure SKorean realtors would get excited too.
There was a 3:1 GDP per capita ratio between West Germany and East Germany. Between North Korea and South Korea it's something like 40:1.
Well considering the fact that they've been only divided for short period of time compare to SK and NK. Also, East Germany was one of the riches countries among communist nations.
Those at the top got there due to being complicit in the regime's practices, self-interests, and bootlicking.  They're not all of a sudden going to have an epiphany about altruism and risk their life to save the peasants.  Furthermore, a coup would take more than just one general-- it would take a group of people all risking their lives and the lives of their families for generations to come.  Why would they take that risk when they're generals with the best lifestyles already in NK?
Like most world leaders then?
> Republic of Ireland who are concerned about the economic impacts of reunification with Northern IrelandOther way around, lad.
I remember learning slavery in Kindergarten, and they taught us about rounding up the slaves with a fucked up version of tag. 
I think it's about the same. Like in elementary school we knew about the slaves and Native Americans, but it wasn't really until middle school when we were shown Roots in history class that the conditions became more clear. Then of course we got even further into it in high school, although the primary focus of American history was ALWAYS the Revolutionary War.
Same story with Francisco Franco, in Spain. Ruled from 1939 to 1975. Lots of political oppression, nationalism, women's rights violations, but the older conservatives that lived under him still seem to think he was good.
That sounds a lot like my knowledge of reunification Germany
There isnt a very big gap. The only difference is that NK doesnt use english loanwords, but  the way people speak in NK is no more different than the way south koreans in jeollado speak, for example
I agree, I recall reading from several sources that regardless of the problems in communist East Germany, their quality of products and volume of production was better per worker than just about any other communist bloc nation. I personally believe it was due to the German culture. NK has been more completely transformed in such an entrenched fashion, I think the difficulty of orienting their population into any kind of a modern economy would be profoundly difficult. I do not believe the pre-communist NK culture had a society as modern as the pre-WWII German example.
Yeah, it is pretty disappointing. When he took the power, I was hoping he would be more open to the international community since he lived and was educated outside. Last a few years, I rather wished his father lived longer.
Are those areas visible on like google earth?
Starving ethnic minorities? I don't think the Soviets really should have thrown stones that way
I've spent my life struggling to not clear a plate of food that I ordered and paid for, even if I'm already full.  I know it's mental, but it's really, really hard.    For my daughter, we're teaching her to eat "until her belly is happy".  If she's still not happy, we might tell her she has to eat more of her chicken or broccoli before she can have a potato chip, but as soon as she says she's happy she can stop eating.
I had that book too!
Indeed. Don't have to be poor to buy rice in bulk, in an Asian family you'll go through several kilos per week some weeks.
Was wondering this too... I see the poverty mindset more in people who buy in small quantities because it's "cheaper" even though once for ounce it is more expensive. People used to going through financial difficulties tend to buy what they need to get by, while people who are more comfortable will spend more and pay less overall on things they are sure to use. Like how you can buy a single individual snack size of chips for like a dollar, or a large party pack size for $4 and it is clearly more than 4 times bigger. 
And if someone commits a crime, 3 generations of their family have to be held in concentration camps 
Would assume there would be a bump in tourism from curious outsiders too. I for one would love to visit Heaven Lake at some point during my life.
Also, crucially, the West Germans were very highly educated. That's one thing the Eastern Bloc did get right. Building physical capital is easy once you've already got human capital.That sure as hell ain't the case with North Korea, especially because malnutrition as children stunts people intellectually.
In the even of the North Korean government collapse it would be absolutely no problem to give dietary aid and raise the caloric intake of absolutely every living person within North Korea's borders.
No, but a giant war may be...
People at the top may live a more luxurious lifestyle, but they are also in more danger as the Kim dynasty regularly "purges" the ranks of anyone they have the slightest suspicion of. It's possible that at some point Kim Jong Un will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose, then it's just a matter of deciding if they like their revenge hot or cold.
My 2nd grade teacher was actually born in one. That's all she ever told us, I guess we were too young to get any real details
The reason was politics.  FDR was elected on a "we're dissatisfied with the economy and distrustful of foreigners who terk ehr jerbs" sentiment similar to what we see in recent American politics.  The dead giveaway that they never actually thought it would make anyone safer is that they never actually bothered interning any Japanese Americans living in Hawaii, where Pearl Harbor happened, because that would have really been a hassle, and Hawaii didn't really have voters glad to see their Japanese neighbors interned they way mainland America did.  
My understanding is that the culture, wealth and education gap between North and South Korea is way more severe (now) than the gap between East and West Germany was in 1989.FWIW, even now it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain age (~ 35)
I would imagine that the reunification would be more like nation-building after a fallen dictator. SK would have a lot of help from Western powers if NK government were to collapse. It would take time, but I don't think it would harm SK's economy in the long run.
No, they just look like low-resolution brown and green. Same with large parts of Africa, unfortunately- I wanna see some elephants from space 
The US has orchestrated multiple coups of foreign governments, but our leaders still condemn coups done by others.
Ah, I see. I can see that point, yeah.
I have always wondered how they determined 3 generations. Like if the women don't have kids are they raped?
Yeah, at least the East Germans were well educated and had enough to eat, they just were like 2 decades behind in societal development and weren't used to personal freedom or an open society. North Koreans are neither well educated or well fed, and are close to a century behind.
Isn't the top reason we fought the last world war prevention of that? Among many other reasons of course. 
You're thinking of Iceland. Ireland was where 99 Luftballons bombed North Korea.
I don't know how much one of those would cost, but let's highball it and say $20,000. There are four other living males of the Kim line, so that'd be $80,000 plus shipping.
That is a very good point, but in truth those last two lines were largely intended as a humorous cap-off to what I was saying.
> will leave the wrong person with nothing left to lose,I think you watch too many movies.Hard to picture a 60 year old aristocrat *John Wick*ing a whole government.
Second grade was when I recall learning about Japanese internment. The lesson was simply "this is what we did, here's various points of view about it" and we moved on. That's about how I expect it to be covered.
> it's pretty easy to tell East and West Germans apart if they're above a certain ageHow?
Keep in mind China lives next door. I doubt they'd be thrilled about American GIs handing out freedom on every North Korean street corner...
Cuba is an interesting example I hadn't considered. They're economically behind the world, but they've at least gotten materials and technical knowledge past the embargo - the digital revolution happened there. There's also a large US-Cuban population helping to tie them to the rest of the world. Integrating Cuba (into who I'm not sure) would be tough, but at least the culture gap wouldn't be absolute. NK is hard to even imagine.
Also, the fact that east Germany had support from the then still very powerful USSR which basically subsidised them and gave them access to large amounts of foreign goods. They did the same to North Korea and, for the first few decades, North Korea was doing pretty good. After the USSR and the rest of the east block collapsed, NK basically spiraled downwards rapidly. 
except the higher resolution images on Google Earth are taken using aircraft...
My understanding was that most of the time these family lines simply end in the concentration camp. The women are often raped, though not specifically to create a third generation.
>they just were like 2 decades behind in societal developmentNot at all, they just lived under a very different system. In several aspects they were more progressive than the West. Think legalising homosexuality, women's rights, school system and child care...
You're thinking of Hiroshima. Iceland was accidentally discovered by the Wehrmacht when they were retreating through the nuclear wasteland of Cambodia.
Ever heard of a coup? It's never just one person, but it always starts with one person.
Attitudes, they grew up in a very different environment. Even to this day voting in Germany tends to skew along the old east and west divide on somethings.
Tried finding the pic but couldn't, would you be able to share? Sounds interesting.
That one seems fairly easily solved, though.The US gives huge mountains of aid to South Korea, who then pass it on to the now annexed North Korea.Now you could argue that China wouldn't like South Korea, as an American aligned democracy, handing out freedom on ever North Korean street corner, either, but they wouldn't have a leg to stand on internationally if they  complained about that.
From what I've read, women who are raped by guards (sometimes they enter relationships through fear or because they hope to have a better chance to survive-in my book that's still rape) are executed if they become pregnant. Children fathered by prisoners who are born in the camp usually die because the mothers are starving and can't produce enough milk.
For those who don't know, the show got its name from the way our devices resemble black mirrors when they aren't active / with their screen(s) locked.
I saw that as a 14 year old kid in the late 80s.    Shat me right up it was so plausible.
The set and palette colour were very unsettling. All that grey and green and emptiness made me feel uneasy. 
Worked as a CVS photo technician when this came out.It was extra creepy for me because I realized how easy it would be for someone to be like that.I had been working there less than a year and already had so many people that I knew much of their family history and insight into their family vacations.
Watched it with not one clue what it was about.Fucked me sideways.
There are a few jump scares, but in the context of Jacob's Ladder they don't seem cheap and they are legitimately unsettling.
The book is like that as well. Even when she's being "sweet" you're on edge because you know she'll change in a snap. Such a haunting book. Need to see the movie.
Eraserhead just confused the fuck out of me. I would go so far to say that I am still confused three years later. 
Talk about a movie that's hard to watch again... just because of the sense of impending dread.  You just feel greasy watching that movie.
Ted Levine was so crazy as Buffalo Bill it really makes you wonder if it impacted his personal life. If he wasn't married at the time it must have been tough getting a date.  Who wants to date the guy who played Buffalo Bill. 
And now that guy is The Flash. What were they thinking? Giving Kevin powers like that.
Ok I literally just said the big jump scare in The Thing was the best of all time. But I take it back. The one in The Descent is the best of all time. It was literally the climax of the movie. 
Oh man, I forgot about that movie!!! Mothman Prophecies scared the shit out of me as a teen, and then they casually add that it's based on real events? I just wanted to get that movie the fuck away from me forever. I gotta watch it again and see what I think of it now. 
There are so many scary movies that don't age well, but this is just as good today as it was when it released in 1968.  So eerie.
The bathtub old woman is still one of the scariest things I've ever seen. That and the typewriter scene, which is one of the most clever and iconic horror movie scenes ever I reckon.
God damn, the rape scene in that movie will never leave me.
To be fair, I can think of at least one jump scare in that movie.[Specifically, when the cop is hovering over the junkie's face and he wakes up](/spoiler)
The one part of that movie that always gets me in the last session tape where the doctor asks "Where do you live, Simon?" and the response is "I live in the weak and the wounded." 35 years old making my husband check under the goddamn bed and shit...
Hands down the best acting by a Dog, EVER.
That last scene when they're in the basement was the scariest fucking scene I've ever watched.  And nothing happened!  It was just the tension and the realization of standing in a room all alone with a killer.
One of the most grusome movie deaths Ive ever seen is from Bone Tomahawk
Making up a song about Coraliiiiiiiiiiine!First half of this movie I was like, "Pshhh this shit is for kids. Was my friend high recommending this as a scary movie?"Second half of the movie had me on the edge of my seat and gave me the kind of goosebumps that last for hours after it was over.
I don't find movies like this scary. I'm not on edge or afraid just disgusted and sad.
See also: In the Mouth of Madness
I was so afraid during that movie that i honestly felt like i would die if i didn't stop watching it.  So i had to finish it the next night.
You should absolutely check out Perfect Blue, the film that Black Swan was heavily inspired by.
When you casually find all of your missing friend's teeth in a baggie... Yeah, love that film
LONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH
That doorway part though. Fuck.
I saw this movie on the last day it was in the theatre. I was the only one in there. I knew nothing about it. I just assumed the footage was real. At the end, I was so terrified that aliens were real that I sat in the parking lot on Google for 20 minutes making sure that movie was fake. I'm a grown ass man, and I don't scare easily (or much at all, really). To this day, I have tricked 4 of my friends into watching it with the pretense that the footage is real. 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Good times. 
1408 has something for everyone. Are you afraid of heights, tight spaces, drowning, burning, freezing, dead bodies, ghosts, being drugged, or simply losing your mind? If so, then there's a bit in the movie that will make you uncomfortable. It's a hell of a trip. Definitely one of my favorite movies. 
I'm forever torn on the ending.  On one hand, it was powerful, bold, and *really* sticks with you.  Like, forever.  On the other hand, it's *really* sticks with you.  Like, forever.
I really liked this movie, just saw it recently.  Great atmosphere, great period acting.
I was skimming this thread HOPING someone would mention Signs. I have never been so terrified. I actually have chills reading the scene you mentioned because THAT was the one that took me over the damn edge. I absolutely love that movie, but hell if I'm ever going to watch it again. My family loves teasing me with it though. "Don't look in the pantry, Father...." nope nope nope nope nope! 
"We never play nightcrawlers anymore frank"
"Why are you doing this to us?""Because you were home"*shudders*
To be fair, he said without resorting to jumpscares and this one is pretty jumpscare heavy. Still uses them well though. 
Whelp, I learned something neat today.
I can't bring myself to watch another episode. It is that unsettling to me. And the major reason is: I know these horrific stories are completely possible.They don't write a frontend in visual basic to locate an ip address that's 666.553.343252.23423. They don't "zoom in and enhance". I was impressed by their accuracy.And not only technological accuracy. Socio-political accuracy as well. I love-hate this show. 
Everyone in my theater was silent afterward.  It was very strange, but I think everyone felt heavy.
Now Mark Zuckerberg is *everyone's* photo technician!
Robin Williams is typically light hearted a goofy in movies, especially since he is a career comedian. They probably walked into this not knowing to expect a different kind of performance, only to learn that Robin Williams is an extremely malleable actor that is extremely talented.I don't think people expected Robin to play such a creepy character, so they wrote it off as bad when really it's a fantastic movie.
I've bought a cheap Jacob's ladder and I agree they are surprisingly unsettling 
I've seen Jacob's Ladder, so I feel like I should never take a hallucinogen, because all that imagery is rattling around upstairs still just setting me up for a bad trip. 
Yeah, I'm not watching that... 
Kathy Bates nailed it. 
greeheeheasy
That's why it's so scary.. There's seemingly no motive for the killings. They just like to kill people!
Yes yes, Leatherface has no care about being caught or what will happen next after Sally tells the police about that messed up family.  He reacts like a child that was just trained to slaughter.  
The lack of actual gore is a testament to its genius. 
but none of the jump scares in that film feel like they were put in there just to make you jump, they feel more natural. More like "somebody kicked a door down in the corner and it startled me" vs "The camera panned around and suddenly there was a face right next to the camera and it screamed and I screamed, and everyone was screaming."
(Serious)Yeah, that's the closest any movie's come to switching its entire genre within a minute
I dunno, I'd marry me. I'd marry me so hard
The crawling around in the airduct Jumpscare is definitely up there...but it's not cheap. You kinda expect it to come.However, the worst part of the movie is when you know it's coming, and you can see it... 
It's why I bought a Vive.That and E:D
*inches closer*
Should have been Green Arrow
I love Tilda in it. She was fucking fantastic! I got stressed watching her driving around without saying anything.I am ambivalent about how I feel about her character though. I feel sorry for her but at the same time I feel like she demonised Kevin a lot. I'll stop here coz idk how to do a spoiler tag on mobile and I might reveal important plot points.
thank you. I even looked it up to make sure I got it right, and then immediately got it wrong.
To be fair, you may be thinking of one of the posters for it that does make it look like a comedy. My wifi is shit right now so I'm having trouble linking it, but it's the one where Tilda and JCR are sitting in what looks like a waiting room with the title above them in big block letters, which is a pretty common "comedy" style poster. 
I didn't know what it was about before I saw it.First half builds anxiety with touches of eerie and possible fantastic elements, and right after that scene, everything devolves to a rush of adrenaline. I love this movie.
Can you believe that bitch lied about which cave they were going to?  Fuck her!
It held up pretty well. Read the book. The book adds a lot of context to what the actual events are they talk about. A lot of regular normal people saw and experienced a LOT of weird stuff right before the bridge collapsed. The book is good if you like UFO mysteries. 
I was holding my ex's hand during that part. We both jumped a bit and recoiled. He ended up snapping my wrist. I sat through the rest of the movie with a broken wrist.
Scary and heart-breaking at the same time. This is what I want in horror movies. Scary with a story.
The film that The Others was based on, The Innocents (1961) is also excellent, loads of chilling scenes that just unnerve and really get under your skin. Zero jump scares, no blood and guts, just great storytelling. Think I watched the whole movie on YouTube, def worth checking out.
When he is slowly walking up the stairs "Wendy. Let me finish. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash yer brains in". And he slides between such an eerily calm delivery to growling and back again in a way that is some of the best acting I have ever seen.
Okay, but don't you agree that it's way too good of a film to say it resorts to cheap jump scares? And the jump scares aren't what makes the film so scary imo
I haven't watched that movie in about 2 years but as soon as I read that line, I literally got chills running up my spine. 
It's October...you HAVE to watch it! ...again
Just re-watched this last night on a whim. And goddamn is that dog perfectly CREEPY.
Excellent point.  The blood jumping out of the petri dish is one of the most effective "jump scares" in the history of cinema, frankly.  
"*I* drew those posters."By the way, that's the guy who voiced Roger Rabbit. 
I love the part where a man offers to drive a woman and her baby to the next gas station. The expression of the woman after we see the reflection of the station passing by in the windshield is just genius.
Okay I've had the "making up a song about Coraline" part stuck in my head for like three days now 
the other-mother
It also didn't have that pointless boy character. Coraline did everything on her own (plus cat). There was no "eek save me" moment in the book. She tricked the hand and saved the day. And they left out just how long she was alone while her parents were kidnapped. That's every child's nightmare. 
I like the 80's horror movies (esp since when I was scared of any movie as a kid, my dad and I watched horror and action movies from the 80's to show me how funny they are without audio!), but I HATE movies like "The Hills have Eyes" specifically for the rape scene. I mean, c'mon. That movie was fucked up enough as it was, but adding a rape scene just disgusted me. 
It's even worse when he snaps out of it and realizes what's happening.
Yeah literally they made a jump scare out of a door opening in that movie. That pissed me off. Still very good at building the impending dread though. Their situation just gets worse and worse and worse. 
Wonderful movie!  I highly recommend another orphanage ghost story, The Devil's Backbone.  
There were two reactions I saw to that movie coming out into the parking lot.  One was "that was stupid " and the other was "can you walk me to my car? "  I was in the second group
That's the first completely silent jumpscare that scared the shit out of me.
THAT WAS THE BEST PART ! 
> 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares. Those weren't nightmares, they were memories of the abductions. 
I went it pretty much blind, and I'd definitely recommend people do the same. All you need to know is that it's a very, very tense movie - so be up for that.
The best part is that Goodman's character continues to complicate even after the movie's over. The reality of the situation, what he knew and what he thought he knew about it, what he knew and what he thought he knew about his "guests," there's the reveals about his past, his actions viewed through his mind, Mary Elizabeth's mind, and the viewer's mind...It's fuckin perfectly written, the best antagonist in a long time, and a masterclass in manipulating ironic distance
I was on edge expecting Goodman to dunk him face-first in the acid but no, *pop* and he was gone like that.
I think Goodman seeming like such a kind and gentle man only contributes to how menacing he seems in the movie.
Stephen Kings short story of 1408 scared the dogshit out of me.  It was just forty something pages.  But it was psychologically intense.  
No idea, but the way he stares does stand out.
That's the part that really fucked with me.  There are actual psychopaths out there.  This could happen to anyone.
Even sadder than Grave of the Fireflies?
Yeah, I made the mistake to watch *Threads* first. It made *The Day After* look quite upbeat, actually. (And yes, I'm serious. *The Day After* retains some optimism, comparatively.)
Kind of like Bryan Cranston. I spent the first few episodes of Breaking Bad wondering why Walt hasn't done anything dumb and goofy yet. 
Another one is "Final Cut". His SVU episode based on the Milgram Experiment was good too.
WHAT IS HAPPENING? Is it flipping? Flowing? FALLING?!?!? DAMN THIS MYSTERY OBJECT
There are two people in Hollywood who ruined themselves for future roles by playing a monster too well: Anthony Hopkins and Kathy Bates.
Also, in *The Shining*, the hotel and its ghosts are King's alcoholism.  Unlike in *Misery* though, he didn't realize this at the time.  He later said, "I was the guy who ~~had written~~ wrote The Shining without even realizing that I was writing about myself."
Fuckin right, boys.
You just sort of assume it's always sweltering in Texas, doesn't matter the time of year.
Oh, boy! Here I go killin' again!
Totally. One of these days he's going to hurt someone.
I expected to hate the TV series. But Mads did a great job concealing the monster that his character was with a serene and confident exterior. Some of the CGI and first season "Killer of the Week" stories weren't great, but overall it was FAR too good and high concept for network television.
That's what made Lecter scary. Not the fact that he could easily overpower most people without breaking a sweat. The fact that he *didn't need to*. The fact that, given enough time and the right environment, he could simply convince someone that it was a good idea to let him eat them.
> Starling is in control, barely. She is terrified but has to stay in control, if she looses herself to the fear she's done.This right here made Jodi Foster's whole performance. She did this throughout the film, keeping her face blank, and her voice steady, while showing the obvious signs of fear (swallowing, furrowing/twitching of brow) to those of us who knew what she was thinking. Really a stellar performance from her.
Perfect response
Dammit Monk, just put the lotion in the basket!
Yeah, that one is kind of just tying that whole scene together. You know he is gonna die, it's just up to the Alien to make its appearance at that point.
I honestly don't think I could handle playing that game with a Vive haha. It already gave we way too much stress. 
No sure how believable he would be with a blonde wig, glasses and super leet hacking skills.
that's because The Swintonator is a goddess among mortals
I can't imagine what it must be like to be in her shoes. Even from an incredibly young age Kevin seemed to know what he was doing in regards to how he was around his father, to make it look like the mother was always at fault.   Imagine the mental battle of "my child hates me" and "but he's only young so I must be mad."
It's fleshed out much better in the book. The book make you realize more why Kevin is how he is and his dynamic with his mother. I feel the movie went for the more classical mysterious monster for no reason type thing which is never the case in real life.
On subsequent watches you'll notice that a lot of the cave creatures are visible in the cave before the big reveal. Usually only partially or for a second, so they look like normal cave fauna to the unaware. Good movie. 
And *The Innocents* is the movie version of Henry James' *The Turn of the Screw*. Such a creepy, unsettling story.
Someone in a similar thread pointed out that Jack Nicholson doesn't blink at all during that scene, went back and watched it and got even more freaked out. Seriously creepy shit. 
Totally. That movie is so great at establishing a slow-burning sense of isolation and fear (and just a general feeling of "off-ness") so when the typewriter moment comes it's a perfect moment of true horror. Ugh, It makes me sick to think about it even now. 
Se7en 2: Ei8ht
Oh, yeah, of course. Its one of my absolute favourite 'slow burn' suspense movies.I guess I'm more just pointing out that even the best suspense movies like *Se7en* will have at least one jump scare, even though it was unnecessary to the vibe of the movie, IMO.It was the stuff you didn't see that horrified you. You had to imagine John Doe doing all these acts just based on the end result and crime scene photographs.
(doing my best Tina Belcher impersonation) Eeeehhhhhhhhhhh
From what I understand, that "dog" was acting like that because it was half wolf and in a terrified state. It was confused and scared, so it went into super quiet stealth mode.
Palmers face just before they test is fantastic. A resigned "Oh fuck."What's more terrifying that it's the Alien impersonating him so well it's got his goddamn mannerisms.
Yeah. They are frightening because something unexpectedly terrifying just happened. Not because the music swelled and a cat jumped out of a closet or some shit.
Steroids are basically magical when used safely.
Check out Kubo and the two strings if you haven't already. Made by the same studio and has a similar animation too. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(The aunts are also pretty creepy)
In an interview, the guys who adapted it added the little boy so coralline wasn't just talking to herself the whole time. It made for a better movie, but the book was perfect
It caught me off guard. No jumpscares for the entire movie then one out of nowhere. 
I know every other form looked normal but for some reason the huge guy had like no eyes and it was terrifying
you get outta here with that
I've never felt so on edge watching a movie but absolutely enjoyed it. Perhaps one of the best recent movies out. Ending was a bit on the cheesy side but I still would recommend for others to see the movie.
Apology Accepted. 
She was an awesome heroine, I love how she wasn't a helpless idiot, like so many other women in these types of films. She actually used her smarts and figured out ways out of things.
Yes! the short story was crazy good. I was kind of disappointed with the movie adaptation though.
That's really weird, man. Who'd be into that kind of stuff?
Something different is Prisoners. He has a CRAZY stare in that. Basically hes a detective that is assigned to two missing girls case. Although it doesnt say it in the movie, you can tell his character is wired and barely has sleep. 
Had a friend argue that it ruined it for him. That there was no motive. I argued thats what made it horrifying. That there was no motive. Pure, unadulterated, opportunistic, random evil. 
That's not a bad thing to be traumatized about. The threat of nuclear war was serious business.
Well, he did decide to manufacture and distribute Meth, that's pretty dumb. 
Kathy Bates seems to have really found her niche in American Horror Story. Love all her AHS characters. 
Further, he laments that he does not remember writing the book Cujo. He was drunk throughout the entire writing of it
Canadian Trailerpark Massacre
I'll kill anyone!
That first season is some of the best television horror I've ever seen. They did a great job. 
There's a line from the Hannibal TV series that simply states "Hannibal doesn't use coercion.  He uses persuasion"
He was awesome in Shutter Island!
Alien: Isolation nailed it, but you'd kind of expect it to, considering.
Im a very nervous person,  started playing isolation twice,  had to quit both times due to frighth diarrhea.  The sound design in that game is horrifying
I actually lost sleep after watching that movie. It's so deeply disturbing. 
It sounds like something that will intrigue me while simultaneously fucking my head up, which is sadly the kind of thing I like to read 
Yes, but she chose and planned for her daughter. Kevin was instantly regretted from the moment she had sex without contraception. She was terrified when she found out she got pregnant from it. Her entire pregnancy was a completely different experience than with her daughter. Same with the birth.Reading the book gives so much more detail to her thoughts and feelings behind everything. I really recommend it. The movie was good, but the book just gives you so much more.
>normal cave faunaWhich is still fucking horrifying
From what I understand, that "dog" was half alien and bursting open. It was wanting to kill people, so it went into super splatter mode. 
I love the tension everyone else has too in that scene, implying some of them aren't even sure about whether or no they're the alien.
I read an interesting theory about the end when they sip the whisky...well, they filled all the other bottles with gasoline...and the thing has no idea what gasoline tastes like so takes a big swig and the guy next to him realizes who/what is next to him.The guy who posted it originally was much more compelling...it's been about 20 years since I saw the film and I'm not sure about the specifics.  An interesting read, though, if you look it up.
I wish I had personal trainers, physicians, and dieticians to show me how to do it properly :(
KUUUUUUU-BOOOOOOOO
I was devastated to find out Wybie was only in the film, but I understand his purpose and the fact that he's not needed in the book.
Does the ball hitting the bathroom window not count as a jump scare?
The It that appeared in her kitchen was the scariest to me. She was like pissing herself and missing teeth and she just looked wrong.
That film is so underrated. Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard also give amazing performances in it.
I thought she was really funny on The Office too.
Bates' very next movie was Fried Green Tomatoes.  She was nothing but a sweetheart in that one.  Although she does go a little psycho in the parking lot hehe
I think cocaine was the bigger problem while writing Cujo iirc
Halifax Cheeseburger Massacre
I just love killing! 
I couldn't believe it was cancelled when they announced it, it had amazing reviews, just a small audience. 
"Seemed like a good idea at the time."
If you jack the brightness way up you'll see them in the background a lot easier.  This is true in Quarantine and the Friday the 13th films as well.
Absolutely. They caught that a brief amount in the fillings scene in the 2011 version... some of them clearly have that "How the fuck do I even know?!" look on their face (Chris Hulve sure does!)Naules at that point looks like he's just going to die regardless, the reactions and breakdown in the psyche of all of the guys is fantastic."Now, I understand you gentleman have been through a lot lately... but I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter TIED TO THIS FUCKING COUCH!"
"And the best actor award goes to.... THE THING!"*Explodes in a shower of blood and assimilates everything*
Me too, man.. I'm so heartbroken by finding out all my goal bodies were roiders telling me all I had to do was work hard.
His eyes changed depending on how he was interacting with reality. The reality he was facing was dependant on wether or not he was taking his medication. 
Paul Dano, too. He's always solid.
Indeed. Also water boy... She has that honesty that some actors have that even though I recognize her face, I don't have trouble seeing her as the character she's portraying. 
"I'm older and have better insurance". 
Dartmouth Cheeseburger Massacre 
Nothing that good and morbid lasts.
"I'm tired of these monkey fighting snakes on this Monday through Friday plane!"
Seriously though, these guys sold that tension. if this wasn't viewed by everyone at the time as one of those cheap special effects block busters these guys would probably have gotten awards for properly showing that tension and fear from this scene alone.
Then Tom Hardy comes along and says "i did steroids of course" Paraphrasing.
My wife and I always wait for the Paul Dano scenes where he gets the shit beat out of him.  *Prisoners*, *There Will Be Blood*, *12 Years a Slave*... Dano is always there to take a beating.
Vikki Vallencourt is da devil
Favorite line in a movie, ever. 
Cheeseburger Picnic Massacre
That we got three seasons of that show was a bloody miracle.
Do you see what happens when you FIND a STRANGER in the ALPS!?
In a way... I'm kinda glad they didn't? It'd a cult classic. If it'd have had a blockbuster we'd have got The Thing: Reloaded and the such. 
I have serious respect for people who are open about their steroid use. The deception and lies spread by "fake-nattys" disgusts me, though.
"I like Vicki, and she like me back! And she showed me her boobies and I like them too!" 
Someone pissed me off in the parking lot last week, and that scene immediately sprung to mind. I'm finally old enough that it's true. 
Mustard Tiger Massacre
Not really. I sneezed 30 minutes ago. Sorry.
individuals, maybe they would think it's odd after a couple days. But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable.
You think this is funny but there are like 10 people with bleeding noses reading this and freaking out
In my entire life I have never seen a person that realizes they are about to sneeze race for a tissue.
Good in theory, but as a nurse most people in the hospital aren't really sneezing. My thinking is that a day care worker or elementary school teacher might notice it first. Or someone with a severe allergy to cats or something. 
/r/ShowerThoughts
that's what I'm saying man. 
That'd be good. At the end all of the soldiers put their weapons down as a sneezing man comes staggering out of the building. They weep.
This was my first interpretation of the question as well. You've got that tickle in your nose, but your body is powerless to take care of it. Your eyes are watering, your sinuses are stinging, every breath you take leads to a tiny prickle of pain... I think we'd notice pretty quickly.
I would realize pretty quickly because of this. With all the snow reflecting the sun in my face I'd be the savior who figures it out.
I am right there with you. Fuckin love it. Especially when you sneeze like 5 times in succession and your eyes water and your nose just goes numb, like you didn't even have one. 
...has anyone hiccuped?
I'm guessing he's anywhere from 5'5 to 6'3.
With an hour for a cat?
Same deal here. First time I walk out on a bright day, I'd know.
yeah, but everyone would have to believe them.
I'd say with social media and people writing about anything, it wouldn't take so long before it gets in the news. I'd say a week or 2.I can picture a bunch of people on twitter or facebook: "Wow fantastic, I haven't sneeze in days"Then slowly they would notice each other's comments. Then some not so important blogger would write about it. Then more and more important blogs would, then celebrities would come forward. And Bam! People listen to celebrities's shit. News start talking about it and people get scared. Studies starts around the world.
I can just imagine telling my grandkids about the golden sneezing days of yore.
So it started as of 15 minutes ago. 
I have been on this subreddit for a long time and I think this is my favorite comment I have ever read.
Gotta go to work, hired a PI to watch for sneezes. 
it'd take like a week max.  sick patients that sneeze no longer sneeze.  allergy sufferers no longer sneeze.  social media connects us all easily.  it would get noticed, go viral, and it wouldn't be hard to test the results.  i think you're looking at 3-5 days for the general global community to be aware.
I mean, there is literally people with conditions that make them sneeze constantly, if all of these people (idk how many there are) just suddenly stop, people are going to talk, not to mention tissues won't be sold, nurses around the world are bound to notice some weird shit is up. I think a week at MOST, for the civilized world to know about it. 
Yep, I'm one of them. WTF
We can confirm that /u/copious_hyperbole is dead to his lack of response.goodnight sweat princ

They used to have a button you could just click but they changed that because "The Man" wanted them to use gold. Way to bow down to the establishment, reddit. You used to be cool, man.
No this am he the copius-hiperbowl. AM good. No worry. Must leave for exkuse reason. Bi forever!
I do this all of the time
Thank you, I was trying to think if I was crazy or not because I don't think I've seen someone sneeze into a tissue.  Maybe some old timey, 3 piece suit wearing guys who sneeze into their cloth handkerchief, and then use it to wipe their mouths and eyes.  Gross.  
Yeah, it would definitely be all the people with allergies first
Well, *someone* is bound to overreact though.  *This lack of sneezing is mentioned indirectly in Revaluations! The end is upon us!*
It's actually identical to the last season of Torchwood... But with death instead.
They could hire people to pretend to sneeze.
/r/ShowerQuestions
I haven't smoked in weeks and I feel like I've got a contact high from that question
I think you're lying because I can't remember the last time I sneezed. OP is clearly a rogue government scientist that has decided to tell everyone the top secret research that governments perform to maintain control of the world.
I can't wait to see the cinematography for that.  A 10 minute long shot of Clive Owen walking with someone sneezing and everyone staring. 
Same here.  I think that's how it would work.  People with allergies would realize within a couple days, comment on it to other people, other people would start going "you know, I haven't sneezed in a while either" and word would spread until it became clear.
How do you know that wasn't the last sneeze ever? You could have been the last person to sneeze.
Some people are just loud sneezers, you judgmental fuck. 
Found the fed.
Fuck that. Shoot him!!! We don't want that shit spreading!!
When he opens the box and its his wifes head??
Yeah he meant torturous
I feel like Reddit would though. The only other platform I think might know sooner would be twitter
I found the sneeze fetishists.
I had the hiccups a couple hours ago, sorry. 
I read this without noticing the exclamation mark. "I wish, at least once a year, I have a horribly painful hiccuping episode.
Playing safe with averages and a range, I see. /u/Dudwithacake, I'm going all in with 5'3.
It's an actual observed phenomenon called photic sneezing, or Autosomal dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) syndrome. (I'm not making that up.) It's not well understood, but it affects 18-35% of the population and can be genetically inherited.Source: the totally credible sources that the Wikipedia page uses. Also, my nose.
He's a government shill. It's a coverup
I just keep thinking about what it'd be like trying to explain sneezing to my kids. "Daddy tell us again what it was like, in the before-time.""Well, kids, your nose would feel kind of funny for a second, then there'd be like, a nose-explosion that you can't control, and you sometimes involuntarily made a sound like, 'achoo,' and then you just went on with your day.""And what caused it?""Cats, for some people. Pollen. Too much pepper. Sexual arousal, for one guy I knew in high school."
Your nose, of all noses, shouldn't be bleeding! *Oh God it's happening.....*
Mine was bleeding a bit earlier, but I think that was because I accidentally inhaled some powdered benzoic acid in the lab earlier. Hasn't bled since, so it hopefully killed any eggs that were in there.

New friend?? Score!
We can still blow our noses, you know.
And on desk walls.
The worst is when the tissue box starts getting low and the tissue falls inside the box.Then when you have to sneeze you have be like a fucking ninja to reach inside the box, carefully lift off the next sheet, and pull it back to your face with 1-2 seconds. Anything less than perfection results in grabbing a whole stack of tissues, flipping the tissue box across the table, and sneezing all over your arm.
But who has kleenex always within reach?
"Huh, that's funny, I'm *not* miserable right now. Something's not right..."
And his time to shine would come. He would be world famous, and die surrounded by loved ones and admirers.
2 Kings 4:35>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
They would, but lacking the ability to sneeze, while annoying, isn't life threatening. So while they'd notice, it'd be slower, as developed countries tend to have a higher availability of care and they're likely to have more important things to worry about than lack of sneezing.Not being able to sneeze would be odd, but when you've still got epidemics of TB and Polio, then it's pretty low down the list of things that you report to the WHO.

I sneezed earlier today as well.. Has anyone sneezed since then?

I've been sneezing all day because I caught a cold, but now I'm not sneezing anymore. I could get used to this whole no sneezing thing.

I have hiccups right now. I wish I was sneezing instead.
That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.
Then a post asking that would result in answers exactly like in this one."Shit... I don't know... when was the last time I sneezed?"
Thanks! And, my God. That would be horrrrrrible

Which is why you laughed at it.
The sled in the middle of the room was the jigsaw killer the whole time too.
No don't have your girl sneeze while giving head. The end result is not pretty.
Hahah, I've done that too. I think what makes us look even more like fools though is when we're out in public and randomly start making faces at the sun. At least I can explain myself if I've told someone to look at the sun XD Although they don't usually believe me, so I guess I do still look like a fool lol
Wait...*sneezes* okay now 
we need to start /r/nosneeze as a place to post that you just sneezed. that way, if you're ever unsure, you can check the subreddit to make sure that the world is still sneezing.
DAE remember sneezing? Fuck I'm old.
As now, do we.
I have something very similar but it happens when I'm thinking about making a sexual advance. It's very specific, I can imagine sexy stuff and nothing happens but if I'm lying in bed and I get the idea to make a move on my wife some wire crosses and I sneeze and I hate it.

They are both symbolic numbers. 7 is a sign of completion or fulfillment, and 40 is a sign of renewal or cleansing. There are a lot of symbolic numbers in the bible. 7, 12, 40, 3, 6, 50, 10 and others.

Great pun, can't wait for the SQL.
Got mine a longgg time ago.
I think this is the real answer to the thread. It'd probably take about 3 hours for the public to notice and the realization to spread that more and more people are riding the edge of glory in sneeze-limbo.  Maybe, ten minutes in the hospitals and schools for the nurses and teachers to notice every other person with a sinus affliction all complaining together that the sneezes just won't come. This would make a weird movie. 
never thought I'd see those particular 3 words in 1 sentence.
The boy was dead. Elisha brought him back to life (or, more accurately, God through Elisha).It might be worth noting that there are lots of sexual connotations in Hebrew that could be used in this context (and are used elsewhere in the Bible....like when Ruth lays at Boaz's "feet"). This is not one of them. "Stretched across someone" is not a sexual term. 
If Man is five, and the Devil is six, then God is seven.

Yep, Confirmed HL3, picture Lord Gabe sitting at his desk writing dialog for the game windows open listing to Born Free, all of a sudden he has a sneeze attack and sneezes all of his work on HL3 out the window.

Oh no, it's worse than we thought. Humans aren't losing the ability to sneeze, our governments are simply cleansing away all those who do sneeze. E* we're all done in now, I just sneezed. I only hope the underground resistance is able to carry on the fight we died uncontrollably blinking for. 
yeay girls don't sneeze
guy has good priorities, i approve
He probably thought you were going for his cheek and missed. 
Did you expect him to leave you hanging?
He was probably hiding his boner
Speaking from experience, odds are he probably got hurt a lot in life. I've had people flirt with me as a joke (and I knew it was a joke because she'd rejoin her friends, point, & laugh). That kind of treatment can build up and really damage your confidence and self-esteem.
The Gentleman!!
The only hint that is actually foolproof. Well done.
To be honest, I'd think you were kidding unless I was your SO. It would be too awkward to walk in on you showering and be wrong. 
At least you seem like a really polite guy.

Jamie: I'm gonna fuck my sister.  Avameow: Sooooo, you in the mood?
You: *post a photo of you pet doing something silly*Him: "Hey remember that time you let me touch your boobs?"
She prob had better gear
The arm thing is too subtle tbh. It could just be you being clumsy. Yesterday a girl I was sitting next to touched my arm three times in about a minute and the first two I thought might have been on accident, but the third time I said "what's up?" And she said that it was an accident. So yeah :/
I think you may have gotten rejected
Sometimes Netflix and chill just means Netflix and chill... Doesn't it? ...Shit!
I dunno man. I had a lady friend visit me in a different country while I was working abroad, share a bed with me for two weeks, and practically act like a wife with me. I told her I was into her and when I directly asked her if there was anything going on between us she said no. 
Nah, she doesn't think you're stupid. She's disappointed, but people are pretty familiar with the dangers of dipping your pen in company ink. You're not an idiot. The opposite really. Just keep her in mind if either of you leaves the company! 
Actually I think that one might work.
It's ok...I can literally invite my husband to get in the tub with me, and he doesn't get it. Sigh..
...poor girl, that's like the ultimate rejection. JFC man
Good on ya. Always cut that shit off immediately
A girl in college asked me to study with her at her apt. At some point, she brought up PornHub and pulled it up on her computer. She said, "Omg! all these girls have weird nipples! Like who has nipples like that?!" I was confused af because I thought they were just normal. A few minutes later, I was like "ooh! Let me show you some of my favorite videos" She got super pissed at me and started calling me a creep. I got pretty defensive and eventually went home. Years later I realized that she was trying to show me her boobs.....
Well, did you?
You got zucced. But the only thing that got wet were your eyes. 
Honestly, good on you for not assuming. 
Her : I want to have sex with youMe : Thanks.
Fire is much more effective at keeping warmth than cuddles. That man's a keeper.
>  lured him into a hotelWhat bait did you use?
also as a guy, its hard to tell to what extent that hint goesfrom a simple "i think you're a cool person and we should be friends"to a "you're pretty attractive and i wouldn't be opposed to having a relationship"to "perform intercourse with me"to "im being polite and keeping the party vibes up, but to be honest I am indifferent to you."its hard man. i can barely read books

As is tradition
Why'd you see his dong 
Have you ever known a guy who assumes every girl is into him? Like a girl looks at him when trying to get around him and he thinks she was checking him out? No one wants to be that guy.
Can't stress this point enough. Be blunt about it, we have all the time for that cute flirty hint shit when we're dating. Still remember back in the day when a girl in school I was talking to said "nah I've got you" after I asked about who she was seeing(keep in mind I wasn't thinking about any relationship). Still has me thinking wtf these years later.
That would be my response if some girl kissed me at all even if we were the only people in the vicinity. "The light post is right there did you mean to kiss that?"
What is holding hands but a really slow drawn out high five anyway?
I can just imaging that happening to JD, hilarious 
*"Definitely not falling for that one....again."*
Definitely
She needs to take the guy's advice and just be straightforward about it. 
And yet, if I do the exact same thing ONE TIME...
He probably has a major boner every time Hugo Weaving shows up on screen.

I'll continue to look for signs 
It's this entire thread in three minutes. 
Maybe he just really liked wall e. 
Thanks! I have so many more... I love my boyfriend, but you really need to hit that guy over the head repeatedly with boobs before he realizes you want to have sex.
If only you would have just pulled his dick out and started sucking it we wouldn't have to play these silly games.
Having been in exactly that scenario in high school, I just started repeating "think unsexy thoughts" out loud over and over, it made her laugh
Panic seems to be responsible for many of these stories going no where, but I panic too so I get it. 
GRAB US BY THE DICKS!
Aaaaaand, she's married. Don't worry fellas! Another one will come along!
I hear you. I've had bad landlords too. Unfortunately in this particular instance...our landlord was pretty great. 
I looked in replies to find out why she was adopting out her dogs. 
That's pretty solid confidence. "Yeah I could do better than that and I don't even need to prove it."
I did this for shits and giggles to a friend's dog instagram. I sure hope that dog doesn't get the wrong idea.
That's too logical. Get outta here.
And women blame us for being oblivious. We are, but still...
I mean, it kinda does. I do notice the contract, but just take it as any other accidental contact.
This has been Late Night Dating Tips, with Reddit, thanks for joining us.
Seriously, I've turned girls down before by feigning ignorance like this, that's what I assumed when I read it. It lets you avoid flat-out rejection and makes them think you're just a clueless guy, and lets you avoid sleeping with them.
Yes, Netflix and chill is what I do when my husband takes the baby out for the afternoon and I'm home alone.
And with that all my previous suspicions have evaporated. Any and every conversation I was presently considering to have had sexy ulterior motives was actually just normal friendly conversation.
A Thinker on the Stinker 
No you want to beat IN the bush
Yep, that's my husband. I've tried being coy and he picks up on it like 30% of the time. I've gotten to the point where I just say "Wanna go fuck?" rather than being coy. Works like a charm.
*goes upstairs and turns the game on that tv instead*
Yeah had I realized where it was going I would've been like "nah, I'm not a side dude."

GODDAMNIT ANDREW SHES TRYING TO BE MYSTERIOUS AND SHIT FIND IT YOURSELF
A surprising number of these are young men unsure what constitutes consent, and young women unsure how to grant consent in a way that doesn't disturb the sexual tension. It's almost as if the sexes have trouble clearly communicating their needs and desires to each other because of some unspeakable chasm.
To be fair the automatic assumption that the girls in these stories are desirable may be wrong. I've had signs where the girls version is probably me being super dense and in reality I can read the signs clear as day but am not interested so without needing it to be awkward I play dumb and head out. 
Me: Hahaha. Sure you do. 
Worked out?  She has him captured and tranquilized!
Teach a man to cuddle and he'll fuck for one night. Teach a man to fire and he'll fuck for life. 
Seriously. She said jump and he built a plane, overachiever in my mind.
Yup yup yup, she's probably amazed at my fire building mad skillz.   Wait, she's not smiling. Why is she staring at me? Oh shit. Did I take too long to build a fire? Is the fire not big enough? Is it TOO big? That must be it. Oh nonononono. She thinks I'm a wood wasting blockhead.  I blew it. I'm never gonna get a girlfriend. Dude life sucks. I gotta go play counterstrike.*storms out of the chair into the night...*
Can confirm, as I'm now realizing that I was in the same scenario not long ago and chose to painstakingly gather tinder and fire making materials, start and maintain a fire, and miss every hint she dropped. 5/7 would burn shit again
*Build fire, demonstrate worth. Perhaps then female* will *be attracted to me.*
At least you're a go-getter. Don't beat yourself up...
It's when the woman is staring at the man thinking "kiss me", and the man is wondering "do I have something stuck between my teeth?"
Mine and my boyfriend's code in public is, "Wanna watch Predator?"
Yea...that's a terrible hint, tbh. That would basically be screaming to me that it was a joke and to turn around/look away/give privacy.
Seriously. Who chose the movie? If she chose Saw, knowing the intention was sex, that's kind of alarming.
Ass spaghetti
MICHEEL HOW ABOUT I COME INSIDE FOR A CUP OF NIIIIICE, HOOOOOT COFFEE?!*youre a wonderful man nico, tell me wonderful things!*
Coffee at 3am is not coffee, coffee at 3am means sex!
X gon' give it to ya
"So where are you sleeping tonight?" totally sounds like she's making sure you have plans to sleep somewhere else. If a friend is drunk at your place and you want them gone before they crash there, you would ask, "So who's driving you back home?"
There's no way to tell. Maybe she's just being polite?
I would've taken it as a diss.>I haven't had sex in two years!>Oh that sucks, but I'm not gonna help you out with *that* hehehe>feelsbadman.jpg
Hahaha, I have an SO now so that's a ship long sailed...I also wouldn't know how to find her if I wanted to. Last I heard from our mutual friend, she went to Asia to teach English.
Im laughing way to hard at this
Yeah, she could have made a move. Just enjoying someones company is not a clear mating signal.
Dont worry. I can mostly read books, and I havent really figured it out either.
Seriously. Most of the times guys think "she's totoally hitting on me/giving me a sign." But we're afraid of being wrong and looking like an ass. 
It's almost like some guys  didn't get the hint
We had sex twice, I guess he didn't understand all I wanted was more sex later on 
I don't see it as a mistake. It's a preventative measure against a mistake. Showing up to what you think is a date only to discover other people are there makes you feel like shit. 
Classic strategy, can't spot a tent in motion.
GIRL ON THE BUS BARELY HAD ANY IN HER HAIR
"So she's sucking my dick and I'm here thinking, 'Does she like me, or...'"
Okay then that's a missed hint
thanks, now it makes sense
He didn't know he could do it doggy style so you could both watch X-Files
I have literally dragged my husband by his penis to the bedroom. He's pulled my hair. It's been a fun 10 years.
My first time I swear the entire time up until we were actually fucking, and I mean up until I was balls deep I doubted she wanted to actually have sex and thought it was just some joke and she would stop joking before I did. Welp, neither stopped joking for 3 years after that. 
I used to have bad landlords. I still do, but I used to, too.
Or it sounds like he interpreted it as previous boyfriends couldn't last more than two minutes into *Aliens*, the filthy casuals.
He's a good dog, bront. 
I dunno... I've seen the movie Carrie. People be evil.
I hate that. Or when you're deep in thought, staring into space and you realize that you are looking right at some girl and it's awkward
We have a code now. "Want to take a nap?" The problem now with two kids, one a newborn, is I'm never quite sure if we are going to sleep or have sex until we get to the bedroom. Usually we have a nap and then have a nap.
Damn that ant died and you didn't even get any 
idk she might just be being polite
It's not even denseness, just a failure to properly escalate. Dollars to donuts says they picked up on it but thought "There's no way, she's just being nice or goofy or whatever".
Every time I say "nope, no way she's actually hitting on me", I think back to the days when I would take advantage of the slightest hints and end up embarrassed and rejected.
**HAHAHA YOU MUST BE SO EMBARRASSED!** 
This exactly. Girls are still under the impression that the guy is just supposed to "act" on his urges and make a move. I've always been worried that I will cross some line that I didn't see thinking I was getting "make a move" signals. Girls, if you want to give signals do something physical like touching his hand or taking his arm. We will 100% get the signal if it's physical rather than verbal.
Lol not falling for that again. Where's the camera this time?
/r/absolutelynotmeirl
I think that's for the best. He needs supervision.
But what if you're not good looking but can build an amazing fire?!
That, or he sucks at making fires
Nail on thl3 head
I knew my LV. 99 fire making skill would one day come in handy [EDIT]: and then you can wrap her in your skill cape to keep warm [EDIT2]: wow, first time getting gold, thanks. May Saradomin forever guide your path:)
*light man-self on fire*
Ok so I think I've understood the "kiss me eyes" finally. When I feel awkward that they are staring at me I should kiss them 
Me and my girlfriends code is "Wanna go to the garage?" Because the first night in my bedroom she said, "So this is your bedroom?" And I said, "No this is my garage."
Noooo, but she had the "kiss me" eyes...
As a military man, most of my 0300 coffees don't mean sex.They sure feel like it though.
That or it's just a really fucking weird question.All these responses, why the fuck don't they just go "hey wanna fuck?"
Damn Canadians
You drove her off the continent!
Probably because you smerked a jernt.As an aside: it reminds me of Hyperbole and a Half's Spaghatti Naadle.
Look at you, Mr. Fancy Pants. I saw a book once. I've never even been close to figuring it out as well. 
I don't think he was the one missing the hint there
All of you are too nice. Where were you all when I was trying to get into standup? ;)
"She's probably just being nice, probably feels bad for me or something. It doesn't mean anything."
WHEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU NOT TO?
This isn't even a hint though!! It's a very blatant request. How??
You're 100% sure he got the hint? Some of these comments are making me wonder if that was enough.
"Wow she's putting a condom on me, her commitment to a bit would make Don Rickles proud!" 
Good scenario: the girl's into you and you have a date to prom. Better scenario: a bucket of pig's blood drops onto you and you develop psychic powers.Win win.
Oh god this is too familiar. You space out and come back to the wtf look. 
Do you nap first? Or nap first?
To all the ladies that have made it to this point in the thread - welcome to the reason why we missed your hints. Bc if this isn't "the hint," then I'll never think anything else is. 
Maybe she's from Canada
...guilty of this. When in doubt, I default to this.
Well, yesterday I told a good guy friend of mine that I wanted to have sex with him. Just straight out. He was really surprised but hey, guess who got laid today?
Find yourself a blind partner.
He had to chop down a tree and split it into logs first.
r/unexpectedrunescape
Mate you don't kiss the eyes. You're not ready for this at all.
"FIGHT OR FLIGHT"
Here in my garage...
Healthcare worker. Coffee time is literally anytime. 
What did you say about me?
"there ain't no dick here for me - I'm out"
I was born illiterate. I hadn't seen the printed word until I was already a man!
Yeah you really cant tell in this situation. Shes probably just canadain and beig polite.
DO YOU KNOW THE PHYSICAL TOLL THREE VASECTOMIES HAS ON A MAN
Sex happened so either he got the hint or just said "fuck it" and decided since the kids were outside and we were in the bedroom, why the hell not? Haha
Well, from what I learned from others, it may have backfired more on her than on me. After I rejected her she got back with her boyfriend, and they dated for a few years. I'm not sure if they were together when he was arrested. She and her best friend stopped talking at this time too. I don't know if it had anything to do with me. I never told anyone about this incident. My thinking was that it was better that I lose my chance with her best friend than jeopardize their decade long friendship by trying to defend myself. There were plenty of other girls out there.  
You Aladeen first.
Think I might need to take a trip to Canada.
Or "there's no way she's serious. Clearly she's joking and if I respond genuinely she'll think I'm creepy."
Probably Chris Evans 
Had to dry it out, chip some kindling 
PUNCH HER IN THE EYES!
Got my 47 lamborghinis
She's probably just sucking my dick so she doesn't have to tell me what a loser I am.
Married, with kids, pulled to bedroom by dick where you guys then have sex."But is she *really* into me? I just can't tell!"
Be the change you want to see. *raises arms above head and whirls tongue*
You're not wrong

I watched my own vasectomy, it was interesting. I was more concerned about the nurse...who I  went to high school with and hadn't seen since.It was a bit awkward. 
My MIL passed away suddenly a few years back and I ended up being the one to go through her things for donations because my husband and SIL were too emotional. I found 2 whole drawers of sex toys and homemade porn that went straight into a trash bag and into the dumpster. Never told my husband.  
How did you do? 
At first I thought they were just super chill and open about this whole thing. Like I imagined it was 10am and you were helping a customer find some Code Geass manga and they just wanted everyone to check out their work. 
lol when my dad was in the US Army in the 60s he was stationed in Germany for a year and on more than one occasion they'd load up a missile in to the back of his truck and he'd drive it by himself to another part of the Country. All he had was a sidearm. I think security was really lax back then.Fun fact, he learned to drive in Germany in the US Army. Didn't have a drivers license or anything. They just handed him keys and he started driving around. He was irritated when he eventually got back to the States after a few years deployed and had to take the drivers test.
Fuckin mad eye moody at it again
So I'm assuming as an 8 or 9 year old, you didn't know it was weed.. so when did you figure it out exactly?*15 years later, in bed sleeping...*You: . . .You: . . .You: . . *WAKES UP* IT WAS POT

I found my mom's vibrator as a kid. She told me it was a neck massager. I still cringe everytime I remember this memory. Btw, worst neck massager ever. 
My parents never allowed me to watch Ed Edd and Eddy. They said bad words like "stupid".
Goddamnit Cyril!
I have a similar experience where my mom refused to admit that Santa wasn't real. She had made the "To:" and "From:" labels on her computer to avoid us comparing "Santa's" handwriting to hers, but she accidentally left the program up when we came down the next morning. She insisted that Santa had used her computer. 
> my dad still likes to bring it up at Christmas dinner.Your father is a strange man.  My daughter walked in on my wife and I once when she was about 10.  I have not ever mentioned it to her.  And we double check to be certain the door is locked, now, too.
That's so fucking cool.  
That's when you show him some nudes of your girlfriend so it won't be awkward

And a lifelong love of leather jumpsuits.
That must have been really tough. Glad she's still alive. Hope things got better for your family.
This reminded me of the time I pulled off some mission impossible level shit (at least to teenage me) with my dad.  I put the slightest amount of some face cream I found in the bathroom -- not oily, but left the faintest residue -- on the TV remote buttons, and got him to put in his pin # to unlock his blocked channels on the cable box for me.  I could see his fingerprints on the buttons and later while unsupervised, used that to figure out his code.
Similarly, Chris Pratt placed an order with us and i have his gmail address. i actually had looked the order up when i was investigating fraudulent purchases. People put in fake names sometimes. Sure enough, the address the package was going to was some huge mansion place so i deemed it not fraud. The email address is actually kind of funny, I'm sure he made it himself. No, I won't give it to any of you so don't ask. 
That's some Jason Bourne level shit for a middle schooler.
To think bank robbers in movies lay these really elaborate plans to get into vaults, and then it turns out they could just go in early and see the combination for themselves
Well, at least they all were getting along.
That sounds exactly how my mom died.   Staring up still me, then looking up beyond me, focused on something that only she could see.   And then, the life left her and I could see that...like a light turning off.
For some reason I absolutely think Ted Kennedy was f'ing with your teacher...totally a planned joke to freak out your teacher... I grew up with a very Irish Dad..the bullshit never ends

I looked it up. It wants me to confirm my city, with the only option being Detroit. Then it asks for my email. No explanation or details are given. I'm too scared to proceed any further.
this one's kinda cute and not completely horrible compared to the others in this thread.  the same thing happened to me when I woke up when my dad was putting coins under my pillowcase and taking the teeth for the tooth fairy away.

For the sake of my own sanity I'm choosing not to believe this.
Hahahaha that's fantastic. Teach you to accelerate your child learning! 
Did you say that not knowing it was true?
The one I used to have - she was about 26. Unfortunately being 8 meant I couldn't fully 'appreciate' what I'd just seen (if I was 14 man that would have been some beautiful dream). 
as someone who for several years could only afford to heat my house when my daughter stayed over, I know how awful it can be. Hope things are better for you, I'm lucky enough to be alright financially now

"I taught gym back in the day. There were these two students in my class who were really strange and never left each other's side. One day, I was taking my lunch break (generally had to eat and shower at the same time because I don't have much of a break) when the weirdos come walking in together. They looked up to no good (they were about to head into the same stall), and it was especially odd because there were no gym classes during this period. I told them they weren't supposed to be there, and they got wide-eyed like I caught them doing something they shouldn't be and ran away."
Yep, at family parties I regularly go up to my bathroom to smoke a bowl with various family members / friends. So if going into the bathroom with someone implies we fucked then I am one incestual whore of a man. 
I was like 9 so I was more scared about getting in trouble
> I made eye contact with the guy, and he started cracking up.
Damn, I'm very sorry that you had to witness that.I morbidly think of how different/better/worse life would have been had she succeeded. My own mentality aside, if it weren't for her, I would have never come to America, but because of her she has single-handedly ruined my (half)brother's childhood, and in a way I basically had to raise a kid at 12 years old while keeping her bat-shit crazy ass away from him as much as I could. Families are fucking weird man haha.
I appreciate it. But in the following years I will have learned that my mom is severely emotionally unstable, which helped me rationalize that incident and put it behind me.
It's like when Daryl gets Michael to ask for a raise cuz they make almost the same amount

This is true of ANY company, not just FedEx. HR is there to protect the company, not the employees.
That was literally my first thought
That was in the past two weeks 
When I was a PA I used to get sent spreadsheets from everywhere from my Manager which I then had to send out to the wider team. I always checked for hidden columns but also learned about hidden tabs. One time I almost sent out a spreadsheet to the wider team which had performance feedback per person and their ratings from their Manager and their peers. All this information was in a hidden tab. That could have been so damn messy. Silly HR.
Your cat was definitely the leader of a cult
Haha. That reminds me of my brother who almost did the same. He found a pack of condoms in my dad's old jacket(coincidentally he was looking for chewing gum too) and he started blowing or filling them with water. When my mom came home he started asking why would they hide balloons from him.
She was a habitual condom chewer.
That's the true power of boobs

I saw on this show that they were some kind of modified Blackhawk that allowed them to be much more quiet
"Hey, your daughter makes that same face! Lemme see if I have a pic..."
and then what happened
Yep! That is basically what happened to me except he pulled up the wrong folder on his computer so it was a lot of pics. It wasn't like it was a normal nude either. It was pretty raunchy pics too. She is a great lady and I tried not to think differently of her, but just will never get that image out of my head. She is very attractive so I guess that's a plus at least.  
Sounds like he became awesome at that moment.  Plenty of kids wouldn't have given a fuuuck and been mad about it,
Shit man there are some days when I wonder how I'm able to feed and clothe myself

> Was it real spies or just dodgy companies?Or just a married couple trying to spice things up.

I've wondered if that's how they hire new spy recruits
I did something similar as a kid with an iPod touch. I wiped the screen clean before handing it over and could see the general directions their fingers were going but not the screen. When I got it back I could see the fingerprints and got the password in a couple tries. Felt like such a badass at the time, haha.

Can you send him my nudes?
I must not tell lies...
Though I'm Australian I was born on Papua New Guinea. A little while ago I couldn't find my birth certificate anywhere so I rang the hospital in PNG where I was born and gave them my name and DOB and my parents name. With little fuss I was just told to wire them $70 and they'd send me a copy. I then realised how easy it would be for me to steal someone else's identity either living or dead. 
We had the same friend group so it got passed on to them pretty quickly that I saw them. Those friends had my back and also stopped hanging out with them, which was nice.
Yeah, who cares about sanctions when you can just send assassins to clean up the problem?

Well of course, do you take my family for being savages or something?
I don't know if she knows, but everyone is still married so I suppose she don't know. For all I know I'm the only one who knows what happened that night since its not unlikely they where all blackout drunk.
Im still waiting.
Sassy attacked him?
You bet your ass
I believe the F-117 was responsible for a number of UFO reports before the government acknowledged its existence. 
Personally speaking, I was never to have my bedroom door closed growing up unless I was changing. Didn't matter what age I was. My mom threatened to remove the door when I wanted peace and quiet once and I had it closed. I actually live with my future in-laws currently and at first it weirded me out, because they give us *all* the privacy and don't bug us for shit. They don't come to our room whatsoever. We could probably die in there and they'd have no idea until our bodies started smelling.

No kidding. There are so many logs generated for that. If it ever comes out, it is going to be pretty easy to find out it was you.

I do, what a cunt. Did you manage to get some money off him?
That's sociopathic. I couldn't handle an affair to begin with, you have to be mentally fucked up to manage basically 3 families plus girlfriends.I knew a guy kind of like this, family friends. They had a normal life, big house in the OC, 2 kids, etc. Their life blew up 4-5 years back because he had another house and 6 kids with a woman 50 miles away. How the fuck...
Yeah I'd rather anyone I know see me naked than have them know some of the shit I've gotten off to in weird moments. 
You are correct. Source : am woman. 
I've been the same for the past 4 years, I only put the heat on when she was with me, which isnt that often. For the past few weeks I haven't heard from her. I called her mother and she says "she doesn't want to go to your house to be cold and bored anymore". 
For real. I'd have waited outside the door to see shit hit the fan. 
Emperor's New Groove never gets old
Nah dude, you missed out on Greece. 
I'll do you one better. A friend of mine and his wife MET at a family reunion. Cousins. Same last name. Everything. I think they are at least 3rd or 4th cousins. But woah. 
I love happy endings
I'm sorry this has happened to either of you. I can't imagine what walking in on any of that would be like.
Haha he told Michael to ask for raise because Darryl himself asked Michael for a raise at which point he'd make more than Michael. One of my favorite episodes.
My younger cousin wasn't allowed to watch Spongebob, either. His mom was fucking insane, and one of her rules was "inoffensive words instead of swears are just as bad." She said "what the heck" was just as bad as "what the fuck." Spongebob used "barnacles" like an expletive, so it was banned 
A hooker a day keeps the wife away
What do you mean by hidden tab? A hidden sheet in the spreadsheet??
We had a cat like this in our neighbourhood, a big, white, haggard looking thing. Found him meowling outside my house when my cat went in heat, looked out and there's like 15 fucking male cats on my lawn behind this big badass motherfucker like "send out the wench, human". She gave birth to a couple white kittens a few months later. 
I found my mothers dildo and thought it was a big finger. Ran around the house screaming at people and pointing my "big finger" at them. 
Can we talk about how good those condoms taste? And how often they break?
"No, sorry, that's your wife again... hang on... I have your daughter here too."
If my research is correct they then had a threesome. 
Do we get a fight to the death now?
to be fair, kids don't get that spoiled on their own
Instead I just feed and loathe myself.
Thanks for saying that. I hope your sibling has recovered? My mother ended up pretty unhappy the rest of her life, unfortunately. She died ten years ago and I think she really wanted to go. If nothing else, I tried to not make the same mistakes with my kids as she did with me.

You go in the stall and say the secret password, "bumblebee." A dick slowly emerges from the hole in the stall. There is writing on it. You begin sucking, and slowly some of the writing wipes away from your effort, leaving only the permanent marker behind and revealing your next target.
"But dad I can't read this mess""I FUCKING KNEW IT YOU'RE A SYNTH"
In which case more power to them.  It's like a red team/blue team but at home.  I expect responsible disclosure though no telling your brother/sister until 30 days after you've told me how you did it.

Same for all secret aircrafts, its why UFO sightings change through the years.
I used to fight with my parents about this but they eventually let me have my way. The issue wasn't so much that I was trying to hide anything... it was more just that they were loud as hell and I needed to close the door to be able to hear myself think. 
Yeah that stuff is stored in like 9 different places. If he used the email in his browser you can even find the cached page of that email.

Yeh surely the mother could sue him or something . What did the divorce give the mother ?

And then there's the "very hidden" tabs you can only access by changing their property in the VBA editor..
If you tear a few small holes with your teeth then:   A) The condom can't break if it's already broken (fingeronhead.jpg)      B) The sperm will be too scared to go through the holes because it feels like a trap.

We could tell something was up. 
Yeah, a bit like a danger wank. Couple call up, order 2 sandwiches. The thought of getting caught by the room service guy spurs them on. I mean she was still naked under the covers, and he was sweaty wearing just a towel. Gave me a tenner tip as well, so I'm not complaining!
Some techniques are timeless.

>and he was sweaty wearing just a towelmaybe they were just watching cops
They agree to both become janitors, and eventually work at the same place, go into a bathroom and start kissing by the sinks. Who cares if someones in the stall, they'll just laugh as they run away so gay and gay. 
I KNOW, THAT COPS DOESN'T START TIL 4!

By keeping the photo paper still under the enlarger, blocking the light from the enlarger from getting to certain places on the paper at certain times, and changing the negatives in the enlarger.  The way silver gelatin photo paper works is that the more light it gets, the darker it gets.  By making sure that only parts of the paper are getting light at a time, you can build up the image like stacking layers in photoshop.
Yeah, the War of the Unicorn and Cat were dark times....

There's another one that was even more popular. Like a day after 9/11, every one was showing an image of the towers with smoke billowing out of it that had a photoshopped "demon" face in it. People went crazy over it.

It could be, Photoshop back in the early 1500's was called paint.
Most of the top posts would be easy to explain without any knowledge of photo editing.Taxidermy would explain all the weird animals. Makeup and perspective tricks could explain a lot of the others. The Biden waifu thing would be weird I guess, though it would just make people think he's a weirdo who really likes anime character cardboard cutouts more than actually being unexplainable.

It's funny how people don't know (or forget) that Photoshop and its tools have the names they have *because* it's supposed to be a digital photo shop.The same way Avid Media Composer (and Premiere to a lesser extent) and its tools we made to mimic/emulate a physical film editing bay. *cut, splice, split...*(same goes with almost any other digitized process, cut, copy and paste anyone?)

When you gotta write 3000 words, but could get the point across in 2000.
Your point exactly. It's all because of when these programs launched, they were targeted for that industry. Using their terminology only makes sense. But now the history and context behind the terms is long gone for most. I remember when I was first learning avid in school, a foreign kid just couldn't understand why the terms were splice/ cut. While everyone else didn't even notice and assumed it was called those just because.
that's why things like this and also d.a.w's and video editing programs were created. to have every one of these tools at your literal fingertips

Rewind and fast forward are particularly resilient. Even though DVD and CDs took over the tape media almost twenty years ago. Though, I did just rew~~m~~ind a VHS cassette last night.

[Picture of random low res doggy style with Sandra Bullock's higher res and oversized head photoshopped on.]This likely isn't perfectly accurate, I just typed it from memory.

I'm literally too poor to afford that much alcohol. 
Snort two ounces if you don't believe him.
A lot of friends...So many friends
And "let me tell you".
You could be drinking watered down hard lemonades and this game would still kill you. 
We won't have the health care for new livers.
I'm preemptively cringing at the thought of him doing this. 
Whenever Trump says something you agree with, drink.It's only as dangerous as the rules make it.
And instead of Simba, Joe Biden comes back in several years and fights Trump atop the burning White House. 
So no drinking then?
That could be called winning the game
*everyone dies*

He has the best words, though. 
he uses the word "very" more than an elementary schooler who hasn't learned enough adjectives
I'm a little dismayed at how few people have suggested not watching it. All these drinking games feed his ratings. He feeds on ratings. We need to starve him. BOYCOTT THE INAUGURATION!!
The words President Trump are going to be a reality by the end of the week.
DEATH TO THE OPPOSITION.
What if he opens with Foo Fighters?
with any luck, I should be dead on arrival 
Ghina = 2 shots
His "I'm making a very important point" duck face or the "nothing ever goes wrong for me and I still deserve better" closed mouth smile?
Also pro tip: if you're underage, we all know that's never stopped you before. Knock yourself out. 
Guys in all seriousness, please don't do this, it's not worth it you all have too much to live for
And he points to somone
Or, if you can and want to, peacefully protest. A lot of cities will have small rallies and gatherings. 
I wonder if he'll rename the White House the Trump House.  It's pretty lucrative real estate you know
Don't worry, you won't have to be concerned with money after drinking that much.
Of all of these ideas, this one might be the fastest way to die.
6 ounces if you do.
I want both
Grab her by the China!
Hey makes it sound like he's saying vagina without the va.
All of them such great people. You wouldn't believe what great people they are.
That's his face, we'd be drinking continuously all day.
> two fingers worth >Ivanka........
If they ask why you're stealing all the liquor, just tell them Kanye is Trump's running mate. They'll join in.
SLIGHTLY SCRATCH YOUR MIDDLE CLASS
*Listen to the kids!*
"People are saying..."
Yea. Even if you'd do a non-alcoholic version. You'd wind up with water poisoning.
Should do it with the requirement doubling every time, and that would still barely ward off alcohol poisoning.
Never stop. 
I think we've found the issue: His lexicon contains so few words that no matter what word(s) we decide to drink to, he'll almost certainly use them so frequently that there's a real likelihood we end up with alcohol poisoning. 
LOL. How'd I forget that one! Yuuuge mistake... my bad.
You misunderstood. He's actually the best at dodging military service. That's what that meant. 
I don't think vodka's a healthy choice. Although it is rather apropos given the rumours circulating. 
Especially since it's so disturbingly plausible. 
Hahaha .. very depressed.    &nbsp;    Very depressed is how you should feel.
"I'm Donald Trump"(Weird_Fiches thinks about it, not sure he agrees)
"Barack? Barack, wake up. we gotta go home. Barack?"
Oh, no, it will still be in Trumpisms. It will definitely not be as eloquent. Believe me, I know.
Nope, we're going into a puritan theocracy.
He's not an idiot. He knows his rally audience very well, and he knows who is watching what when he speaks. 
No one wins THE GAME. 
Poor man, died resting on his r key.
**A reply from Daddy Don:** "That's a tremendous question, very very tremendous. There's a lot of questions like that, and you know, I get a lot of the, but only the best, only the best of the best and the best ones are always the ones I remember, I remember this one friend, Paul, and Paul was a great guy, great great guy, really an amazing guy. He told me Donald, he told me Donald, you're by far the best candidate to be president, no doubt, you're the best candidate of all of them. And you know, it's something I realized then, you know, he was right. Tremendous guy."
While the ruleset I've included might get you pretty hammered, this would kill even Andre the Giant.
Fake News: Every time Trump criticizes major news outlet (e.g. CNN, NBC) as fake news because they wrote something he didn't like, take a shot.Orange Russian: If Trump mentions Russia take a shot. If he mentions Putin, take two shots. If Putin suddenly walks onstage, finish the bottle.
Everybody says it, all the time, everyone always says to me: "bLbGoldeN, you have the best of the best words, they're amazing, tremendous amazing!" and I know they're right, because everyone always tells me all the time and you know what? I've heard someone say that I had regular words folks, regular words and really, and really it's sad, sad!
You know there's a lot of research and complicated, very complicated stuff that goes on in the cyber, because it's made by very smart people. Some people once told me that China was the one that made it, but I look at them in the eyes and always tell them: "We're American, you can't fool us." Folks, we're at war, we are, we are, we're at war everywhere and there's people dying instead of being safe here with us, and having a tremendous time. Let me tell all of you something, I'm going to change all of it, I'll change things so much you wouldn't even believe, because I win, I win all the time.
and "Yuge"
He uses it more than a valley girl with "like" and "literally." No offense to valley girls, I am one.

Me too thanks
Oh, so g instead of ch, got it. Thanks!
The BEST people...
The two-handers got me. Great stuff.
Make Reddit Great Again!
Everytime he does it I'm gonna picture this.
So like a normal day then?
There has to be something happening there right? I'm generally fine giving people the benefit of the doubt but there has just been *so much* creepy shit.
"Oh fuck, I'll go get more from the back."
OK I SMASHED YOUR MIDDLE CLASS
"The best."
*Tremendous* water poisoning.
Or dead. Probably dead. 
If two of those are together, the penalty is added then squared. All three, and you drink the whole thing.
Can't stop. Won't stop.
It also doesn't say *what* to drink
What do we drink if he says "dignity?"
u/TheMalteseSailor forgetting catchphrases and utterly failing. Sad!
I started drinking heavily several years ago because of Trump.
Well if everyone who opposes Trump starts drinking heavily throughout his presidency, the only ones alive to vote in 2020 will be his supporters.
There's actually a documentary out there that floats the possibility that half the reason Trump ran in the first place was he was furious at getting embarrassed by Obama during the birther thing at the Correspondant's Dinner and this was his version of revenge. Might explain why he seems to be promising to replace Obamacare with Obamacare++
It's like Head-in-a-Jar Nixon, only much more terrifying.
It's okay, we can use it for 2024. Next election of course **has** to be "2020: Hindsight".
"I am the President of the United States"  *mournful sipping*
Trampled to death by Republicans. 
Right because when I think of Donald Trump I think there goes an incredibly pious man dedicated to simple living and pleasing God through devotion.   
... Dammit!!
Died as he lived. 
Their username is /u/iamdestroyerofworlds, so, yeah, I think they do want us to die.Seems like it wouldn't get everyone, though. Perhaps the suggestion would have been more apt coming from /u/iamdestroyeroflivers.
>brainNow, lets not fool ourselves, aye? 
Funny enough, right now the odds on him saying "Fake News" are 10-1 against it. I put $20 on yes just for fun. I'm optimistic.
that was incredible

***DONDE EST LA BIBLEOTECA***
**Everybody Drinks it:** Whenever Donnie says "Everybody says/does ____" Everybody drinks until he finishes that sentence
It's like I'm listening to him. I'm nauseous now too. I'm sure that's just a coincidence.  
He probably has special ordered gold coloured condoms with his name on them.
You really think that will get you through it?People tell me, I know they tell you and you hear them. They say we have the best tequila. The biggest agave, and the lyin' Mexicans will tell you they have tequila. I know, I know. Believe me. We will have the biggest, tequila and we'll see who gets the last laugh, alright?
I'd lose my ability to comprehend colors before that happens.
You are saying it could have been explained without resorting to vagina?  I do not believe you.
You dont know these people but they're fantastic believe me
That one was my favorite.

I feel like, at this point, he will either come through as a decent president and wouldn't need Pence for the boost, or he tweets himself out of the oval office.

Water poisoning is the best! The greatest type of poisoning! 
Well i was thinking like Diet root beer in my case. Not much of a booze fan
Liver transplants for all! Oh wait, Obamacare's going away. No transplant.
Appeal to a common unspecified contradiction: "Maybe, maybe not".
Boom. Lawyered.
Begin drinking twice as heavily as you were to begin with. Or keel over from shock. Either one works.
So sad. You know what we did to people like him back in my day!?
You're making me want to give up my coping mechanism, you bastard. If I can't drink the next four years away, how will I deal with them? ^^^/s
> Might explain why he seems to be promising to replace Obamacare with Obamacare++You mean Trumpcare.
Aaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrooooooooo!
A candidate has to use that. It's not optional.
*Mournful chugging*
I'm super sad now.
It makes it even worse replacing them with Obama and Biden, considering how close they are.

Here's a little lesson in trickery, this is going down in history...
Talking about it doesn't mean a) it's good or b) that it actually exists, the point is he is referring to body part you would expect a normal human being to have and he is implying he does

Omg don't tempt a man's hope. 
Nah that'd be dumb. We need like a Jeff Hind with a Pat Sight as running mate on the ticket, that way it could be a Hind/Sight ticket. Hind/Sight 2020.

No I'm serious. I use a gambling website and you can place bets like that. Right now odds are 150 to 1 against him using the phrase "golden shower." Dead serious.
On the plus side if we die of alcohol poisoning we don't have to live through his presidency, so it all works out.
DRINK FOREVER.
That's death.
Have vagina. Can confirm.

Eternity is plenty of time for the snail to not only get over the heartbreak, but also figure out that you are responsible. It would likely cause the snail to redouble it's efforts to get you.
Something something decoy snail 
What does a snail even do?
Decoy snail.
It would actually be more interesting to give a million dollars to a snail.
Or you could put that box inside of another box, then mail that box to yourself and when it arrives you can smash it with a hammer. 
Decoy Antarctica
30 years later you're making out with a girl.  Your hand brushes her cheek.  Suddenly, you feel your immortality draining away.  You look with horror at your hand, stained with makeup.  You taste her lipstick on your lips.  You realize that finally, after all these years, the snail has had its revenge.
Easy, make it hard for the snail by always being a decoy self.
Why not put the snail in a snail sized bubble?
Except you just got baited by a decoy snail
I was thinking in the same way as this, with one million dollars, if it can only crawl, I would move accros the ocean, and first calculate it's crawl speed on avarage, and then at about 80% of that travel time I would move once more.
Would League of Legends sell for 1 million dollars is the real question here.
Yes! I'm actually surprised that a mention of RT is so far down in the comments. I remember some other "Million Dollars But" and "Gavin or Google" scenarios posted here that got quite a bit of recognition. 
Decoy snail.
Congratulations, you just stuck a decoy snail up your ass.
For one million dollars that might be a stretch
Not sure a super intelligent snail will willingly run on a hamster wheel for eternity
Because he thinks you had sex with his GF
Something something decoy snail
But you asked a decoy snail
It was a decoy snail.
Decoy Snail.
Ask any million dollars but question in ask Reddit and rake in that sweet sweet karma. OP has found the magic formula.
> snail > spine
with all that salt you could be a pro league of legends player
The snail summons cultists to regenerate its corporeal form. There is no escape.
The snail sneaks into a plane to your destination 
You got me curious as to what movie you're referring to.
Decoy genitals.
Decoy sky.
Cup is a poor choice, it may be able to crawl out, why not use a jar with a lid?  You have a million dollars, you can afford the lid.
But the thing is that he never took his eyes off the snail from the time the deal started. Also, i can only assume that since you got the money when the deal started the snail only got it's smarts when the deal started.  Therefore there is no conceivable way for there to be a decoy snail.
I was thinking the same thing! After probably just a few million years, I'd wish I could die. Not just like when you get depressed when everyone you know dies, but pushing through all depression, I'd say only a few million years before I become Bowerick Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
"Someone I can trust with my life." I'd sure as hell hope my closest friend could trust me and not try to kill me for a million bucks right on the spot. I'd promise him way more money from the investments later on down the road.
What, so it might crawl at a solid 180 feet an hour instead of 90? That's very nearly enough time to move half a block.
You just got baited
Nahhh bro.  *"The Cask of Amont-escargot."*
Shit why concrete? Make it plexiglass and enjoy sneering at it every day.
Snail stuff
What does the snails long term financial strategy look like? Has it considered global markets?
Were you sent here by the devil? 
Decoy drugs.
Do people like grapes? 
Yo isn't it crazy how you could put a million dollars cash in front of a snail and it wouldn't give a fuck it will just crawl away
or, to save on postage, you could poison him with salt! Talk it Kronk! Feel the salt!
It was a decoy box
R/flatearth 
I could try to crush it with something first. If it lives, it's the immortal snail.
> you're making out with a girlThis plan is foolproof!
He's super-intelligent, though. Can't fool that snail.
the decoy snails won't *know* where you are though, and won't be intelligent enough to follow directions.
What if you hire a larger boy to stab the little boy?
I have friends with opposable fingers and a glass jar. Checkmate
It could probably get on a plane in a few hours
Melts him. Now he is an immortal pile of goo that can't crawl. 
Google or Gavin is one of my favourite games.
His replies to other comments are unchanged quotes from the podcast too. This is such a shit thread and such a shit OP.
It's a decoy ass
I want to die
Why would that be a stretch? Nobody said you have to live in a mansion in an expensive part of the continent. 
You make money off being immortal so you can finance it
A hamsterball then. Intelligence isn't going to do much for a snail stuck in a hamsterball.
Keep your friends close and your anemones closer. 
Correct. Rather unrelated to immortal snails, but the series doesn't get enough credit for how well it handles the concept of death. While it's absolutely still treated as a tragedy, it's never treated as a "loss," as in "this person has died, which means they 'lose' at whatever we're doing." It's an inevitability. And the tale of the Deathly Hollows concretes that idea perfectly by treating Death not as some Devil, but even as a potential old friend. "You will die, and that's okay."
is his GF a snail also? How did that work? did you break her? Is this how you developed your weakness to snails? did you steal your million dollars from Super smart snail's Girlfriend? Can snails have mustaches? These are things we need to know OP. 
Mineral water.
Idk I think I could tell the difference between a real super intelligent snail and an ordinary snail pretending to be super intelligent
I feel like there's literally nothing that would be more efficient than "wandering away from the snail". 
With the mineral water company the snail creates with his $1 million, this could really shorten your life span.
TIL snails are ghosts
Oh well then, lucky it was a decoy rocket.
ok then.  if it dies, it's a decoy.  If it doesn't, it's immortal.
semanticstoaster
Wait, I thought the snail thought I slept with his girlfriend? How recent was this divorce? Was the snail cheating on his snail wife with his snail girlfriend?
Hey, now. 
the world is gonna roll me
OP lives in a dorm with the top 1000 League of legends and Dota2 players. If he needs more salt all he has to do is say aloud "I heard Dota was better then League" or vice versa. The ensuing salt explosions will form a new mountain of safety from your snail pursuer. 
Decoy cultists.
Plane probably takes off again after landing before he could get off
It FollowsAnd it was actually really great. Don't know what his problem is with it.
Decoy orgasm.
It is never stated that the snail would be presented, visually or otherwise. Therefore there is no way to keep your eyes on it. If you happen to be shown a snail by the person making the deal with you, you have know way of knowing if it is the intelligent snail or not.
I did not, sorry.
As legend would have it, Cannedinternet spent the rest of his immortal life smashing snails without any sleep or leisure.
I'd lose it in less than 200 easily. 25 is pushing it already.
You can always hope, but I think my own mother would probably put the snail on me 
Guess you should offer the money before anything else, and make sure they promise to help before pointing to the snail. Cause it's just common sense if your friend says "under no circumstances can that snail touch me" to pick it up and wave it in their face 
For the love of god, Montresor!
If I knew how to answer this question, I'd do it myself
Twist: OP is actually in the described situation and is looking for genuine help. Everyone here just thinks it's a thought experiment, but for OP it's real life.
No good sir, I'm on the level.
Wot if...Yer legsDin't knowThey wer legs?
Snails are very wise.
Oh... I feel the salt...
Snail, try to remember the basics of CQC.
Maybe not. That's not a bad idea
that one's satire. use r/theworldisflat, it's honestly hillarious

Even assuming one does not look like OP, i think you might reach a point where you go "so.. i am 10000 times older than her, this is not happening."
Hah, that was a decoy snail extinction
Super intelligent full stop?Or super intelligent *for a snail*?
You get arrested and locked up. Good luck getting away from the snail in a cell.
He writes a letter with his slime, duh.

The snail can hop onto planes too. It's super intelligent.
I'm cracking the fuck up imagining a snail going through customs at an airport 
Yes, but it's immortal and will forever crawl towards me, I will make it's life miserable :)
Well its copy/pasted of course
Burnie you got the name wrong.
Sounds pretty sweet. I wish it wasn't a death-touch snail, it would be cool to be a sidekick for super intelligent snail stuff.
"I fell on it"
Me too thanks 
Snail will bribe a person with $20,000 to get him out of the ball.I know I would free a magical snail from a hamster ball for less.
If a Magikarp can run from me, so can a snail.
Snail's immortal.
Snailed it. Actually that pun had very little to do with snails. So bad. 
Does anyone think if it as a "loss" in that way?I've only ever heard of people saying "loss" to family and friends that no longer have the deceased in their life.
It's pretty simple actually. You just put your micro penis in the shell
But could you tell the difference between a real super intelligent snail pretending to be an ordinary snail and a real ordinary snail? 
"Moving just like, a little" might have it tied for laziness though.
It was a decoy of a decoy snail, so it was the real snail, meaning you launched the real snail on a fake rocket so you just wasted money on a fake rocket that did nothing to the snail.
That's a pretty good way to vet decoy snails
Sex with snail's girlfriend.
Well the snail divorced his wife cause he found out she was cheating on him with you(or at least thought so
You're an all star.
I just spat my coffee on my desk, this is fucking hilarious
have friend smash the snail with a hammer to prove its the immortal snail. if it lives, proceed with the plan, if it dies, shit self.
/r/2meirl4meirl Seriously though, hang in there...you still have a long ways to go
The fuck?  Is that sub trying to cure depression and cynicism?  Well it's doing a bang up job.  You go sub!
Clearly you haven't figured out a way to become a super intelligent snail either.  
The ring came off my pudding can!
"Ryan, why does a triangle add up to turning the other way?"
The poor man wants all that he has notThe rich man wants not all that he hasThe snail neither has nor wantsSo who among them is the wisest? 
Could even go over it. Sliming it up
Right! The salt...the salt for kuzco...the salt chosen to kill kuzco... kuzco's salt...
You can do far worse. Have a vet (the homeless kind) remove his shell and plop him in a little tempered glass jar. Fill it with salt to keep the snail weak and wear that shit as a necklace. 
*virtuous mission plays
Except there aren't enough boxes on earth to box every single snail. OP you're no more prepared for this than we are.

Decoy snail
I have 25 square feet of room to dodge the snail for the next 10 years, who needs sleep anyways 
Oh then I'd just order a new ball every year.
can't believe I'm getting roasted on a post about a hypothetical murder snail 
HAHA I HAD A MIRROR AND NOW YOU'RE DEAD!
You're moving the goal posts. The premise is that it crawls towards me, not towards where it thinks I will be. 
Believe me, I've been behind a few snails in a customs line before.  HEYYYYOOOOO!!!
The snail is kind of a dick.
This is exactly why the snail is trying to kill you.
And "OP" still gets 25k karma. Oh hi reddit, what's up. 
These guys watched last week's podcast
A superhero duo where one dies if they touch. That would be interesting 
Doctor, in a whisper: *Did you get a million dollars to fight a snail too?*
But how could the snail communicate with people in order to do that? OP's snail doesn't speak, and snail drool is transparent when it dries.
You could spraypaint the hamsterball black
"A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains." I'm sorry, can you hop over mountains?
What if the super intelligent death snail is tormented by its own immortality and decides the only way to end it is to end *you*?
but not invulnerable.
"Now it's time to escargot to heaven."
Yeah, they're using it in the wrong context. It's loss to reflect absence, you've "lost" them from your life. It's a misreading but it's still an interesting implication of the language we use when describing death.
911 something something 
I'm actually curious as to what super intelligent means. Is it super intelligent for a snail or super intelligent for a human. Because then we're basically talking about a deadly game of tag with a slightly slower, smaller version of Stephen Hawking. 
Decoy, not fake. The decoy rocket is headed to Arcturus. Bon voyage. 
Get your game on.
Decoy desk
the snail would find a way to make it look like it died

Me and I'll take that million dollars now.
That salt? 
I have a pet snapping turtle.  I already pick up any snail I see with tongs (because they are slimy and gross) and feed them to my turtle.In this scenario, the snail which my turtle cannot destroy in the one that gets boxed up forever.
i know right, i've been banned from that sub on all of my alts. you literally just have to disagree with someone, or ask a question.
After 650, age is just a number.
It's a very intelligent question. Watch out for this guy.
Ummm just put a glass cup over the snail. Too heavy to lift for the snail, and now you're safe. Why is everyone complicating things?
and hire someone to steal the snails money
It's not like he's embarrassing you in front of your friends.
You're right, I didn't re-read the prompt and was focused on "knows where you are". Would be a more interesting match if he wasnt forced to crawl towards you. I think the spirit of the op is simply that it attempts to get to you, otherwise it doesn't matter whether the snail is intelligent or has money, since apparently all its allowed to do is slowly crawl towards you.
>you both become immortal
That snail is immortal though
A constant stream of people who've been paid to hurl snails at you until you just give up.
 It'll move faster.  The snail has Tsa Pre-Check.
Doctor: Then why is it covered in vasoline?You: Don't tell me how to make soup. 
Superintelligent snail goes to a beach and writes a message in the sand by rolling around. Good counterpoint though.  
You can't spraypaint your knowledge its harsh thoughts away though ;_;
EXISTENCE IS PAIN TO A SNAILSEEKS
Yeah ~~angry~~ livid millionaire snail in extreme pain? what could go wrong?
"Take me to snurch"
but the real snail actually calculated that it would go into outer space and with his 234 billion dollars that he got from investing in mineral water he nukes the entire earth, and leaves you intact. He walks up and touches you. GG
Decoy snail
It's a smart/immortal snail. Not a damn reality-warper. We're talking Deadpool immortality here, not Mephisto.
Because I'M ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAIL, SHIT THIS IS A MISTAKE!
I swear it's Springfield's only choice. 
YES that salt!!!
Or leave it with the turtle. It is immortal, but it still feels pain.
You wouldn't want to risk imprisoning the original snail with other snails. He would develop a way to teach the other snails to do his bidding and now you've got like 30 snails on your ass, any of which could be the touch of death. As a matter of fact this might be the origin of all these decoy snails. 
He might be a snail.
The Snail is *very* crafty.  It will outsmart you with a decoy and strike while your guard is down.
I'm not gonna hire someone to steal money. I believe stealing money should be it's own reward.
Oh dear Lord forgive this young man for committing a murder.
You are the snail, aren't you? You won't fool us with your penguin disguise.How long did crawling this post take? Did you have to invent a new input device? So many questions.
He would live there to eliminate the chance of decoy snails. Only the immortal snail could survive coming after him. Then he could set a trap for him.
Just because it survives doesn't mean the journey needs to be pleasant.
He's tough asnails. 
Seriously, this part wasn't made clear at all.  Can the snail be reasoned with?  Maybe I can convince it that it's in the snail's own best interest to let me live.  Maybe he didn't read the rules too clearly either and only just ASSUMED he had to try and kill me.Everybody's all focused on running away from the snail or trying to trap or kill it first, but... Did anyone ever stop and just ask the snail why he's doing it?
I think I know what to do now, you give somebody 3 bucks to put the snail into a plastic hamster ball, and then you *bury* the ball mildly deeply into the ground, snail now is trapped there forever. And you have a free million bucks.
Yes, you can.  It's called huffing.
I just witnessed a murder!
decoy snail
EVERYTHING YOU SAY TO MEEEEEEE
Mission snailed!
We're on to you, snail 
The worst part is I can't even relate the story of this burn later without sounding like a loser. 
And then it all turns out to have taken place a) in a dream b) during a bad trip. I'd watch the shit outa this movie.... Actually, can you imagine the trailer for this? How boring would that trailer be? I'm just imagining a bunch of ominous cuts between a guy running and a snail crawling with a gleam in it's eye.
This would be a great way to fish out the decoy snails though. The one that survives the trek across the flats is obviously the one that can kill you.
Well now the snail has a stillsuit
Seriously, the little guy doesn't gain anything from my death. It's not like I put him in my will or anything, why does he want me dead?
Not in your neighborhood you didn't. 
SENDS ME ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE SNAILGOTTA INCREASE MY SALT INTAKE
It's a decoy snail.
This post was before its time. 
No one has friends on Reddit anyways. We're all karmawhoring
Like that spoon murderer trailer.
That's where the opposable thumbs and glass jar comes in. Checkmate.
If a snail becomes a Buddhist monk, masters his body's response to pain and *still* thinks it worthwhile to chase me across miles of salt in order to kill me: I'm going to start to wonder if I've got it coming...  Hey snail, was I Hitler in the last lifetime? Stalin? Did I step on your eggs? WHY U CHASE ME SNAIL?!?! O_o
Does it also have precog and blue-on-blue eyes?
The snail would seek your death quite naturally.  You are both immortal.  You and artificial intelligence are the two concepts on this planet that represent a real existential threat to it.  Eventually even if people imprisoned it, their culture or even species, if someone doesn't try to free the snail for their own benifit prior, may go away.
I NEED A LITTLE ROOM TO FLEEEEEE
AND I'M MADE OUT OF CHEEEEESE
Which is a real shame, cuz it's gonna be delicious
Maybe getting into jail was the snails plan to put a glass cup over you!
>We're all karmawhoring...on this blessed day.
It could also be that the snail craves the sweet embrace of death, dreading an eternal life of watching all of its snail friends die while he lives on. He knows the only way to die is to kill you. 
'Tis the season to get air in your Anus from too much anal
Ive seen this epsiode on porn hub before
I'm in the same boat. I did hang an Xmas wreath on my front door.This has been an absolute sucky year, made a gazillion times worse because my 12 yr-old dog died in August. He was the family I celebrated with.
I work in hospitality. You'd be surprised how many women in our restaurants freak the fuck out when Mariah Carey's "all I want for Christmas is you" comes on. It's alarming the screams from the grown women everywhere. 
Also working! Apparently people still expect an ambulance to come on holidays..
Is she a pug, too?
That's no excuse to not be spending time with your family.
Holy fuck. I just went bankrupt a few minutes ago. I feel you dude. 
I'm on the toilet, OP. Get off my ass, man. 
Parents just divorced, at my grandparents house watching elf for the 70th time with my sister, love the holidays!
Look at Mr. Fancypants here flying one hour instead of driving.
I'm still struggling with my soon to be ex wife's affair, the holidays are tough. It's been 4 years since I found out and everything fell apart and I'm still a wreck. If you need someone to talk to I'm here to listen, trust me you need to let it out or the holidays will fucking kill you.
If I may ask, what does your wife think about it. If that was my mom, she would have gotten in their faces to tell them to stop with the bullshit and get them both something or neither of them.
It's only 7:52 PM Christmas Eve here. Trying to get your presents early you time traveling piece of shit?
Your day sounds like a great independent movie I'd put on a list to see once it hits the shitty cinema in my town which it never will so I'll forget about it until I see it on Netflix four years later after scrolling through my suggestions for half an hour.
Sounds like your folks are thought poisoned. Sucks for them to miss out on a cool kid and awesome memories... I wish you Happy Holidays and huge successes in 2017. 
We are your family :D
My family is content to sit in the couch together and say nothing. We're doing it now, it's great.
Hannukah isn't a big holiday?  Then what is?
I'm sorry to hear. I used to think I had a mood disorder and my depression was my fault. Come to find out my emotional issues were a result of narcissistic abuse by several family members. Cut that family off and life is amazing now.I don't know your situation but hang in there. Keep searching for answers. I hope you enjoy your Christmas Eve.
I'm sure your cat loves you.
God damn, I wish I had a compound. Or at the least a barbed wire fence around my house.
Perhaps you could make something out of clay to play with?
Have my upvote, ya filthy animal
Not as hard as my dad hits.
Porn star, eh?
Mom had a stroke on January 9th of this year. I'm the caretaker, brother too busy with work. Sucks but it is what it is. I'll get my life on track when I can.Hope your holidays are great and have a good new year!
I can't help but think that the nearest animal shelter might have a lonely dog that's anxiously waiting to celebrate Christmas with someone who will love him back.  
Thanks, it means a lot (:
Thank you very much!!
Thank you. Your post sparked an interesting thought. I can rant. I can rave. I can curse and storm against fate. But through it all I am oddly ... grateful. I have been blessed by them, and no matter what comes next I will always be in debt to all that led me to this point.  
I'm a grown-ass man and you'd be surprised at how I freak the fuck out when it comes on. There's a diva in all of us.
I can explain my jealousy in crippling detail. 
So do astronomers, that is why they went there. 
Well, yeah, because that's the exact location they used. Paranal Observatory.
It is :)  Had a hectic day. Last minute shopping, travelling for hours to get here (on public transport with an overexcited kid) and helping my folks prepare for tomorrow.  Now it's time to relax with shitposts and wine!  
Probably. She's out with her fiance.  
AND firetrucks.  *eyeroll*friggin' Divas.  Put out your own fires and drive yourselves to the hospital.  You'll never learn to take care of yourself if we're always doing it for you!
3pm to 1am here. Single with no kids. I offered to work Christmas and Christmas Eve. Time and a half plus a two full day's worth of vacation. Gonna be a nice paycheck.  
This is my human granddaughter.  I also have a pug and chihuahua on my lap. 
The family that squats together, plops together.
We need a subreddit for people who lost Christmas games to recover.
Can confirm, just got home from a gathering just oozing with passive aggression, taking offence to someome else's personal choices, and shit-talking absent family members. I *wish* I could spend Christmas alone. So much bullshit.
All more trouble and additional expense to him currently. I could agree if he had the money to float $40 for a small claims lawsuit, but the guy is eating rice and butter for Christmas, chances are he doesn't have $40 to float like that.Also suing her would mean interacting more and twisting that knife. Probably better to avoid contact and move on. Extract what learning or lessons you can from the situation, turn the page, and start writing the rest of your story.
Me too. I don't call it reddit, I call it brownit.
4 kids screaming, dogs going crazy, wife and mother gossiping with each other, blah blah blah. At least im in the same room
My family has a picture of all of us kids and my mom in the front room reading books. About 10 years later we realized we had replicated the pictures...with electronics.
Thanks for your kind message. Despite reddit's imperfections, it blows my mind that ranting into the digital ether can bring out genuine support like yours, even at a time like Christmas Eve.
Thanks dude. I guess I've only delayed the inevitable; soon, she'll start demanding to know specifics of my "program." But it's reassuring to know this happens to other people out there.Out of curiosity, what are you studying?
Education, it turns out.
No need for the sarcasm tag. You speak truth.
Hurray two Christmases! 
Mrs. Fancypants, and the drive is 9 hours over mountains with a two year old, so...nah. 
Oh gosh this hit me harder than some of the other emotional replies. 
Thanks man. Been playing Fifa and Final Fantasy XV! FF is so good! 
Hey buddy. I lost my mom in October 2012 and the first Christmas was absolutely awful. Four years later and it's a mostly happy affair for my family with a few sighs and sometimes the occasional tear.  The pain never goes away but it's less "front and center" as time goes on. I hope you'll come to appreciate it for the time you have with the family that's still here at some point like my family and I have.
Thank you 
I feel so hard for you people. I've never been married but my ex broke up with me after dating for 3 years on Thanksgiving 2 years ago and i found out she slept with a roommate of mine the day after christmas. Holiday's kicked my ass and I was only 19. I can't even fathom it being someone you trusted so mich to marry them and have kids with.
I had this happen 15 years ago.  My mom somehow managed to out together one of my all time favorite Christmases  it was a real rough year but I'll always have fond memories of that Christmas. 
It's not as simple as just "be happy anyway".
on the first night of Hanukkah my true love gave to me
Because us jewy-jew-jews (everyone say that out loud) do that tomorrow night.
And a Happy Jew Year 
That's tomorrow- don't get too ahead of yourself
I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree, or leave water out for Rudolph cause there's something wrong with me.
Do you have a "merry Christmas" saying for an Islamic festival? Something like "joyous Eid" or "happy Ramadan" would probably roll off the tongue.
We are all the fuck ups.
1am here in England, merry Christmas! 
And now, 3 hours later, it's still 12pm Christmas Day in Australia.Everyone forgets the west coast #bestcoast
Or the person you'd rather be with told you to fuck off and ran directly into her exes arms. 
Thank youEyes are very white now
"Look, you can keep yelling or you can help me by harmonizing. Do your part."
The writing would probably be pretentious as fuck and there'd be long, pointless close-ups on random shit like empty soup cans or whatever, but if you watch it with a kinda-hot art major she'll think you're deep and maybe you'll get a blowie 
Family hug! :D
my mom always says, "IDK, you start a conversation." Umm, you were the one who wanted to talk
This is a great suggestion OP. I did 5 years in the Army Infantry and got injured in Mosul Iraq. Every night afterwards was a nightmare(literally). VA prescribed me mini press and life has been much more tolerable. Even if your PTSD isn't service related don't hesitate to PM brother. We're all in this together. 
Now that is the holiday spirit! If you guys want a 3rd, let me know. 
It's considered important because it's had to become important so Jewish kids don't feel left out at Christmastime. But in terms of the religion, it isn't a major holiday, it's a minor one. 
I got a legendary.Lucio.It's a frog skin. Fuck you Blizzard.
Eh, maybe...
We live far off the beaten path surrounded by woods and streams. We call it "The Compound", but it is a working ranch protected by cattle and Dobermans.A lovely place by day, but a dark and forbidding place by night.
Damnit! Should have thought of that when the stores were still open. 
I could go on forever, baby.
It's Christmas. A reference to Home Alone should always be expected
Now we know why you're on reddit.
Please make sure that you take care of yourself. You can really get worn down over time. The stress will really do a number on you physically and emotionally. My brother and her family could care less and it's taken a toll. I've let my life get off track for too long. Please don't make my mistake.I wish YOU awesome holidays and a fabulous New Year. Please PM me if you ever feel the the need. I never understood what far reaching impact strokes could have until my mom had both of hers.
that's the only response!
She's a spy.
Are animal shelters open on Christmas? Because if so that's what I'm gonna do.
if you don't have friends like me you can always shoot me a PM buddy
One of the best Christmas songs to come out in the last 30+ years.So many people try to come out with "new" Christmas songs all the time.  None are anywhere near as catchy.  They all just seem so.... fake?  Lifeless?  I don't know.  But they're nowhere close.
Please do explain your jealousy in excruciating detail.
#&nbsp;#&nbsp;^^that's ^^deep.
That sounds exhausting.Have a Merry Christmas tomorrow! =)
Damn swingers having all the Christmas fun 
Ugh, I guess I'll make sure the runway at this airport doesn't ice up so all you jerks can go see your families... Then again, I'm Jewish so I kinda volunteered to work.Edit - WOOWOO!!! ALL ABOARD THE GOLD TRAIN!!! SEE YOU SUCKERS IN THE LOUNGE!!! Seriously though, thank you muchly kind stranger! I hardly think doing what I do is gold worthy. Honestly, I'd do it for free. I get to be up close and personal with big trucks and planes.Edit 2 - Hanukkah started tonight?! I had no idea... /s
Had a stroke patient a few minutes ago. It's like they have no regard to my need to bake cookies and watch Christmas movies. 
But...but... this is the big one! I'm dyin'!    *You hear that, Elizabeth?! I'm comin' to join ya, honey!*
So... Was that the shitpost of Christmas Past, Present, or Future?
7pm to 7am here. Working at the front desk of a motel. Someone's gotta keep the rooms warm and doors open for hookers and junkies ;) 
"This is my human granddaughter." i can't stop laughing at this 
You see Ivan, when you of squat with fam, you share bonding time over hating of Capitalist pig.

I'm sorry dude. Here, take some love.
Sometimes it's reddit. Those are scary times
Are we in the same house?
We're not the typical household, but it works! :)
The way you write tells me that you are an intelligent well rounded and reasonable person. PhD or not, you'll be fine I am sure. 
Well, at least it sounds like you're living away from home. Distance definitely helps. Also, r/AsianParentStories is your friend.Applied math! Specifically, physics-based models that are used to study living systems.
The next time she starts in on you, tell her that you're just not smart enough to earn a PhD like her and your late father - and that's it's obviously because of the recessive defective genes they passed on to you.;>
Did you keep the maiden name of Fancypants when you wed, or did you marry into the Fancypants family?
Nice! Ive been wanting to play FFXV but I can't justify getting another game with the 5 im already playing.
I know you weren't talking to me, but I really needed this right now, so thank you.  Technically this is my 2nd Christmas without my little sister; she passed Dec 2015.  But last year we were all so numb it didn't really register.  This year however...it's been awful and I'm having a hard time keeping it together.
Similar situation after 5 years. I know plenty of people have it worse, but its been 10 months for me and feeling like shit is putting it pretty lightly. She was once my best friend and I don't think I will ever be the same again.
We have been really fortunate, we were donated a tree and ornaments. It's just been waves, I'm okay and trying to handle it, and then I just have a pity party. I go between pity/sadness and then guilt. I had so much, I'm fortunate, I'm lucky - why am I feeling bad for myself?? It's been a rough year.
One present
Lots of us did it tonight! In fact, I'm just heading home from a big ol Jewish Christmas Eve right now!
Eid Mubarak!
3 hours behind and you cunts still can't get your shit together.
I'm sorry m8. Hopefully you can still make the best of the holidays.
I have PTSD from something not service related, and I have constant nightmares. I haven't been able to reliably sleep in years. Is there really a medicine that I can get that would help out with that? I never mentioned it to my doc because I figured the nightmares were just something people dealt with...
Don't play without me I want in
Hopefully. And I'm not kidding.  Pm me and I'll give you my number.  Call it anytime 
I'm sure there's an origami version out there somewhere...
I know you've been smooching with my brother
Thanks I really appreciate it! I'm currently looking for work in nyc so the plan is in motion my friend.
You're right.. Many rescues allow fostering though; it's a great way to have animals in your life without the financial commitment.
Thank you!
No, it's high altitude.
It was. But we got there safe and sound and that's all that matters :)  Merry Christmas to you too! Have a great one <3
Happy Hanukkah!
Here it is friend. Hope you talk to someone, PM if you need anything else. (800) 273-8255

I am so sad that is not a thing.
And here is an upvote for you as a example of my love of your love.
I'm trying to force myself to think and feel that way. I'm just so terrified of people getting the wrong idea about me or something. I've never *ever* been good at accepting help from others, but lord knows, if I've ever been in a situation where I needed assistance, this is certainly that moment. 
If it ever becomes Blackit go to the hospital. 
Maybe, do you see a five year old wearing a Sonic costume and screaming that he's a "speed-type" Pokemon?
Sounds like a house I would like to live in.
Hey, thanks! I intend to be fine, and to maintain sanity and decency in the face of my mother's extreme and outdated opinions.
Yes, distance helps a ton. Wow, that sub is too real.And very cool! That happens to be similar to what I'd want to get into if I ever did pursue more schooling (which would hopefully be despite and not because of pressure from my Asian parent).
Diabolical. She might respond by deciding to limit the spread of said defective genes by massacring me.
Oh, sorry, forgot the hyphen.Fan-Cypants. 
That's gaming in your 30s for you.  "This will look great on my shelf!" 
Going to be a while - but it doesn't have to. Just go at your pace, there isn't a rule book. Make changes in your life, get healthier, meet new people, chase your dreams. You can and therefore you should. 
It stays with you. I remember a bunch of strangers donated so much for us including beds, couches, etc. It was crazy. It's also ok to feel bad, you lost things important to you. They're just things but they were yours and meant something. I was 13 at the time but I still have moments now where I get sad thinking about my old toys and how I wish i had them still. What's nice is, you will forever have a greater appreciation for everything you have in life and know how quickly it can be taken away, making you appreciate it even more.

My last few years of living at home, we started to do it both nights.Now I work at a movie theater both nights, do the movie Chinese food thing on Boxing Day all alone...
Make sure CNN knows this is just a greeting!
Obligatory not a doctor.But if you can't sleep this is definitely a thing to talk to your doctor about. One of my roommates in college got prescribed medication to help her sleep because she had such powerful nightmares. There is definitely help out there for you if you ask. 
Alright, I believe ya..
I tell ya what I'm gonna give you, Snakes...
Everyone always forgets Cliff and Bony Bob
My heart grew like 3 times bigger reading this banter. End of day holiday wind-downs are the best, because it's just winding down for more holiday tomorrow. Merry Christmas. 
Every day apparently. :(
NICE TO MEET FELLOW HUMAN WITH ~~SYNTHESIZED~~ HUMAN OFFSPRING
Just you wait 
Hey buddy: take the gift and pay it forward. One day when things are working better for you, you can do the same for someone else. That day will come!
Not too far off my situation...
When they get grounded they play games for my husband. They mentioned it to their friends and all of them were like, "I wish I could play video games for my punishment!"
Do it over phone. 
Oh your two year old is half chinese?
I will* always be afloat :)
I can't help but read the "One Present" like the dude in Episode VII who says "One quarter portion"
Holiday greeting or terrorist chant? You decide! More at 8:00
BUT MY TOMMY GUN DON'T!
Gonna give you to the count of ten... to get ya ugly, yella, no-good keester off my property...
as someone being dragged to the movies on xmas day, thank you for your sacrifice.
As my old boss at the movie theatre I worked at said "it's one of the most profitable days of the year!" It never was
There's a million things I haven't done 
Once I'm finally financially stable again, I'll be damned if I don't pay these good deeds forward. I've ever felt this way before, I've never been the target of so much caring, especially from strangers. It's sobering, and completely altered my perspective on some things. 
That's it young lady. Now you have to do my dailies for a month! 
Sage advice. Same strategy as breaking up with a significant other.
Before I pump your guts fulla lead!
My tired eyes read that as on oxmas day, I imagined you having this awesome pagan holiday around a roast ox and bonfire with lots of mead.
What's yo' name, man?
I was sooooo angry when Adam Sandler's Hannakuh Song came on the radio it was cut off in the car the other day. I'm not even Jewish and it is one of my favorite songs of the season. 
That sounds like... 10x more exciting than Christmas. Someone needs to make this a thing.

That's half of what Skyrim is
It's on meter, I love it
Haha this is why I cannot study or write while listening to music or TV. My papers will just be full of lyrics and dialog I heard.
I'm sorry you lost your mom
This made me laugh, cos SO & I respond to most of each other's questions (about anything) with "in your butt". I may change it up & borrow yours. 
I did this. Moved 1 door down, but I never even spoke to the new occupants of the old place. Just barged in one day coming back from the laundry room with my laundry basket and there's a shirtless dude laying on the couch, probably high as a kite. We just stare at each other for a minute and I say "I used to live here!" and started walking out as he was laughing.
On a similar note, I did park maintenance for awhile and often entered the opposite sex bathroom to clean. I have found myself yelling "FEMALE MAINTENANCE WORKER!" before entering the ladies room
What did you do with the beer and why is the answer you chugged it?
Been giggling like mad at all the stories, but yours? yours pushed me over the edge. I think My laughing just woke up the neighborhood..
Thank you for the diabolical idea of how to get rid of telemarketers! 
I somehow do this e v e r y year
"Fuck you, this is all you get."
I just burst out laughing at 2. Thanks for that.
Imagine you pick up someone elses signal with the baby monitor and start hearing voices in your car. 
I once poured the fresh grounds into the basket before placing the filter in.Upon realizing my mistake, I emptied and cleaned the basket and then placed the filter in its rightful place.Then I poured the water in and hit brew.Fifteen minutes later, I had a full pot of hot water.Not a good morning.
The other day I was checking in at an amusement park. After the guy scanned my ticket, I, for some unknown reason, held out my hand. And the guy handed me his scanner. 
You can lead a horse to your kitchen, but you can't make it cook you breakfast.
Haha I've done that.I was walking through town with my gf at the time, looking at stalls and shops and she was in my periphery, or so I thought... She had stopped to look at something else and a woman of roughly the same height and hair colour was stood next to me.I checked my phone for time, gently caressed her shoulders and said "come on now, it's time for us to head off". And just walked away from this woman.I turned around a few meters later to see my gf a luminescent shade of embarrassed and this entirely freaked out little old Asian woman.
I had to go to Walmart once after finishing my midnight cashier shift from a competing grocery retailer across the street. I absentmindedly grabbed my stuff, approached the cashier and asked her if she found everything ok. We stared at each other blankly for a little bit.
I wish that's how it always worked. If so, I'd be showing up at work in the middle of the night like every single day 
Yeap. The amount of times I've ended a phone conversation with, "Okay, love you, bye," that wasn't with my husband/mom/dad/brothers on the other end is embarassing.
What did you used to do at the airport? I think airports are interesting
I did something like that when I was like 8. My dad was in the car getting ready to take me and my brother to the game room, and I didn't want to miss out so I ran to the car without pants on. Then I hear my mom yelling out the window, "YOU HAVE NO PANTS ON!"
I was making breakfast one early morning and cracked my eggs straight into the garbage.
I once did this in a skype conversation
So.. how did it taste?
I have done this. Instead of grabbing my coffee, I got my tv remote and didn't notice until I got to work haha 
Once I was feeding my 1 year old a banana and talking to my mom. In the middle of the conversation, I pushed the banana in front of my moms face and just waited for her to take a bite. It took like 30 seconds to register that I was force feeding my 48 year old mother NOT my toddler. It was hilarious. 
My boyfriend tried to wake me up from a nap and he started tickling me and I started freaking out and getting scared because I thought he was a wire stabbing into me and I was a mountain? 
i was really hoping it was the other way around :(
It's better than looking for your glasses while you're wearing them. Not my proudest moment...
Makes sense.
Im laughing so hard at "goodnight yourself"
Have done, but with just two. First egg: "oh, dammit!" *Rinses egg down sink*Second egg: "oh...oh, fucking come on"
Sometimes I wake wake-up at like 6 AM thinking I'm late to HS and rush to get out of bed. Those were dark times. 
Most people are kidding when they tell Jesus to take the wheel
Poor foodWhy didnt you help itYOU COULD HAVE SAVED THE FOOD
How'd it taste?
That was the best day of that rat's life.
You reminded me of my favorite one!I kick my truck door closed all the time.  One time, I kicked it closed before grabbing my phone, and in a sleepy panic *threw my keys into the truck just before the door closed.*  I was so out of it I yelled "Yes!" because my sleep addled brain must have thought that was awesome.  Had to wait for my wife to get home to open the door to the house to get the spare.
I worked at a restaurant where we had to knock on the bar door before opening it, I probably did it about 20 times a day for 6 years. Almost every time I open a door that you just have to push open, like a bathroom door at a restaurant or something, I knock really hard like three times. Lots of weird looks. 
Ah crap something similar happened to me. I got to a party and saw people I knew, mostly female, so I gave them all a hug and a small peck on the cheek, get to the one guy in the group, both of us bearded men and proceeded to give him a peck on the cheek. We both just stopped and stared at each other. 
Could be worse. Your hair could be unprotected from 99% of odor causing bacteria. 
Fortunately cats have an ATTACK setting to protect against such mishaps.
I can't stop giggling at the moo cows, now *I* look crazy
I would have cried. Bitter, idiotic tears. 
NOOOOOOOO 
I've peed on the lid before because I had expected it to be up, and didn't realize before peeing. Not a good time. 
Yeah... they probably didn't need the pee to know if you were on drugs after that.
Ha, I've done this at work. The woman on the other end just laughed and said "Love you too" and hung up.
This needs to be higher, I can't stop laughing. That is 1,000,000x worse than calling a teacher "Mum"It reminds me of a time during a Japanese language class where my teacher was a very masculine woman who had a pretty deep voice. She was super nice mostly considering this was a grade 8 language class where nobody particularly cared and got pretty rowdy. In a moment of autopilot, I wanted to ask her a question and out came: "Hey Dad." I felt so bad about it.
I had this happen to me. I had procrastinated on a film study project, started working on it at 8pm the night before it was due, made it about 1/2 of the way through by midnight, and woke up in my bed at 5:30am to go to school with no recollection of anything after midnight. I was freaking out thinking I still had four hours of work to do to finish, but checked the document and it was *done*. Last saved at 3am. I got an A on a project that I barely remembered doing, and I had done the second half *faster* than when I was conscious.
That sounds more like drunk than auto pilot
What size sub?*meat long*
I've tried to put milk in the cabinet where the cereal goes a bunch of times.  I've even tried to put the box of cereal in the fridge. 
And you left the stove on too?
Oh god I've done this more than I care to admit
Why would you eat a stray mint that had just been in your pocket for months anyway?  It would be all covered in lint and gross.
In school in Ireland we have an oral exam for Irish and whatever foreign language you learn, German in my case. So I speak near fluent Irish in my German.I sit down for my Irish exam and start speaking German.I wasn't even on autopilot I was just so focused on not speaking English.
Did you owe yourself money? Send a little message to that deadbeat?
Did anyone say anything?
You have the best child.
We drink maple syrup for breakfast in Canada anyway.
Try retracing your steps. I do that too and it's probably increased my success rate to 3/10
Never pulled that one but I did freak out and start yelling once when I  got up to take a piss at night and couldn't find my pistol or holster.
I put my car keys in the milk fridge at the grocery store one time. Didn't realize until I got to my car and had to retrace my steps.
I'm never sure what to do when I'm in the middle of using a public toilet and the maintenance person yells into the bathroom. Does one yell back, or just finish as quickly as possible and gtfo? 
Had I been a year or two or I probably would have drank it.  I have it to the lunch room teacher who has known my mom for years.
this has been the most entertaining thread I've read in a while.  I think my heart is starting to beat irregularly from all the laughing.
Lol it's fun for that too.  I have a standard angry "THIS IS A 911 CALL CENTER AND YOU ARE TYING UP EMERGENCY LINES" speech for when they call the actual dispatch center, so I just give that haha.  Never get those calls again.  Would recommend answering with a fake agency name so you don't get some emergency call out of the blue one day though.  That could suck.
YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN TO WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT
Just the very image of him angrily hurling coffee at the passenger seat like it offended him somehow has me in tears.
Imagine you drive past an abandoned house with it and hear Russian agents plotting to assassinate the president, using baby monitors instead of handheld radios.
Like sweet, sweet failure.
I knew none of those people where paid. They all just pass on the torch.
I would be flattered personally if I were old and some young thing accidentally carted me off, but maybe that's just me.  When you're old it's always nice to have something random happen like that, as long as you're not being abducted lol.
I worked as a greeter at a store that isn't Walmart.  One day I was thinking about how I had to go to Walmart after work and greeted people with "Welcome to Walmart" several times.  
I work front desk, and now whenever I'm in public I unconsciously make eye contact, smile, and greet everyone I see. Luckily, I'm in the south, so people don't think it's *too* weird, but I have gotten plenty of strange looks and I deserve it. 
Nothing I could compare it to, to be honest 
He was an autopilot. 
My brother did this- family of six (four kids, two adults) drives 30 min to restaurant. Get out of the car, brother isn't wearing a shirt. "I thought I was wearing one!" None of us can even retort, because no one else noticed either.
1. open banana2. discard white parts into trash3. pick the stringy bits off4. notice I'm holding a peel and not a delicious banana5. ...6. go back to bed because clearly I'm not functioning and need to turn myself off and back on again.
Depending on what it landed on I would have still ate it, but then again I'm more than mildly alcoholic.
Skype meetings are the worst about this because you don't have any body language to clue you in that someone wants to say something.So usually one or two people just steamroll the conversation and you basically have to talk over them for 30 seconds to get them to stop and give you some time.It's honestly a real problem with conference calls in my experience.
That sort of mistake is the reason I was nervous for so long about tutoring kids.
Like old beef jerky flavoured sand.
damn that's even worse since you left something behind to take the essential remote with you.
I honestly thought it said 1 year old banana... 
You tell those bastard tunnelling moles 
"And if you look to your right... you'll see my house"
If it was OCTranspo in Ottawa, people might have laughed about it in public but you can be damn certain they made a bunch of passive aggressive posts about it on /r/Ottawa.
Not as bad as not being able to find your glasses because you can't see without your glasses.
It's faster if you do it in the microwave
I cracked one right into the trash can. One tap on the side of the stove then right into the garbage you go! Liquid first, shell second, patience last. 
A heart stopped, or someone stopped breathing. Code red or code blue.  At least that's what I remember from when my mom worked in the emergency room. 
I rushed all over there concerned and apologetic and she's fuckin' arse-deep in a packet of ham and actually tried to cling to the door as I took her out.  She'd seen fuckin' paradise and wasn't leaving.  
These kinds of stories are my favorite.  Your brain was trying so hard to be helpful, but couldn't have failed any harder.
I worked three jobs once, and they all had different ways of answering the phone, plus, of course, my own phone. One day, I picked up a call at one job, and my mind went completely blank. All the caller could hear from me was "Ah, uh, Thank, hello." Pause. "Thank, uh, This..." Then I hung up. 
Most of my friends would probably just roll with it
He smiled.And said.I know why my daughter likes you.It made it worse
He doesn't want to talk right now. 
No, but when I was a kid I was a bit of a tomboy and wanted people to refer to me as "Pete". I think it was a regression!
And the circle of reddit continues
The guy who was monitoring our test was just like "WTF?!?!"
Wait what?
Can I borrow your powers for a couple of nights? I have to finish my thesis.
He was piloting under influence. 
MEAT. LONG
I did this once. In pretty warm weather. I didn't realize I did it until I came home from work and wondered why the whole apartment reeked of spoiled milk. 
A really common one is she asks me what I'm doing (through text), then asks me again a few minutes later (after I've answered, I'd like to add). I always respond "you just asked that" and she says "oh yea. Autopilot".
I used to fall asleep talking to my first boyfriend when we were in high school.  My favorite was when he was talking about something mundane and sleep-me responded with "I'm dressed up as an Indian right now."  I woke up when he just said, "What?"
1-2-3-4-5, btw
*gestures furiously*
Nope. Dead silence. 
he has some serious moments, i admit. other times he's a shrieking pain in the ass.but sometimes he's pretty awesome. 
yeah it was so weird he didn't even blink he just thanked me and went and got his mom. 
He did not, no.My hope is that he didn't notice me.My fear is that he was only pretending to not notice me.
Sounds like you had a few beers before writing this.
I may get fired before this thread is over
I used to be pretty good at making people do this. If you say "Thank you, have a nice day" in the right tone of voice when you hand their card or change back, about 1/3 of the time they'll just drive away. I got two cars in a row to drive off one day. IIRC, only one of them came back, looking sheepish, to get their fried chicken.
I told them I wanted heated seats, dammit!e: ty for gold :D
It took me a minute to figure out what was going on. I looked down at my hand and I was like "uh, I think you need this," and handed it back to him. He just took it like "thanks..." and went on checking the next person like it was totally normal.
Sir, you are a potato.
Yeah I hate when I get abducted
Welcome to Costco. I love you. 
so, safe to say Mr. Peepers was not a chicken then?
Oh yeah? Then what's his vector, Victor?
I think it's because almost everyone at the airport is probably there for an important reason
Absolutely. It's compounded by latency. Even a half second of latency makes that "who is taking the initiative to speak here" so much more awkward.
Did the cat like the cereal?
lol caked.
I think that is just normal for location based subreddits. The one for my area is like condensed bitterness. I'd never want to do a location based meet-up. 
Open the camera on your phone, it sees clearly and you can hold it as close to your face as needed. 
It's permanent, too. Charge it in the microwave once and never have to charge it again.
Gives new meaning to 'Netflix and chill'.
I did this more than a couple times when I was a cook. Cracked the egg into the trash and stood in from of the stove holding an egg shell trying to remember what I'm supposed to do next. 
There are many "codes" at a hospital. When someone "calls a code" it's a code blue. Hospitals have code teams that respond to codes outside of the ER or even inside the ER. Calling a code basically means drop what you are doing, this guy is dying. 
"There's a bug!""Uh-oh" said the programmer, as he rolls over into a more comfortable position.

I do this a lot. I answer my own phone by stuttering out "good afternoon this is ouionme...Uh sorry yeah uh hey hi what's up"
Just keep rolling with it until after the marriage.
Well, at least he liked it.
OK then. We'll talk when we get home.
That's amazing. How did they respond?
Drinking it in front of him is a real power move

Ah, so he's a child. (Am also parent. Solidarity.)

It all went downhill after his mom packed him a beer for lunch.
You are evil in a hilarious way.
I really hope this guy is somewhere else in this thread:> I work at an amusement park, and the other day I accidentally handed my ticket scanner to a customer. Played it cool, at least

By far the best in the thread so far. Just imagining the coworker's face is fucking killing me hahaha
I mean, If I was planning to kill someone, and they offered me a blanket and pillow, I'd probably change my mind.

Even today, that just made me laugh, thank you. 
This is really delightful, lol
He was a social genius among other things.
Robin Williams could find humor in anything. With that being said, I love how this sentimental piece was written by /u/SHITS_ON_CATS. 
Spoken like someone who's struggled with depression.
"Carpe, carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary."
Fucking loved it. Proved he could step away from comedy and still nail a performance.Good Morning Vietnam was my favourite though.
I have been depressed lately, so the other day I went on Netflix looking for a movie to cheer me up. I ended up watching The Birdcage, even though I have seen it several times before. I picked it because I loved Robin Williams and he has never failed to make me laugh. I feel so honestly sad that there was no one and nothing to cheer him when he most needed it. I feel like one of the brightest lights in the universe just winked out and the world just got a little bit darker.
When he burst into Christopher Reeves room shortly after his accident portraying a russian doctor there to perform a colonoscopy...Reeves said it was the first time he laughed and knew things would be alright.
It seems to me that the most successful comedians always have an intimate understanding of how life can make jokes out of us.
According to his publicist he had been struggling with depression.
Good Morning Vietnam
You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
"We are willing to help, Lord, but what, if anything, is needed? For it is true we can seldom help those closest to us. Either we don't know what part of ourselves to give or, more often than not, the part we have to give is not wanted. And so it is those we live with and should know who elude us. But we can still love them - we can love completely without complete understanding."-- Norman Maclean, A River Runs Through It and Other Stories 
Until we roll 5 or 8, Robin.  Until we roll 5 or 8...
Now I understand Patton Oswalt's Tweet. Thank you.
Eerily reminiscent of Oscar Wilde- "work is the curse of the drinking class." 
His vocal talent. Accents and everything. Very well done. Trained at Juilliard right? 
The thing is with Steve Irwin at least I could've expected to see him go in such a way. While tragic it was oddly fitting of him. But, I can't even imagine Robin Williams without a smile on his face much less depression and suicide. His death seems to hit something deeper because of how unexpected and unlike the image we all had of him. 
I don't think anyone could do it convincingly, this made me realize how one of a kind he truly was. 
My uncle saw him jogging in Hawaii--he yelled out, "That's Robin Williams!" Robin Williams heard him, turned around and screamed "Where!!!" Then continued on his run.
When your job is to make everyone else happy, people forget how to make you happy, because they are always coming to you for happiness and assume you are sharing your own happiness, rather than putting off your own worries to cheer them up. It's easy to think the funny guy is in a good mood all the time and forget to ask him how he's doing, especially since when you do he tries to hide his own feelings nut to trouble you with his own
I think it's a pretty common sentiment amongst performers (and probably fine artists as well). The unofficial motto of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts is "If you can see yourself being happy doing anything else, don't do this."It's only the people that want to act/do comedy/dance/sing more than anything on earth that can ignore all the naysayers, even when that naysayer is Robin Williams. That level of tenacity is mandatory in an industry where rejections happen for sometimes years on end before landing a big break.
"Heard a joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor...I am Pagliacci." Alan Moore, Watchmen.
You could almost see both the pain and regret in Robin's eyes during that moment that he said that quote... I almost wonder if, even then, he was depressed and felt alone. I wish someone could have done something for him. Of every person alive, famous, infamous, or just a normal-everyday-person; nobody deserved this fate LESS than Robin Williams. One day we laugh and smile and feel our hearts warmed by Robin Williams.One day, we cry and feel our hearts ripped from our chests. HE was truly a great man.
Depression is a pretty fucked up thing. You can't think or reason your way out of it. You know it is dumb and pointless and makes no sense, but damn it hurts like a motherfucker. It twists your thoughts into awful things and lies to you.
Now that's dark, because in it, he plays a man coming to terms with his wife's suicide. He dies and travels through hell to find her, only to see her cursed to relive all the pain and sorrow and rage that led her to that decision, again and again for all eternity. This hurts to type. 
If I see a picture of him at the funeral I'll burst into tears.
I just watched that, I loved him. "Wait a minute, that's from Good Will Hunting....you're Robin Williams!"
I feel he would be like, "I feel fucking terrible like everyone else."
I've always argued against this rating.  That's just an score based on what Critics thought of it in 1991zSpielberg made a movie for children. There isn't a single person who was a child in 1991 that didn't love it. It is my all-time most played film. Hook was my childhood.Critics hated it. The children loved it. By all accounts, I think Spielberg accomplished his goal perfectly. 
The poem is "The Stolen Child" by W.B. Yeats, if anyone else is curious. Worth reading in full!
"This cappucino is tiny! It's more like an alpacino!"
Another one where he plays someone deranged is Insomnia.  He was fantastic in that movie.
Saddest fun fact ever. 
Mr. Fish - the movie.
I cannot handle watching his work right now, but when I'm ready, watching the Birdcage will be my own personal wake for him. Gah, there I go crying again.I'm so sorry you've been hurting. If it's too much to handle, please reach out to a hotline, or heck even hit me up. Much love for you.
He also paid for treatments Christopher Reeves' family couldn't afford. 
Oh man! That would be so cool to go trick-or-treating and meet Robin Williams. I wonder if anyone ever dressed up like the Genie or something.
Wow, that's really deep. I'm not being sarcastic either.. and yeah, it seems like simple cheap philosophy, but at the same time, there is a bit of very dark truth to that statement, especially in relation to Robin Williams' death. Man.. life really is fucked up :'(
Jesus, that is well written. Its dusty in here :'(
<hug> to you and everyone else who comments.
*huuuuugs*
This is a great comment. I keep hearing people say "I don't understand how anyone could commit suicide." If you don't understand it, consider yourself lucky. I was treated for clinical depression for three years. *It's not something you should want to understand.*
This one. I was talking to my son just last night about Robin Williams and told him he needed to see this movie. I think we'll watch it tonight.
It's not your fault.
That meme is going to be really sad for a while.
He brought humor to the role, but he preserved the character's dignity and humanity to prevent it from being a complete joke or a characture of a gay man.
It's a Rocketship!
Batty's rap stays with me to this day.
Miranda: What happened?Mrs. Doubtfire: He was quite fond of the drink. It was the drink that killed him.Miranda: How awful. He was an alcoholic?Mrs. Doubtfire: No, he was hit by a Guinness truck.
The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.
YES. This movie is SO underrated. And Robin just absolutely kills that role. 
"Thank you...for gracing my life with your lovely presence, for adding the sweet measure of your soul to my existence."May he rest in peace. In paradise.
Such an underrated film. I could never understand why the critics hated it so much. 
 You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome.
To watch that right now would reduce me and my soul to nothing but a sniffling crying sack of lumpy potatoes.
That was my favorite quote.  The theme and ideas are so pure in that movie, the delivery is so perfect.
It would be cool if all teachers everywhere had a moment of silence while standing on their desks tomorrow.  Too bad school isn't in session.
I make a lot of dumb jokes on this website. Sometimes people say "aren't you a doctor?" as if to insinuate that I can't be goofy ... being a doctor is part of what I am, but not all of what I am.
A couple of hours ago, I was watching the episode of Family Guy where everything Peter touches, turns into Robin Williams. After the episode ended, I refreshed reddit, saw the top story and just screamed in horror. Within moments I went from musing of a world full of Robin Williams to living in one without even one of him.
Maybe this was the jungle and God finally rolled it... :(
Those who are most depressed often seem the most content, because they don't want others to worry about them.
Whoever could do it hasn't been born yet.
That makes me smile. 
How many of you just read this in Barack Obama's voice?
Good joke.
When you're depressed, none of your successes matter, and all of your failures--real and imagined--loom large.
Gottfried's got me. 
Alcohilism and depression often go hand-in-hand; one causing the other.
"Sometimes when you win, you lose" 
Prepare for tears.
Oh man, I forgot this fact and thanks for reminding me. God dammit Robbie, why did you have to go!?
Fun fact: every single one of Obama's speeches includes the word bangarang somewhere.
I'm rather surprised this is so far down. I guess it must be a generational thing... 
It's not your fault.
So watch it now, it's on Netflix.
Completely agree. There is a very tender moment in the movie when he tells Nathan Lane's character something to the effect of "what does it matter if I say you can stay or you say I can stay? It won't be a home unless you're there." One of the more touching scenes I've seen regardless of sexual orientation. 
I started the movie thinking it was going to be dumb and over dramatic. In the end I was laughing every two minutes. He just played the role so well.
bangarang!
I'm sure you can get can get a pretty good idea of what voicing the Genie was like by watching Good Morning, Vietnam.
He's got another serious and almost creepy role in Insomnia too. 
I read this all in his Doubtfire voice. I'm smiling now.
Wasn't it a run-by fruiting?
i. am. job. 
The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.Think about that quote.  Think about how it captures both the helplessness of humanity's existence and the hope of defining why we are here.  Any moment where we feel lost in the overwhelming vastness of life we can remember that our purpose isn't to define life, but to contribute to the definition.
It's an amazing movie.  Have seen it several times.
My friend worked on that as an intern. Robin Williams remembered him by name throughout the production and even defended him when a supervisor was giving my friend a hard time. Even when the cameras aren't rolling, he was a great guy.
I think the problem was marketing. Commercials made it sound like a screwball comedy, actual movie was a drama. It was a faithful representation of Asimov's book, too
Our job is improving the quality of life, not just delaying death.
I loved this one:"A doctor's mission should be not just to prevent death, but also to improve the quality of life."
I feel horrible for his daughter...
No--don't give in to the "feel worse" impulse.  You're doing the best you can.  And you're alive.
Or discovered.
I've always thought of comedians of sort of the dark humorist balancing the forces of the universe by making us laugh at sad shit. Comedians probably spend a lot of time thinking of crazy shit that would drive a less creative person fucking insane. Hats off to the clowns.
How could you *not*?
Everybody laughs.
It's ok man, real men cry.
They were roommates at Julliards and they promised each other that if one of them got successful they would take care of the other.  
/u/sucks_at_people probably meant intentional suicides. ODs are often accidental
Yeah, this is too far down. It's one of his best performances, IMO.
Don't fuck with me!
Just checked. They took it off.
I just watched it two nights ago, and he played the perfect "straight" man (har har) to Nathan Lane's over-the-top hilarity. But the true star of that movie is Hank Azaria. He steals the show, which is saying a lot considering who he shared the stage with. 
I hated Red Foreman for a month
I might add that Robin treated us all, we all won.
Or invented
I read it in the voice of Jordan Peele doing Barack Obama.  Luther chimed in a couple times.  He was pretty pissed.  
 Roll on snare drum.
And they did. The Williams family took care of Reeves' son after both Christopher and his wife passed away. 
I think he meant both since it can be often hard to tell, and when doing drugs in those high quantities the lines can be blurred.
It's not your fault.
Well, I was going to recommend he pirate it, but that seems wrong on a day like today.
It'll be on television soon with this news. There is going to be a Robin Williams marathon on every channel. He was that loved.
Eets tha shooz
Bicentennial man?
Curtains...
God, I would hate to be that son. Loses his mother, than his father and than his father's best friend in all tragic circumstances. I know that the son was probably preparing for his father and his mother to pass away (since they had 'terminal' illnesses) but can you really prepare yourself for that? And now with Robin Williams leaving, poor kid.
What with Peter Pan and all.
Awww, well how 'bout this. Give someone you know a random hug. Just a no reason, out of the blue, big ol' bear hug. Then tell them to give one to someone else, and then to someone else, and someone else... Eventually, it'll make it's way to me. One day, I'll get a random hug from someone, for no discernible reason, and I'll say to myself "Oh! That's my Dreamstakeroot hug, right there!"Plus, as a bonus, every person in between will get a small moment of random affection and appreciation. It's a win-win, really. 
Don't fuck with me!
It's not your fault. 
What if this is true, but you've never noticed? 
Oh man I'd kill for an extra hour of ~~sleep~~ watching old tv show reruns and playing with my phone.
DOVAHKIIN, DOVAHKIIN, NAAL OK ZIN LOS VAHRIIN!

He'd clean the entire house thoroughly, then take all of the trash, dust, and misplaced items he's collected and toss them all into one important room. It would probably be most effective in a bathroom or bedroom. The genie could also "clean" the house of some things that would bother you if they went missing- batteries, some lightbulbs, a remote, maybe a door.
I see a loophole here. Buy one of those two dollar toy cars, classify it as 'your car', trade that in for a 1986 Datsun, sell the 1986 Datsun, repeat, profit.
what if you accidently rip off one of your nails? you're fucked dude. 
"Oh no, I can't find Spot!"*Arf arf arf*"Aw fuck..."
I can kind of feel the emotion in this one.
This reminds me of the "shitty super powers" game I used to play with my friends whenever we went to to all-night diner after a closing shift. My favorite one was telekinesis, but only within the context of making soup.Other winners included:- creating sexual tension- always knowing how old a person is- being able to turn on lights with your mind, but not off again 
Would it also throw the smell? If so, I choose this one too.
Just go to school in washington
I did this today... I work in a oil refinery and they WILL NOT lemme in without my badge... And I forgot it... Had to drive 45 minutes home to get it and then 45 back... Lost $50.... :(
Shitty part: it's always warm and mostly flat
The ol' bait n' switch
Granted, but you'll get $500 worth of shit. 
It's only Bud Light.
Fuck, I would use a real wish for that.
But it's only ever pennies...
You should specify what type of rimshot.
Could substantially change your life, though.  You could use it to get laid a shitton, especially in tourist heavy areas.  You would speak the first language of every foreign girl in the bar.That would be life-altering.  In more ways than one.
A kind of shitty burrito is a dangerous thing.
Why do you clip like you're running out of time?
So... double its size? 
I'm failing to see the kind of shitty part
Dump it into the self-checkout at your grocery store, or wherever. It'll take a few months to burn through that much change, but it's free, and using the self-checkout avoids the burning judgement of a minimum wage cashier.
There's not always an arrow, sometimes it's just an icon on the dial.AND ON MY PARENTS' 05 SUBURBAN, IT'S ON THE WRONG DAMN SIDE.That is all.
Dude that's not shitty at all, I would invite you to every shitty party I ever threw.
They said shitty genie, not download adblock.
I had a professor in college who only owned black slacks, brown dress shoes and white button-up shirts (the kind that are formal, but don't have an actual collar, so no ties ever). He owned a lot of each (showed us a picture of his closet), but it was all the same outfit. Great, smart guy but you're right, he was SUPER cartoonish. 
Shit aspect: one minute into your shit, a guy in a wheelchair rolls into the bathroom. Every time.
"shits fucked yo" end of wish
Pay with plastic. Boom wish granted.
"This is the last one""Id like a sandwich""Here's a fucking bullet to the head""Thanks"
Definitely shitty when you're on a long drive by yourself
That would harm me so badly. I'm obsessed with the old arcade game Snake. 
Call Vector Control in your county and say there are a metric crap-ton of mosquitoes hatching because of all the water.  Be sure to mention Zika virus concerns.  They'll shut that down quickly.
Basically the meeseeks ?
It's okay we'll just steal this question, reword it slightly, and ask it tomorrow while we have nothing better to do at work. 
Thats a stoned comment if I've ever seen one.
>Decoy snailsI'm sorry, what?
The shitty part is that the genie is the one doing the other assignments. He dropped out of high school and doesn't particularly care, so the grade you get on them hovers just barely above failing.
> but it's only BudwieserOP only said *kind of* shitty.
The shitty part: one of your more senior relatives cleans it up every time, complaining about it constantly
but only if you shower
that right there's a shitty wish
Wish granted, but it doesn't fly.  Instead, it drunkenly staggers about breaking things and trying to fuck your wife. Also, it's inexplicably racist.
A small portion of your wish shall be granted. I just upvoted all your reddit activity of the last 20 days. Have I done well?
Everyone would just assume you fake-bake....nice and shitty.
You didn't specify what stuff or where it comes out, so now every time someone sneezes, you shit your pants.
Nah, the real wish here is to have chik fil a open on Sundays
But that wouldn't be shitty, it would have to always be ar 5% so it's always warning you it's running low and is in battery saving mode, but never dies
The kinda shitty part is that you don't have to go, but you still get reprimanded for not showing up. 
would people be able to tell the difference?
This power is not ready for mortals.
Yeah well, not sure you want to lose 10 lbs the shitty way.
My inlaws have a Camry from 1984 and it's needed ONE shop repair in over 30 years. Fucking planned-obsolescence. 
You could easily test by doing it in a mirror and seeing if anything bad happens to you
permanent pink eye 
That... that isn't sleep, buddy.
>or have work to do.Sounds like my fault, for procrastinating.
Tbh, Dovazhul would be a cool language to talk in...
I think people are misunderstanding "kinda" shitty and reinterpreting it as "completely fucking useless". The original wish was fine 
I think you have *Shitty Genie* confused with *Satan*
> sell the 1986 DatsunTwo dollars!  Yessss!
Seriously those fuckers can go up to $20k.
They won't get ripped off, because then they won't be the appropriate length. 
Who the fuck spilled spot remover on the dog again?
WHO THE FUCK SAID THEY LOST THEIR 3 FOOT DILDO?! WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?!
Well, if op doesn't have theirs anymore, I feel like this could cause almost infinite virgininess.
Yeah, he misses the smell of ass hair on his head.
Does it have the shit bits in it still?
my favourite is from red vs blue  The ability to fly north. You have to walk any other direction though
I imagine it like a magician, like Gob from Arrested Development.."Ma'am, open that bag of bread.""It's toasted.""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"
I'd throw it into people's mouths
It's as cheap as dirt. 
My work is strictly about passes but they always keep a couple of temp ones spare if you forget...And you're nice to the receptionists.
Ok? It's easier to chug that way 
Masturbate on the master switch.
Prono 3000. The blowjob machine. 
I mean, I guess you could use it for fertilizer.
$50 bucks right now would make life so much more comfortable. Just enough to eliminate a few small worries.
Get a bidet. You won't care if it's a clean shit or not.
An Amazon review of Metamucil: 'It's difficult to fully convey how much I love this product. No single household item has so drastically impacted my life. It's like thinking that the whole world is black and white, and then someone flicks the colour switch in your brain and you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements. This is stuff if legit, yo.'
Fuck, I knew I should have bought Coors. 
Once you give your dog knowledge, then it just becomes depressed like a human.
still, adds up and is better than a kick in the teeth
I found a hundred dollar bill on the ground once. I've probably peaked with my money finding.
[ ](/fl_excited)I call dibs on the other kind of rimshot. I've always wanted to be able to fart on command. 
Ahhhh but it's only after I've gotten drunk *with* them; so, I have to keep them entertained while we drink a lot, while potentially being mutually incomprehensible up until that point.
Pray the clay away really did it for me.
...but he doesn't see numbers above people's heads...
You are perfect.
Like I said, not worth the effort. It's the mildest inconvenience in my life
/r/UnexpectedHamilton
so anyway here's a mutant swordfighting a robot
well, average size but yeah
Every fucking time he said.
You overestimate my throwing capabilities.
Having been a "minimum wage cashier," gotta say, we're not the ones burning with judgement.
Most banks aren't accepting loose change any more, only rolled.  They exist, but finding one would be an adventure.
The side the little nozzle of the tiny gas pump icon is on is *not* an indicator of which side it's on, some just don't have it
That's the shitty part.
A better genie would load you up with uBlock Origin & Ghostery extensions for the perfect 1-2 punch.  
I'm like this, four pairs of matching chinos, four plain black shirts
Me too thanks
And when you have a quick sneezing fit in the car on a back country road, that would lead to true discomfort.
Yeah but occasionally that person is going to be you. 
rip osu people
From the people who brought you "Is a hot dog a sandwich?" and "Is cold cereal a soup?" comes "Is a pedal a button??"(It's not)
^started my period last night with PCOS. Sleep with tampon+pad, still have to get up every 2-3 hours to change both unless I want to change my sheets too. 
And if it gets really successful, we'll do it again next week. And the next week. And the next week. 
When the Americans are all awake. 
Yeah?  Well there's the old joke.  What do you call someone who went to medical school, but had a shitty genie do all their homework so that they barely got passing grades and graduated last in their class?"Doctor."
OK fine Bud Light Lime it is then.
That's not shitty, that's a miracle from god.
Make America fuck again
Holy shit! I did it and then I dropped the toilet paper roll in the toilet!**I HAVE THE POWER!**
It is to me
So, like German sex, but less efficient.
The dad only spoke Klingon to the kid, the mom spoke English, kid started rejecting dad at about 7, and by 14ish could not speak or really hear Klingon
AND MY AXE
You could fix a inconvenient loose toilet seat with the profits!
Still, getting and selling 1 a week for $10,000 (that's how much decent ones are selling for on ebay) would still be $480,000 a year if you took 4 weeks holiday off. Granted the amount of money you could make would go down as time went on, but even if you worked for 10 years you could retire comfortably. Even if we assume the toy car trick didn't work and you had to buy a real, shitty, car for <$500 a week, that's still a lot of money.That doesn't seem like a shitty wish. It'd be life changing if used properly, so I doubt it'd be allowed.
Probably the same asshole who took a bottle of polish remover to Warsaw
A dildo with three feet? I likey.
Yeah but think off all the great olive oil OP could make
Nothing like the smell of ass hair in the morning.
Only if you don't want it to
Teethshifting isn't shitty at all, woulda saved me $10k
But where did the toast come from? 
Who hurt you?
Yeah but the fertilizer is expensive as shit
Receptionists are the gateway to everything and everyone. Be nice to receptionists
God invented funnels for a reason
Shit, mate, I'd take 10 bucks now and be happy I don't have to starve myself for another few days.
Bidet? Don't mind if I bidoo.
>you see rainbows and Haribo for the first time.  That's how I feel about my new found bowel movements.If those are sugar-free Haribo, he'll be feeling those new-found bowel movements all right.
If it works, it's really Holy Shit
What's your daily intake of fiber?
Its like poetry
Unless you're always down on your hands and knees picking up loose change, and end up getting kicked in the teeth anyway.
You shall be called Sir douchebag, the dragon born.
There are three types of rimshots: one where you hit the rim and the skin at the same time, another where you put one end of the stick on the skin and then hit the rim, and for the third you put the stick on both skin and rim and hit it with another stick.  
>Don't let your spine misalign whilst in line - get America Online!goddamn
That's a really lovely thing to say
$2 for a years worth of inconvenience?! Even if that isn't your property it's still your throne. Just poo it!
the growing is NON-STOP
How do you measure? I start at the tip and stop until I reach a number that I'm comfortable with.
Makes me sad when a good comment is ruined by edits
Every fucking time he said.
Can confirm, the people behind you in line are probably much more annoyed by it.Looking at you, old lady who still uses checks, didn't even bother to write out part of the check ahead of time, and writes as slowly as is humanly fucking possible.
My credit union has a mechanical change sorter. It gives you a receipt to take to the teller, and that much gets deposited into your account. No fee if you're a member!
>The side the little nozzle of the tiny gas pump icon is on is *not* an indicator of which side it's onWell if it's there, it shouldn't be on the *wrong* side, that's just ridiculous and bad planning :humph:
Yeah, you try douching yourself with queso everytime you go to wipe.  After that, everytime you fart you'd literally be cutting the cheese.
One person would just shit their pants seven times in a row. Think about the pain that would cause.You monster.
Given /u/AlienVoice lives somewhere like London with a population density of 1510 per square kilometre then there is roughly a 1 in 12,140 chance of it being them. I think that's pretty decent odds.However if you're out camping or something then you're in for a shitty time.
Still better than spending the night crying in a ball of pain on the bathroom floor waiting to puke again. (Me, age 13-23, until I went on birth control.) I would literally rather die than go back to that.
Anyway, what was the scandal at your high school?
Doesn't look like anything to me
Hey, I'm American and awake.WAKE UP PEOPLE 
You monster. 
Fuck America great again.
I went for a wiz in a coffee shop restroom while waiting for my friends, and my cap fell out of my coat pocket and into the toilet *while i was peeing*. Had to fish it out by grabbing a dry bit, and put it in the sanitary towel bin. My friends arrived to meet me, and one of them left their wet cap beside the table (it was raining heavily outside).I recounted my story, and when one friend said "What did you do with your cap?" i grabbed my other buddy's wet cap from the floor and handed it to the first guy. *"I fished it out"* i said. Dude nearly gagged.
Yes, and probably bloodier. Lots more fighting and power struggle. 
Just to clarify a bit, the kid started rejecting speaking or listening to klingon, so the dad switched back to english.
Or buy one that's 1/2 an inch bigger. 
If someone's selling one on the market every week, it'll drop below 10k pretty quick.
The tripod of pleasure. 
Exxxtra Virgin
It adds character
Woah, Black Betty.
Every third bullet fired in the world then. You could get extremely lucky and have every one ever fired at you be useless, have it never work at all in a meaningful way, or somewhere in between 
Double dang!
Hallowed be thy funnel
If you have a paypal or something I'll send you 10$ right now. I'm pretty broke but I'm not "10$ will keep me from starving" broke.
I don't know why this is making me laugh so much.
Sugar free haribo and metamucil would have an epic battle over bowel movement consistency, in you.
Around 250 Megabytes, give or take.
But then you get paid out by the tooth fairy. I fail to see how you could go wrong?

Fus ro pffffft 
A year in which I sit on the loo twice a week at most. I think you're vastly overestimating the size of this inconvenience, I literally picked the smallest flaw in my apartment. That loo seat will still outlive most of our society
Tip to asshole
doubling your dick size seems like too much to ask for.
If it misses, you're totally being watched. If it goes in, who knows. Could've just gotten a lucky shot. Better throw 10 more to be sure.
Long ago when I worked at a grocery store, I asked a customer why she chose to use checks. She proceeded to fucking complain to management about me after I finished with her.Excuse me for trying to understand the benefits of using checks.
My bank has a machine that takes your change and deposits it into your bank account if you log into the counting machine first.
Hay fever kicking in.
I have no other symptoms of PCOS besides that heavy bleeding. I've been on four different types of birth control and my PCOS powers through like a champ. Now that i'm off birth control due to my slightly higher than normal blood pressure, I get depressed, have regular cramping AND a heavy flow. Plus I can get pregnant with unprotected sex. Lose/lose all around
It depends, what's something the opposite gender does that you think is weird?
these violent delights have violent ends 
Make fuck great again.
This guy fucks. 
Not really, there are plenty for sale now, and it's not creating more supply, just shifting the ownership around. And the guy I responded to was talking about moving around the country to find new cars, so that would spread out the effect even more so. 
You'll be the charming hobo everyone knows enough to smile at, but never stop for.
Plus, depending on where you live, you'll probably never have a bullet fired at you anyway.
Double dung
With surplus rum, I will be drunk, on turps as I am on bourbon.
Thanks for the offer, but I wouldn't accept it even if you did.My mess to get through.
It reminds me of this joke: What's the difference between Dubai and Abu Dhabi? People in Dubai don't like the Flintstones, but people in Abu Dhabi doooooo  
I took a laxative and a stool hardener and they're really fighting it out in there! 
This guy only poops twice a week?! Or mostly poops at work...Twice a week *at most* . Wat?
*tips asshole*
I can't get the measuring tape over my head without it snapping out and rewinding, and also how do I clean a shit streak off my back? 
You can make a payment with no money I your account. Checks take 3 days to clear a bank. They can even bounce and then you didn't pay at all but you still have the food and now you're 3 days away.
As someone who also is a mental health cluster fuck who thought they had narcolepsy, get a sleep study.  Turns out I have sleep apnea, and the lack of good sleep resulted in narcolepsy symptoms. Tall,  slender,  fit, female.The doctor was a skeptical dismissive asshole when I showed up because I met zero typical criteria.  But when it came to diagnosis time, he was all proud to tell his med student doing observation that not all patients present with typical appearances.  
Make America great fuck
Give us this day our daily Mead and forgive us all tresspasses as we did not see that this was not our own home...
I respect that.
As someone who is living in Abu Dhabi at the moment, this is my go to joke. love it! thanks for making me laugh.
**Edit7:** Wowee a second gold!?!? thanks stranger!!!
it doesn't always work like this anymore. a lot of places process your checks electronically right then and there like a debit card transaction. 
Great America, make fuck?
Think of the sound that would make as he walked around.  Like swishing a beaded curtain.
And lead us not into DUI checkpoints, but deliver us from hipsters. Amen.
Just gild him $10 worth. Then he'll still have had someone waste $10 on him, and he doesn't get to use the money. 
Please tell us, have you seen Nermal anywhere?
Shia Lebeouf
Can confirm. If they run your check through the little machine at the register it was just turned into an electronic transaction like a debit card.  Even if they don't do it right there in front of you it is pretty rare any more to have a few days before your account is debited.
And why is it "eugenics would be cool?"
Did he just say "making fuck?"
Found the Shitty Genie.
As opposed to the more confident Lebeouf
Had those machines for 20years in Australia but don't debit the account. They send the details to a clearing house who insure the check on the spot. It will reject checks not based on account balance but based on a record of passing a bad check or if the checkbook had been reported stolen.
They call the Magical Bum homeless. What they don't know? The world is his home.
My sister and I both had this before. It is often unprovoked, and a rare occurrence. We just blink, and wham our vision is 20/20. Then we blink too soon and it's over. I remember grocery shopping with my mother once when I was about 13, and I blinked and suddenly had perfect vision. I saw everything clearly and could read all the labeled sections in the back. I blinked and everything was blurry again. I was amazed and also extremely disappointed that it disappeared so quickly. 
He probably realized what it was and didn't want to get taken to crow court.
Sounds like some messed up version of Over The Hedge
Something similar happened to me. I was 5-6 and was playing outside with other kids. All of a sudden, those two cars stop by a sidewalk, they grab a girl on a tricycle and speed off. Only her bike was left. We ran to my mom to tell her someone got kidnapped. She was cooking, somewhat listened, nodded her head, smiled, "Oh, really?" and that was it. I think about it often. 
It seems you have the grim. 
could have been the colour of your shirt as well.i work at an aquarium, and as someone who wears the uniform, animals get thrilled at the sight of me often, just because of my shirt colour.
Lizarus of Bethany
And behind them was Sisqo's tour bus.
You need to name it, man
Our house was struck by lightening one night and my mom says she saw a hovering ball of lightning. Apparently it's something that can happen.
You probably touched a Brugmansia. They are loaded with scopolamine and can cause you to see things that are not there. Inverse colors are a common hallucination from them. Brugmansia are a very common garden flower, despite their effects, because only small children will be effected by contact alone. Did you have big orange flowers that hang downwards in your garden?
Abraham Lncoln Edt: Thank you knd stranger!
You should talk to the other guy with the post about doing his ashtray in the kitchen and never finding it even after a remodel
Wait what do you mean exactly? Like you fell in such a way that your pants slipped down and your back twisted over? Or you like, saw a vision of your buttcrack appear before you?
Could have been a Will-O'-Wisp especially if it was over a lake. The theory is certain gases like methane and phosphine are either ignited by lightning or chemically react and release light creating what looks like a floating light.
Can confirm. Saw it too. I was being babysat at an uncles house and he had a Super Nintendo that I desperately wanted to play, but he insisted on watching sports. I distinctly remember hearing that quote. 
I was walking to class and passed by a trashcan with a domed lid. On top was a bottom piece of a bun. As was walking by it, a squirrel came out of the trash can and put a Chick-fil-A chicken on top of the bun, then went back inside the trashcan. I assume it was to get the top bun. I really wish I took a photo of it.Another instance was a squirrel with a cigarette butt in its mouth.
As someone who lives in Asia. This isn't too hard to belive.
Coldcut welding.

Woman was probably polishing shafts down there
We (people in southern Appalachia) call that a Crow Court. I've seen it happen too, just with one in the middle. While it definitely does happen, apparently no-one knows why. We all know that corvids are crazy smart, so I think the idea of a Crow Court isn't far off. Maybe the crows in the middle did something to endanger the Murder, or they're sick or something. Either way it really is surreal
That is neat. I can't come close, but, in around 2001 I was playing online poker (hold 'em) on dialup. I'd been dealt AK suited, played it moderate cool, then the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection dropped, and by the time I got back online I'd been timed out and we were on the next hand. It took all I could muster to not put my monitor through.That was the end of online poker for me, but over the last sixteen years of casual kitchen table games I've never seen it since.
A driver in my hometown (suburban NJ) saw a giraffe run across his path. He immediately pulled over for a cup of coffee, and told people he thought he was hallucinating. They tried to call him an ambulance, but then they saw police cars going by... turns out the circus was in town and had lost its giraffe. 
You obvious that you did not see any old businessman, but THE businessman from which all other businessmen are born.

Are you in North Kansas city? Theres a guy in my girlfriends neighborhood that dresses up in a civil war uniform 3 or so times a week and walks his dogs. We finally saw him walk past her house the other day. Very strange, we even Googled to see if there were any reenactments near by but found nothing. He's a doctor of some sort so I suppose he just has a passion or heavy interest in that sort of thing and has the money to make or buy those uniforms.
No, it was me. 
That could've been the start to a real touching Rom-com or maybe even a drama, but you fucked it up.  
> This guys feet were as long as a pillowI love this comparison
If a creepy TV ghost mouthed the word "Floppydlop," I would not stop laughing.
Sounds like ball lightning
Here in Japan there is an urban legend about human-faced dogs called "Jinmenken". They are said to appear running along highways at night and have the ability to talk.
This one I can imagine is legit. Just not real. I used to get very real hallucinations right as I was waking up. 99.9% of the time it was seeing a spider or spiders climb up a wall or across the ceiling. Like, huge spiders. Sometimes bigger than could ever exist in nature. I used to go literally flying out of the bed, scared outta my mind (huge arachnophobe). But then one day I stared at one, too afraid to move, and it slowly faded away as it crawled. Still happens once in a while now- I just ignore it until it goes away. Anyway, it seems very similar to what you described.
My wife and I were in the dinning room and the dog was next to us hoping for scraps.  Then suddenly the bedroom door opened and slammed.  The dog immediately ran up the steps towards the door, just as I did.  I searched the upstairs thinking someone was in the house but no one was there.  What's interesting is we both (wife and I) heard the door knob turn as the door opened.  Clearly the dog heard it too.   It was also on a calm day, no wind and our house has no drafts.  
should have asked for a few 20s
Or would you rather fight 100 rabbit-sized deer?
Most likely a penis that looked like snoop dog to be honest.
My cat went to our neighbour's flowerbed. He was a roamer, so I can imagine that he'd been there before, but I remember him hiding under our rhubarb plant and meowing sadly a few hours before that. Poor baby.
Wherever you are, Magical Bum, we love you.
I will defend any dog in crow court, I'm very educated in _bird law_
"Uh... so what do we do now?" "Letting me go IS an option." "Fine~ Not like anyone will believe this anyway."
No, never heard anything afterwards. That's why I've been wondering whether this was real or just my imagination. On the other hand, other kids were with me and all saw it. 
I once wore a maroon shirt to a zoo whose uniforms were maroon. I attracted the animals everywhere I went. This is probably the right answer.
There's historical accounts of some of them lasting for several minutes and moving around doing all kinds of weird stuff, from boiling water in a nearby bucket to devastating explosions. Observing them out in the open like in OP's story is quite risky, you're much better off staying inside the car when it comes to lightning.
I just googled it and you're right, not a chameleon. I think it was an Anole. 
Followed by dump trucks.
I think humans reserved that name a while back. 
In Hawaii? 
Yeah, its called ball lightning. It can pass through windows, and is SCARY SHIT.
It's just crazy that Ball Lightning is so rare and has barely been recorded that as a 10 year old I witnessed it. Just did some very quick research and it was first recorded only 3 years ago (?) and we still dont even fully understand it.
Brugmansia are terrifying! Not two days ago I read a "trip report" about some dude who took Brugmansia tea he made out of TWO LEAVES *AND* TWO FLOWERS (one leaf per 32oz+ of water is MORE than enough), and the guy ended up crashing knee-first through a plate glass window and then ripped the back door to his house off its hinges with his own two hands. Shit is terrifying.
And it was a Shiny, too! What a missed opportunity.
That's a chalk line. Sounds better than someone catching him and spray painting him which is what I first thought. 
His buttcrack flashed before his eyes.
Lights. Curtains. Close thread. 
Literally swamp gas?
I have a cousin who lives in Kentucky that has a petting zoo.  She has a kangaroo, an alpaca, a camel, and various other animals you'd not normally see in Kentucky.  She's brought the kangaroo with her to family reunions a couple of times.
The real question here is who threw away a whole Chik-fil-A sandwich?
Oh Damn. Its 1:30 am here and while I was reading the last sentence my dad started shouting in his dream. Almost shat myself. Almost. Phew.  
He sleight-of-handed himself
He was fishing with mates. They saw him go overboard. 
Crow mob justice 
Me too. The picture of cows laying on their backs, trying to defend themselves with their feet was also very absurd.
Yeah but this breaks rule 3 and four.Only two crows to a fight and only one fight at a time.
"for the watch"
> the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection droppedThis just sounds deliberate on someone's part.
And his profession? Business.
Why would they not believe you seeing a raccoon? 
There's also lots of small, barely-regulated zoos in Appalachia. It's far from certain that they'd report something like that.

I'm no liquidologist, but if you had two very viscous liquids, the less dense of the two being black, and you poured the white liquid on top of the black liquid, I figure this could happen.
Fences you can impale things on usually are. 
No worries mothbro, hope you got home safe
Sorry Tim.  Some advice, kick your heels off when you're walking down the street at 3am with a few drinks in ya.  That way I'm less likely to notice you swaying.
There's a *LOT* more to the story of that day, this is just a quick summary of the last minute or so.  It was very very very surreal.  I have no idea if my brain was forcing me to see things a certain way or if it was very supernatural.  
The other is Southern California. I woke up to one 15 feet away while backpacking in Cespi. They are massive!
I lived in Korea for a few years and the road to my house was rice paddies and fields and some forest. One time I was driving home late, and out of the forest stepped an old woman with long white hair, wearing white traditional korean farmers clothes. My headlights landed just as she stepped out. I floored it around her and headed home. No one believed me. 3 years later I saw her walking down tne street in the same clothes and a few friends were with me and we had a good laugh. I really thought Id seen a ghost. I feel pretty bad for speeding past her at 10pm now.
Nah, it's He Who Walks Behind the Rows.
And so soon after the cue ball? Dammit, quantum tunneling. ~~Your~~ You're supposed to be statistically impossible.
Nah, one sock
Yes. Also the kitchen was recently redone and it still never turned up. 
It's probably an open secret, or like, secret from the kids or something. My friend who used to smoke would always tell her then-4yo kid, "Mommy's just going outside for some fresh air." 
Not from KC, but I live on that side of the state. You sure it's a civil war uniform? There's a fort around that area that does a living history thing. He could volunteer there, or he could volunteer at a museum or in Lecompton. That area, especially Lawrence has a pretty deep, significant history in the civil war as well as in the territorial era.
From the context, he might have meant "spirit" (autocorrect?)"Sprite" is another word for a fairy or elf-like creature. Unless he's actually talking about one of those somehow dressed in prison guard garb, I'm going to go with the misspelling theory.
Or at least photoshop a squirrels head in a buff kangaroo with a buffalo wing.
Perhaps they meant Project Blue Beam
> Neither of us have seen anything like it before or since, have since moved away and the topic doesn't come up much. But once you mention "New Mexico", everyone thinks it's a joke anyway.I don't think New Mexico has aliens, but it is where they developed the Atomic Bomb and there's still tons of rocket scientists and military people out there. Who knows what's going on at Los Alamos. 
More like a horror. OP wouldn't be living to tell this story if he decided to fuck with whatever freaky ghost bitch decided to join him. He did the right thing. 
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.
Oh. Even the laughter of a 3 year old at 3am is terrifying. 
No way, that's still terrifying
That one made me fucking laugh bud
>When I was a little kidYou are now on a list.
Same! I was walking through my house and it just hit me like I walked through a cloud of my grandmas perfume. It was so distinct, I hadn't smelled that smell in years but I knew exactly what it was. It wasn't scary or anything, it was just super comforting, and then it was gone. I really hope it happens again one day.
Thanks for the nightmare fuel, Japan.
Yeah I get that, only it's always the shape of a person I see.Doesn't even end up being shadows, just a blank wall my mind somehow generated an intruder on. 
oh my god, just picturing my little cat doing that breaks my heart. must've been really tough for you.
Oh, *really*? Let's say you and I go *toe-to-toe* on bird law and see who comes out the victor?
LPT: when going to the zoo, where the same color shirt as the staff uniforms
Yeah anoles are pretty jumpy! Most reptiles are cold-blooded and need warm weather to survive. If they get too cold, they can go into a sleep state or die. I don't think one would survive weeks in hibernation, but it is possible that another anoles got stuck in the snow before you discovered it and warmed it up. Anoles can survive weeks brumating, but I don't think they could go for so long at freezing temperatures.
/r/unexpecteddad
Yes! More specifically on Maui.
Ball lighting chasing some teenagers through some woods could make a good low budget movie.
Got a link? Sounds crazy. 
Nah, shiny mice are green. This was clearly a sonic sighting. It's easy to mistake a hedgehog for a mouse at those speeds.
My dad used to do that to vermin. He had a live trap, and if he caught one, he'd spray-paint it bright yellow and release it on the back edge of our property. If he caught it again, he'd drown it.No idea why he thought rodents deserve a two-strike policy.
Did you ever ask him if he actually know what was happening? Or was it just in case it was your granma coming to tell you guys to go to bed? 
He gave himself a mooning
I really admire your dedication.
Kentucky Down Under? I took a field trip there in elementary school.
I think it just depends on whether the feed is scrambled. Most of it is these days :(
I did that once. It was a stressful day and I just wanted to enjoy a spicy Chicken sandwich. The bag broke which ruined the fries I was really looking forward to so I was already pretty upset. Then the first bite into the sandwich was that weird chewy feeling where maybe there's a tendon or something* that your teeth can't bite through and it grossed me out so I quit and gave up on the treat I bought myself. Just wanted to vent about that
From northwestern Iowa. We get a cougar every couple years wandering through neighborhoods. Last one they killed in front of a school bus.

Holy shit, maybe you missed some follow up story or something?

At the end of the day, you win some, I win some.I think I've made myself perfectly redundant.
Yea whoever was hosting the site lol I have no doubt online game have security like that in place. Like playing online slots on bovada.

Heck, it might've just been out for a walk and decided to pull a prank before heading home. If it was there in the morning, the zoo would never know.
Or perhaps 3 What's New Pussycats, and it's just a really long song.
Also if there was some reactive contaminant in the mixing vessel...which he probably wouldn't have known of.
What else happened? If you don't mind sharing, of course. 
I feel like with the amount of picks I have purchased throughout the years, my bedroom floor would be covered in them. But I can't find a damned one of them. 
Right into the black hole that cars have next to their seats huh?
Where do you guys live? I want to make sure I never go there.

I mean, Area 51 (Groom Lake) is real. It's a facility for developing and testing advanced aircraft.
Do we really have to assume that all ghosts are murdering assholes? Why cant they just be chilling watching game of thrones with us once in a while.
I know right? Not even to try to figure it out or anything, just to have a cool story to tell. I wish I had weird/cool life events like that to tell others. My go-to "interesting story" I tell others is about the time I tripped while running down the stairs and sprained my ankle for a week. I would trade my sprained ankle story for freaky doppelganger story in a heartbeat. 
Like I wasn't before.
Just enjoy all the people asking you where the bathrooms are.  Animals aren't the only ones trained by shirt color.  
Why is this not a thing
I saw ball lightning one morning while I was on an exercise walk through a cemetery.  Scarier than shit.  Fortunately I wasn't alone. Just before Dawn.
I was reading through like damn this sounds kinda cool maybe I'll tr-oke nevermind maybe we'll leave chowing down on hallucinogenic garden plants for another day...
Can one of you draw? A drawing would be nice, since there isn't a photo. 
Yeah. He knew. I was young and didn't know much about them. Just knew I should be afraid of them. Smell of rotting meat can be a sign that one is near. He knew this and reacted. The smell lingered for about ten mins then went away. Followed by dogs barking like crazy again. 
We have unscramblers galore in Bolivia. They even get monthly updates to keep up with the new codes. Pretty sure you can do that with UK signals, too. It's obviously illegal, though. 
That's okay, I lose my appetite when I hit those chewy spots too. Sorry your treat didn't work out.
I'm pretty sure they're just trying to deny it to keep peace since it's getting pretty close to the actual town. No darker conspiracy.

These crows aint loyal
Yeah he was REALLY into jury duty
My imagination says that last crow pecking at the already dead crow was the grieving mother of a baby crow killed by the said crow. 
Cherish it. When I was a kid my sister accidentally let the parrot out of the house. Within seconds a murder of crows tore him up. As if they had been waiting. They didn't posture, no preamble, didn't try to eat him, they just killed him and flew away. Seconds. Crows are savage

My mom always tells me that when I was born she thought I was abducted by aliens.
Because it's hardly unexpected to find dad jokes on reddit.
That's fucking terrifying 
Filibuster! 
Shit like that is more common than people realize. Alien abduction is a little extreme. But post-partum depression can fuck a woman up. Sometimes they can't rationalize why they aren't enamoured with the new baby, and instead feeling all these terrible feelings. Many consider, and some conclude (pathologically), that this is not their baby. Usual explanation they come up with is an innocent mistake by a nurse. But with hospitals today it's extremely unlikely. And with DNA testing and all, easily verifiable.
Or faked his own death and took on a new identity to start a new life?
Thanks, very much appreciated.  11 years goes by quickly, and while I miss her as much today as that day, it does turn into the "new" normal and you stop hating the world.  Hopefully some random redditer runs across the story when they've got a lot of grief and it brings them some comfort too.
Now there's something I haven't thought of in a while. 
Maybe he's on Reddit.  Didn't that one guy who did an AMA say he faked his death from a boating accident 
Blackbriar
That seems somewhat fraudulent...
My sister was asked to go on jerry springer by a coworker, but she declined. It was the episode where a man was dating a woman who turned out to be transgender. Not sure what my sister's role was supposed to be. 
My favorite is the episode (no idea which of the ghost shows it was) where they hear this wheeze. Most of the show was them freaking out about them. Come to find out it's a really fat cat just chilling on a bed upstairs with a breathing problem. It was pretty funny.
I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally, that's literally fiction...
Someone did AMA about American version of this. He said he had to end up selling the car to cover maintenance expenses.On mobile so can't find the exact URL.
They piece together the narrative for these based on fan reactions. Social media is probably more responsible for keeping reality TV going than almost anything else.They don't like the fact that that BITCH Alison is somehow still getting all the attention from Tyler? Let's work with that, and make it so that she's actively manipulating him and really doesn't care.
"...we already agreed what it would look like after its done.""I know but at least act more surprised!"
Can confirm, Survivor is some real shit. I had a lecturer who used to be part of the medic team. People got hurt pretty often, although it was usually the crew, since there's a lot more of them. But exhaustion was a big part of the cast's issues.He also watched a fellow cast member drown, while on an expedition/day off on one of the islands. Those islands can be genuinely dangerous places.
Everyone seems to know a guy.
I'm just sitting here in this alley smoking Meth and next thing I know this 7 foot tall gorilla of a man and a skinny dude holding a bright camera are yelling at me. I start running and next thing I know the gorilla is on top of me, I'm sweating and bleeding from my forehead.
My friend was one of the rubbish acts. He knew he was awful, the producers knew he was awful. He was only putting on a character for a laugh. He got called back for the novelty "shit act ensemble" at the end of the season.Also, this is why so many people come out with shit like "I quit work to be here!" and are devastated when they don't go through, the fact that they've got through the untelevised rounds already has gotten their hopes up.
Even as a viewer, I've reacted to that. They do a lot of stuff that looks good, but they don't do anything to the bits that keeps it running and safe.
High attitude chamber sounds horrific.
"Wait, wait, can we try that entrance again? I don't think I seemed surprised enough."
A month ago Reddit told that the show was filmed in a recreated studio, due to laws pertaining to the filming inside pawn shops. Anyone know the truth?
My fraternity helped in a build of a house for that show here in our town. Can confirm, Ty is a dick. He just acts like he's god's gift to the world, and that he's too good to talk to you. Also, he doesn't do jack shit towards the build, they go off kind of like a Habitat for Humanity build. It was still a cool experience. 
> go to sleep around 11pm only to get woken up at 2am to film again to make them more irritableIs that why most looked dead inside?
They clear out the store for filming and select people from the line outside to be extras during filmed sequences. Almost all of the items brought in are prearranged. 
What they mean is that he's not outrageously attractive but also not deformed enough to have a good sob story. Perfectly average just won't cut it.
There's videos on YouTube showing them getting recognized during filming. I'm sure it's harder for them to film segments now. 
I wonder as well.  Some of those kids are ripping the carpet up and poking holes in the drywall.  Some lady comes by with a chalkboard and makes them do chores.  All the sudden they are angel and can't stand to see them go.  And the parents are incompetent boobs who become parents of the year by the nanny reminding them that their kid needs a hug sometimes.  
I had two friends on the show. There was a lot of disappointing issues with the way the show was made. They were very restricted in what they could do. Like not being allowed to go over that hill where all the edible plants are, or failures making it into the show, but not showing when they actually succeeded in getting a fish. Basically, the survival was real, but they were set up to suffer. And of course the editing filled in when needed for the "story".  Also knew a guy on Dual Survival. It seemed pretty genuine, but there were definitely moments where you could tell something was up.  
In this case the word "somewhat" means quite likely.  Maybe they said a few weeks thinking OP would be back in like 2 weeks but OP returned like 4-5 weeks later, idk
One of my highschool friends who is trans ended up doing a Springer show where they did this whole "I'm a man" reveal to their boyfriend. They had never met before.
My husband worked for two years as a tour guide at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.  It was haunted alright - by bats, cats and rats.  Never quiet, always something going on among the furry residents.  He did a show in the rotunda, and the audience was dive-bombed by bats and a feral cat kept knocking over the props.  We were both there many nights locking up by ourselves, and it was damned noisy for a deserted prison....but of course the other employees blamed "ghosts" or "spirits". 
My favorite for this is Destination Truth. The host is an archaeologist and part of the Adventurer's Club. He does another show on the travel channel now that's a little less outlandish in what's being investigated, but with both shows they go into pretty nice detail about the areas they're visiting and some of the customs of the local people.
Or more likely an undercover cop.
Haha for realz. To avoid that pitfall, the producer gave us an address that avoided highways 
When you get into the cab, they give you a rundown on the rules, and you'd be free to say "no thanks" and not ride anywhere.  But it seems fun, so I'd do it.I'd be annoyed at being hungry though.  There's no reason they had to tell to eat less at lunch.
> I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally do, that's literally fiction...Nah, don't you know? It's "REALITY" tv!
Not sure if it's true, but I heard they have that clause more in case they need to, but it's not something they actually use.ie- they find out a contestant is a convicted rapist, they can just vote him off the show without worrying that a convicted rapist will win the grand prize. 
There is no escape from the Bill Wurtz memes.
There's a few times (never aired of course) where the person came home and went apeshit that their house had been violated and that everyone had to put it back how it was otherwise lawyers, etc..
Wouldn't surprise me. Lord knows if that happened to me, and I was unaware of it beforehand, I'd sue. I like my furniture thank you very much.
"When I say 'Hello, Mr Thompson' and press down on your foot, you smile and nod."
It's completely random from what he told me, his tattoo really doesn't suit is personality and it's fading like crazy already, a lot of people say the tattoos they got done weren't done to a very high standard ie. not deep enough in the skin etc 
Are  you saying that all reality shows should have their characters replaced by pregnant 16 year olds?Survivor just got *way* more interesting
people like to look at nice houses I guess
The way it works here (in Georgia) is, as long as you don't sell it, or make an obnoxious amount that you MUST be selling, it's legal. But they payed it off as being totally illegal to even make it. And yes, we do have some "back water, back woods" stills, I got one myself, but that is just for fun and tradition. The good stuff is made in stainless steal vats, refined several times, and in a controlled condition like a storage shed or someones garage. The show was just all about getting ratings by pushing some ignorant stereotypes. 
I was on my phone and couldn't be bothered googling. Took a punt on the auto-correct. Totally wrong.Better change it before this hits front page and my inbox gets flooded with corrections. 
A restaurant I used to work for catered live celebrity chef events. Several of them were winners of Top Chef or various Food Network cast members (not the big names, but members of the teams that swoop in to help). They would send our owner a signature  recipe in advance, he would show up with one of his chefs and while the Celebrity Chef was making one serving of their dish out on stage to demonstrate the two of them would bust ass and make a few hundred copies to serve to the audience once the demonstration was over. 
And his ole mate olive oil. 
I was watching some American survivor like show and one of the guys who initially scouted out the island got bit by an extremely poisonous snake and had his flesh on his leg destroyed. 
> Koh LantaHa!
*tips hat*
That is a great question.  We outside performers just went home after filming.  I bet they did stay together though, just not same bed.
"I know a guy who's a specialist in Napoleonic-era French enema kits, lemme give him a call."
I'm pretty sure my uncle was asked if he wanted to be in the show by his friend. As for the item, I don't think he ever told me the part about where it came from.
I know that for Fixer Upper, they use a bunch of stuff from Chip and Joanna's stores.  The people are given a price to buy the staged items if they really love them, but otherwise it gets pulled and goes back into the stores.
Best episode of cops was"I'll get you bitch"or that episode where that lady was so angry at her husband she takes out scissors and starts cutting everything in their house.  Even her hair.
"I'm wearing boots of escaping! I'm wearing boots of escaping!" 
I'm glad he knew, I always felt bad for the shit acts because I thought they all believed they were good when they were basically being asked back for the public humiliation.
Kind of. You've got to be either really great or if you're terrible you've got to be a character.Kevin Smith, the fresh faced graduate who is terrible, isn't going to get anywhere near the judges auditions. Whereas, Colin Jones, the 56 year old plumber who's got a secret love for Spice Girls songs and is also terrible, is more likely to go through. It is an entertainment show after all.
thats weird that just because he works for a company hes considered property of disney.
We had Natasha Raskin as our presenter, Dickinson was varnishing himself up elsewhere.
Not always.  A few people got lucky enough to have some decently impressive engines installed 
wtf yer a car and a person??
Pretty sure thats because you were in the target demographic. Doubt many 40 year Olds were watching that like "I'd be so cool bringing that to the office on Monday." 
They are *really* experts at preventing this kind of thing from happening. I have heard stories of people on big brother where the staff was trying to push them to trash talk on other people and they would ask the most horrid manipulative leading questions and when they tried to refuse, they held up their contract and threatened to sue them for not cooperating.
$20,000 buys a lot of camo and cowboy boots...
I thought so too which is why I had my feelings hurt when I realized what show she was actually talking about. Because of the nature of the show it felt more like she thought my clothes themselves were tacky, not that she thought punk/goth/whatevers should dress more normal. One thing I noticed living in LA though is you almost never see anyone dressing alternatively, no dyed hair, no piercings, which is a lot different than I expected before moving there. So what to me was just a normal outfit was probably a lot different to her. 
Haha I actually have a feeling that might have been how it went down. I assume most people put together their worst outfit for the interview but I still had some self respect so I put on something I'd actually wear. I think if I had a pic everyone would agree it looked alright -- just looked like a movie assassin outfit or something. Woot let our spines fuse together! Ha pun. AS power. 
>can we try that entrance again?Why don't you take a seat over there... 
I've actually thought about how funny it would be if they show the guy getting taken down after he walks out the front door, and then it cuts back to Hansen just unwrapping the happy meal the guy brought with him. 
I went there a couple years ago. There is the pawn shop where you could buy stuff like a normal pawn shop. Apparently, the Pawn "Stars" come out sometimes to interact with people, but not very often.  One of the workers told us there was another shop they did the actual filming at. 
Everybody that appears on Pawn Stars has to apply and have their inventory pre-examined for authenticity.  It's not like random people bring in that kind of stuff. They also pick people with stuff that isn't real, to try to make the show seem authentic.
Adam Carolla actually called him out as being a fake. Asked him questions a real carpenter should know. It didnt go well, Ty is a phony.
Oh yeah. Plus the family was fairly wealthy and totally didn't need to be rescued. Meanwhile my friend's dad's house was still flattened.
You can, but local noise ordinances apply. Of course you can do whatever you want if no one enforces the laws or you bribe the neighbors. 
I've heard stories like that happening as well as of families who pretty obviously have zero money management skills suddenly get a house free and clear, worth much more than their old one. They mortgage it, waste the money, and get foreclosed. So all that charity work and good feels gone because the family ends up where they were heading in the first place. Another favorite is I've read people who did Fixer Upper would move out of the house and then list it as an Air BnB or similar since it has that 'star power ' attached to it.
As a chef I can tell you we are all dead inside
Yes, he was the host of the show then. I do not know if that has changed, that was the only season of that show I have ever watched.
Here's your ticket to Paris, you deserve better than this.
Probably about a 2. You sometimes get an actual documentary about animals, but for the most part it's Finding Bigfoot season 23 and Jackson Galaxy Cat Whisperer reruns
...because the ferrets learnt from the dog. It was his plan all along to get famous.
My favourite part was on the show they got all this cool stuff and then as soon as it's over they take a lot of the cool stuff back. 
The terrorists have won.
Was it where she was dressed as a hula girl? I didn't see the whole episode just a clip, I have no idea why she was dressed like a hula girl. 
Josh Gates is definitely in my Top 5 People to Have a Beer With list
But what would dust be doing in a haunted house?!
So are you saying that the cooking show opportunity was false, and that they baited you into cash cab?And that they abandon people hungry and alone and remote as standard operating practice?
Hungry people have a harder time thinking and remembering things.
"Scripted reality", as they actually fucking call it :s
Also on the x factor you usually have to have a sob story 
You could make a religion out of Bill Wurtz memes.
Completely understandable 
Like seriously, who the fuck thinks it's a good idea to redecorate and repaint a person's house without their knowledge or informed consent?I'd be fuckin pissed too, even if it was a quality job. 
It must be "De grote beurt", what a fucking shit show that was.
PSSSSTTT I think he is talking to you!
My husband is a tattooer and I've watched the show. Based on the information I have available to me, this is probably the correct answer 
Survivor would become the prequel to 16 and Pregnant
My husband started off passively "watching" The Bachelor because of me but now he knows all the tropes and can spot which girls or guys will make it to the end and thinks the show is hilarious.
Nah it's just interesting to see what people's houses look like around the world. Same reason neighbors are always snooping during an auction
Oh crap! The real estate market has crashed??! *drops smashed avo on toast*
Exactly this. I know it's fake. I just like to see the different house, pick the one I would like the most and then see how the renovations go.Although nowadays, everything in the US seems to "I want an open concept", with no separation between kitchen, dining and living room. And the kitchen MUST have an island or a peninsula.
Nah, it's cool. I do remember that show. It's hilarious to see that the most cheffy thing Aristos did was go outside and fang durries. 
See I'm kinda more okay with that IF the recipe was made by the CC. I dont think it will be very smart time wise to just have the CC cook for the whole audience
It's part of the Aussie food pyramid.
Naked and afraid
People used to do enemas for medical reasons a lot. Tobacco enemas were a thing in the past.
Nah, hands down it's gotta be that "I can break these cuffs" dude.I was on the edge of my seat when he tried to break those cuffs. Turns out he couldn't break those cuffs.
Nah some of them were just taking the piss.
Everyone and everything is property of Disney. 
Wasn't there one guy who got a brand new car because his old one was Frankensteind from two or three different cars?
I dated a girl that was on a failed USA network reality show "Vanderbilt MDs" where they threw a bunch of medical students into a house and tried to have a Big Brother kind of atmosphere.  She was the cute girl in the bunch and she explained that hey kept trying to feed her alcohol or get her into the hot tub.  However, she grew up in a very conservative household and knew her family would be watching, so she never did anything interesting on the show.  They paid for medical school and her housing!
Yeah it probably went down more like "hey we got a literal potato in a burlap sack down the hall, let's cut the normie loose so we can get lunch."
\*Chris Hansen turns to the crew\* "Hey guys what do you want for lunch? I can message the next perv from the bait account and ask them to bring some fast food."
The show is filmed in the back room with sets that look just like the actual store. I was an extra on it before. They asked us while we were waiting to go inside.
Go on any autograph or memorabilia forum, bring up Pawn Stars and you'll see people complaining about all the fake crap they've bought on that show.
Adam was a contractor so that makes a lot of sense that it'd piss him off for some dude to lie about it on a show. 
You know you've hit rock bottom as a tv personality when you start doing mortgage commercials. 
That's OK, it's probably half made out of cardboard!
Or if the town wants publicity and willing to make a concession for a short period of time as long as the towns name and some of its features are highlighted somewhere in the final broadcast of a show
Noise ordinances aren't enforced based on who's making noise.
We have the same situation in the UK with polish guys. Hardest working people, do such a good job, never complain. And a lot of people regardless still have the same bullshit attitude to them, that they're terrible scrounging immigrants. 
I just want to let you know we appreciate your hard and gruelling work^pls^dont^spit^in^my^food
Ever make your way to the house's interior?
Back when History and Discovery were still decent, Animal Planet was pretty good too.
What seriously
No from what I remember they were all dressed pretty casual/normal. The guy put on this whole disgusted act, but anyone who knows my friend irl or even has them on Facebook knows they're extremely open about their transition. 
Speak for yourself!
He definitely seems like an awesome guy. I imagine just listening to him talk about his adventures would be fun.
Now Luigi's Mansion makes a lot more senseHe was just vacuuming dust
then they film them for survivor NYC

Where's the reality show for this? I'd rather watch this.
Right? What are they expecting? That the person is so overjoyed they completely forgot about all the other things that have been in their daily lives for years?
Pretty sure doing a makeover of someone's house and getting rid of their furniture without the hone owner's notice or permission is very illegal. 
Yeah, if youre gonna fake anything, fake the reactions. Tell them beforehand, have em sign a waiver, then have him fake surprise
It was so bad that it was amazing!
The people on that show, specifically that Sketch guy, are universally hated by the tattoo scene. He also steals designs from other artists. All sorts of controversy about him and this show. 
The woman always need a place to "entertain guests" and the man always needs a "man cave." Or it's just "not authentically [insert current county] enough."
Will it have an open concept floor plan?
I hope you insured that smashed avo...
There's always that one person in the couple that seems to complain about every little thing. "MMMm yeah I dunno bout this caaarpet""Mmmnoot feeling this kiiitchen""Yeeeah this one doesn't have a ocean viewwww"
She also wants to live in the middle of the city but also wants it to be quiet and charming. Her budget is $12 and she also has a sack of potatoes. 
Thats true, but we really have no way of knowing if it was by the CC or not. And they *could* do a large batch recipe and have assistants help plate, but I suppose part of the event is teaching you a recipe to cook for your family in realistic portions, not how to cook for hundreds. 
It *is* the Aussie food pyramid.
Will you be my enema guy? You know, just in case I need one?
That made for good times on YTMND
Yeah. They gave him a new Scion or something that looked like a cube. He had a handicapped brother and some other kids he drove around for his mother. I remember this one pretty well, I felt super bad for this guy. He was pretty young, like 19. He was my son's age and he had a ton of responsibility helping his mom. Seemed like such a sweet kid. 
Behind the scenes: "Now remember, this bad boy puts out 500 BHP, your fiat panda has an original 40 HP, so never EVER floor it""...and the new engine weighs about 300 kgs more than the old one, so technically you can't bring any passengers"
LMAO. "Hey bb, don't forget the lube and condoms. Also, some Wendy's. I need a #2, large, with a Diet Coke. A #6, medium, with a sprite and substitute chili for the fries. A #3 with Sprite. I also need two crispy chicken snack wraps and a 4 piece nugget. And can you do lite ice on the sprite with the #6? Thank bb."
Or payday loan commercials. *Looking at you Montel Williams*.
Look at mr. fancy walls, using cardboard! I built my home out of toilet paper and used McDonalds straws!
Noise ordinances are also probably not enforced when all the houses are flattened in the area.
stereotypes don't help anyone. I worked with poles for years and like any group many were hard working, especially the younger ones. Then I'd go home to my house share with 5 of them, 3 were on benefits and two were incredibly violent alcoholics who I could hear drinking all day and often woke me up belching. They were both women. People are people.
As someone who had a made episode shot at their school and others in the area, this is pretty spot. You basically audition, then whoever is picked they definitely pick a narrative. Without giving too much away there is some definite pushing and prodding of lines and things tonforce a narrative, but nothing too crazy. The work and everything is all real, and the celebrities actually end up fairly involved. Not the worst show by any means. The camera crews weren't super invasive either, they got most of their footage in at set times
Steve irwin's death also killed Animal Planet
In said AMA the dude talked about how for example he had a cool TV put into his car for the show and once his episode was over they took it back. It's kinda funny in the end 
I am ALL dead on this blessed day 
Which is the only reason why anyone watches his show. I don't think anyone actually expects he's going to find the Loch Ness Monster in a 30 minute tv spot.
I'd watch that. 
How about I do, anyway?
"No said everyone"
Trading Spaces used to air the ones where people were pissed. You should look for the purple house episode.
[Redacted]
Honestly, I always thought that's how those shows worked. Surprised that part is actually honest.Guess it's not that complicated when the family is behind it, but still. Doesn't seem like a great idea. 
The whole final season where celebrities would pimp a car and auction it for charity was amazing! I mis that show and its cheesyness.
One of the tattooists from that show is also in a new one as a judge for best british tattoo artist. The guy is nowhere near good enough to be able to judge other people's work. 
You can tell the "fixed" one because it's a gigantic black blob haha 
Sketch is so shit. Jay does pretty good black and grey realism from what they show. Then there's Alice: "I want death jumping a motorcycle over a valley of lava" "Okay so I've drawn this flower..."
God that "man cave" shit has to stop. It's like a virus of cliches invented by a TV show that's spreading to reality. You're not keeping up with the Joneses now unless you have a side room with a 400" tv, a deer head and a beer sign. 
I NEED TO SEE MY KIDS WHILE COOKING OR SO HELP ME GOD
Not always. There was an episode awhile back where the couple ran a catering business. The house they looked at had new metal shelving in the basement with catering supplies on it, a bed in the master bedroom, and landscape material in the backyard. Needless to say, that was the house they "picked" and they had already started moving in. 
The other day I was watching that RV show. There was a new rich kind of couple - the backstory was that he had "sold an app" - that was checking a million dollar RV. While checking the bathroom the wife said "oh, I can't stay here because there is just one bathroom sink. The thought of sharing it makes me want to puke."Wow, just wow.
Even worse is when it's like, "John sells artisan tinfoil hats and Sarah wrote the first paragraph of a novel six months ago. Their budget is $2.5 million."

Shoulda made it out of bidets and straws, uses much less natural resources.
And to be fair, I don't think they should be after a catastrophe like a tornado or a flood. When people are without a roof above their head construction should be allowed to continue 24/7 if you have workers willing to work that long.
Poles are totally random, can confirm, I'm a Pole. 
Killed Steve Irwin, too.
I hope this is only "the stuff we did was not actually street legal so we have to take this out so you're allowed to drive your car" and not "well show's over, pack it up boys"...
"Tryyyyy iittttttt" he said again
That show was terrible.  It was like they were trying to play practical jokes on each other instead of making something nice.  I saw one where they spray painted someones couch.  
I have a 100+ year old piano that's been passed down through my family. I would commit felony assault at the very least if I came home and found it gone/smashed in a dumpster.
Also the ones without identifying shots so that no one tracks them down.

There was one episode where they glued hay on the wall! Literally hay. Can you imagine how gross that would be!? I just imagine dust and allergies like crazy. Plus, how the heck do you remove that?
I'd do it over the 40-year-old sofa.
Just replace your skin with kevlar and you're goodOr become Adam Jensen, but I never asked for this.
Ah yes, the spudometer
It's just a job to him, and the $$ is too good to pass it up. It's not a carpentry show, it's a reality show. His job is just to yak cool-sounding words, converse with people, and act excited/surprised/sympathetic at the right moments. He doesn't give a shit about carpentry. If it was a show like *Holmes on Homes*, where the host is very hands on and does a lot of the work himself while expertly explaining the process...Ty would get fired by the first week. One thing Ty has going for him he probably worked hard on public speaking and how to host shows. Not a complete loss, I guess.

I think your friend might also be my dog.
A few years ago, a friend of a friend called everyone in his contact list and left long, rambling messages. It was how I discovered my friend gave him my number. Fun times.Anyway, he called his best friend - who was my friend's SO - and left 2 full messages crying about how he wanted to live in Middle Earth. Literally sobbing. He had a drunken breakdown because he wanted to be a hobbit.
do you live in new orleans bc i'm pretty sure i said that a few times 
I mean, I've heard much worse drunk logic. 
I hope you didn't let him
He had to confirm the kill.

My friend has a recording of me sulking over a girl years ago and I said, "I'm gonna kill myself in half"

You call that belligerent?
One time I ate pizza that was left on people's plates after they'd left the pizza shop. Apparently I called it "garbage crusts" and I ask for it whenever I'm drunk. So I guess "floor pizza" isn't far off for me

Omg I had this kinda happen to me two years ago but it was pizza by the slice and a guy dropped his slice onto my back (I had a backless dress on so it literally stuck to my back). He apologized profusely and offered to buy me a slice or something, I declined, he just ran out, the cashier said he didn't even pay for his slice that he dropped on me. I paid for it in exchange for the cashier wiping my back for me hahaha

This is the saddest comment of 2017.
Was totally your fault.
My wife does this 2 to 3 times a year, and the way she responds "you do?" is so honest and adorable it makes me remember why I fell in love with her in the first place.On occasion she'll also beg me not to leave the room  because, "you're my friend!" in the exact same tone.

I'm invested in this story, how'd it turn out 
It looks an awful lot like they just pushed the rack back.
My first time in nola I hopped out of the car, walked ten feet down the sidewalk, and saw a guy walking toward me with his pants unbuttoned and penis flopped out, just peeing everywhere.
But he *is* technically correct though. 
I ended up making his taquitos for him
Surprisingly enough his phone is fine. 
That's what I immediately thought of.
I like to think that it's one of those "every square is a rectangle" kind of things. If you're wasted, you're also significantly tipsy, and probably have a heavy buzz going on. Every subsequent level of drunkenness also includes the previous level of drunkenness. It's like building a pyramid, except instead of getting closer to the sky, you get closer to the floor. 
Did you do it?
Three or four shots worth.  That's how I would quantify strength as well.
Yeah she was like, "If you're gonna send a dick pic put a little more effort into it" we were laughing so hard it was so unexpected.
Dude probably has some kinda plumbing related PTSD. I hear shit goes down when you're a plumber.
The dolphins will though. Dolphins are notorious drunks.
Because it's unattended beer in a backpack? That's prime beer stealing territory.
I'm thinking that's how the accent developed in the first place 
As a brit living in the usa, even the Americans I hang out with get bored of hearing me answer the same questions about where I'm from, how long I've been here, why I came in the first place, whether I like it, whether I go back home to visit. The questions are the same every time, and get fucking boring to answer to every waiter, shop attendant, or person that hears me talk. If I could fake an accent successfully I would.
If they can do that with their bare hands it's probably best to just let them keep it
Or maybe just a person who tries hard and believes in himself.
"I know what I'm about and it's standing in camp fires"
For all those times you need to stand in a camp fire!
A guy with fireproof shoes is definitely rocking cargo shorts
Not necessarily it might be like those heat shielding suits. They are fireproof and stays cool on the inside. 
This is why you only do this at someone else's party.
One time I got insanely drunk and started sliding off a chair. In my drunken state I realized what was happening and said, "I'm falling." Unfortunately my fuck account was empty so I slid for an agonizing 1-2 minutes while saying "Nooooooooo" until I finally fell and hit my head on a table.
He said they were stoned, not drunk 
It's a miracle he didn't suceed in selling his scarf with that, honestly.
That's the only way to do it; Uncle knows best.
In my experience as a volcano owner, the volcano is usually the death of the party. Most casual smokers can't really handle it. 
Reminds me of a shroom trip I had where I just texted a bunch of people "What impact have I made in your life?" 
So now you don't have a butt?
60 percent of the time it works every time.   In reality, I saw most females start talking with him then quickly make their retreat. He seemed to be having a great time though. 
When you are drunk enough, the responses come out of you.
I spent way too much time trying to figure out what "k rap" is...
You know, the traditional New Year's bathtub fire.
He just drops 'bathtub fire' like those are two words that go together all the time...
No no, I want to hear first how this wasn't *a* bathtub fire, but *the* bathtub fire. Like this is just how New Years is done there.
Well he was belligerently friendly.
It sounds like a euphemism for something much more exciting

This actually happened to me, on New Years 2012, in Portland. It was a homeless man inquiring. 
Like calling your teacher "mom" and living in silent shame for the rest of the school day. 
i've done that... then tried to correct and the recipient said not to worry. 
1 glass, no problem. 2 glasses, that's funny but I can see it happening. 3 glasses, we all know what's going on here. 
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all life's problems.

They kept playing a cover or Leonard Cohen's hallelujah on the local Christmas station, people realize that's a super sad, not Christmas song, right?
Yes, he was formerly the banker.
It is an otherworldly feeling.
I collected 5 of them, so no worries.  
Sadly, no. It's a human skull so maybe it makes them happy ;).
Hahah,"Everyone, I peed my pants! Great Happy New Year!"
Um can I sign up for that too? If these,are the types of gifts reddit secret Santa does, I'm so in for next year.
He did in fact kiss every person at that party before 12:01 
What kind of phone?
It's not a pyramid scheme. It's more like a funnel. 
Can't remember 
It's not MY fault this is happening
So long and thanks for all the beer
Turns out, there is no actual Scottish accent. Everyone in Scotland is just drunk all the time.
That's what I figured... like.. Merry Christmas to you bud.. enjoy your door
A man who stares at goats
He's a witch burn him!
He's also the sort of guy with no leg hair after standing in so many fires.
I love Frankie Boyle's story of the most Scottish thing he'd ever seen. A drunk guy pishing against the door of a house. He finishes, gives it a shake, puts it away, takes out his keys and opens the door.
It's the car dealership tactic:  First they feed you, then they take your money.

First day of 2017, reddit already stuck in a loop.
That's how traditions are born.
it was probably one of those styrofoam gas station ones
Look at it this way: you took the pressure off of everyone else by being the most drunk one. No one else has to regret anything. They'll just deflect by saying "Yeah, well, what about baenca? Hooooo boy!"
They had the same issue you did and mixed up "piss off" and "don't worry."
Can confirm, have done this and thought the same thing. 
>JyckleNice 
Well, if I stop drinking now I'm afraid that the cumulative hangover will kill me.
You can't trust those corrupt bankers
Not just every single girl. Not even every girl. Every *person*. What a champ. 
Seriously, OP, we all need this answer.
Now I kind of want to see a hieroglyphic of a dude using a beer bong.
You're such a puss, Bill. 
Can season 3 just be out already?!?!
Scottish here. Can confirm. 
He's getting himself a house, one piece at a time.

Ah, the ol' restaurant tactic.
OP delivers. Turns out there were trees involved too
Yeah, who contributed that peice of paper to the stack? 
Demolition expert perk.On second thought, wait.... Demolition amateur
Like "Decoy Snail"
How dare he introduce himself to me 5 times in one night, how rude.
Can't think of a better way of starting 2017.He probably kissed more person in the first minute of 2017 than I will in the whole year.
Even more shocking it was an iPhone. 
and it didn't cost him a dime. You'll know it's him, the shittiest house in town
One of the oldest scams in the book. 
Oh that was Winston Bishop. We call him Prank Sinatra. 
Its a '16, '17, '18, '19, '20, '21, '22 split level ranch.

The Germans were meticulous record keepers, and a lot fell into Allied hands, at the end of WW2.
Anything that serious won't be actually true "declassified". Shit like MKULTRA had to be leaked.
Kudos to the tech who said "Three is good, but four is better"
Do you have any link or the full speech? I would love to read that. I searched around and only found bits of it in articles. 
I think it's called kinetic bombardment. 
If you think they'll declassify any relevant info, I think you'll be in for a shock. 
Why do you think governments are trying to regulate the internet?
They did this in the States as well. Very very disturbing history.
They mentioned this in the Great Train Robbery, that people would leave the factories at night so covered in phosphorous that their clothes would glow in the dark.  Life in early industrial Europe was pure shit.
I read somewhere that the German higher-ups didn't trust their low level workers and soldiers to carry out their orders against the jews thoroughly, so they made them fill out paperwork meticulously, thus that is the reason there is so much documentation of the holocaust. 
The only confederate war prisoners that were executed were the commanders of the prison camps.
the evil experiments they are doing today will still be classified.scary to think what will be posted to a thread like this in 70 years time.
Largely for the same reason, if the US were to nuke Russia it would probably send more than 1 nuke.
You call your hamburgers steamed hams?
I mean, doesn't everyone know that different police forces do this? There's literally a phrase for it: "agent provocateur".
So far?  Only if you're a frog.
For some reason I love the idea of a nuclear powered rocket whose only attack ability is to fly all over the place at Mach 5 breaking shit with shockwaves.
Appropriate for a weapon. 
This could be the cause of the speculation of "Chem-Trails". Well, it's a plane instead of boats of course.
What was crazy to me was the scale. Usually when you hear about these cult communes it's like a handful of people - maybe 100 people if that. This was over 900 people. Over 900 people willingly took their lives for a crazy idea. They also murdered a congressman.
The distorted music does add to the eerieness of the tapes.
I think they'll reclassify it all.  It won't be declassified until everyone who remembers it is dead and it's of historical interest only.
Two is one and one is none 
There was also a nuke accidentally dropped on Mars Bluff, SC back in 1958.
Wait, so it could have been 200 times the size of fat man... fiddily fuck that shit RIGHT off.
From what I can gather nuclear bombs don't detonate by themselves. They need to be triggered. So it just disintigrated on ground impact.Meaning they are not impact sensitive. They get triggered.
I can't believe that we survived so many close calls during the Cold War. It's a miracle that we didn't blow each other to bits.
For most people the thought was "Ok, go to Texas or Mississippi for a long weekend, come back, tarp up the roof and go to work afterwards."  
It was very surreal. I was a senior in high school at the time. Was napping on the couch and woke up to that bulletin. It was too late to go anywhere at that point. 
I was listening to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy today and you reminded me of this. "It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job". - Douglas Adams.
A bad sci-fi author
I feel like this advice might also work in a non-assassination context
The sixth symptom of groupthink is the illusion of morality, in which members participating in the group decision-making process tend to lose sight of their personal moral principles. Rather, belief in the overall morality of the group overrides any individual sense of right and wrong.
You'd pretty much lose all sense of yourself and reality, I can't imagine going through that
So the UnaBomber left Harvard in 1969, and that report was published in 1976. I was too lazy to read it all, but did anyone read it and confirm the unabomber was a victim? That would be some next level shit. If anyone was wondering he's 74 and currently serving 8 life sentences if my Max Payne trivia is on par 
it was mostly about trauma-based mind control.  Torture someone till they break and program them with whatever the fuck you want.  Evil shit, honestly.  I'm pretty sure the conspiracy theorists are right to some degree that kids are being run through this process.  I'm not sure the CIA does it any more but likely something more underground. I don't know.  There is too many terrible things in the world and I can barely stand it some days.
Just "The 4th Kind" and it is a very scary movie. 
Seriously, what's the worst that could happen. Best case scenario you got a new superweapon of people who can look into the office of USSR secretary, realistic case scenario you wasted a time of a few interns
Some odd million years from now some space squid from Europa will be looking at a barren scorched Earth thinking. I wonder what happened there!
There was actually a similar interview on NPR recently (last week or 2 weeks ago). Someone who had been writing a book on some of the CIA's research in psychic phenomenon basically said that yes, the material is crazy to be researching, BUT, when we have the budget and the means to scientifically analyze what's going on, why not just verify. After all, if it turns out all the crazy powers and phenomenon are true, why wouldn't you want to be able to utilize it?
The most fucked up part? His "drug cocktail" to erase memory appeared to have worked. While trying to find victims, only two were found because others asked about it recognized tattoos on the women. When the women were approached they offered to talk to law enforcement but had no recollection of anything even remotely like that. Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.Last Podcast on the Left has a pretty good episode covering this.
Yes, many of his victims were released after he got tired of raping and torturing them.  Before he went in search of a new victim he would typically let the previous one go.
I was not prepared.
Declassified. Its always the act of revealing that is surprising.  Humanity are capable of anything.
"What we're telling them to do is so bad, we don't expect people to do it. So instead of saying 'fuck that, no' we're gonna make them prove that they did it."
Well the atrocities didn't become public for quite some time so many parents didn't know what was happening to their children. IIRC, most were orphaned children or young adults that couldn't take care of themselves because of their disabilities. 
It was directed by an alum of my high school so we watching it in a class and it's honestly a fantastic documentary. They really capture the air of uncertainty around the Crospy case and the feeling of horror that plagued Staten Island while he was on the loose. Chilling is really the best way to describe it. 
If you look at the time line the Tuskegee trials started 2 decades before Willowbrook and lasted almost 3 times as long. I would say Tuskegee is where they hot the idea to do the tests at Willowbrook.  The only thing more disturbing is that they started Willowbrook after the defeat of the Nazis and should have known better.
Good thing they didn't know about the SUNDIAL. 
Yeah this still happens today all over the world.Can't legally arrest peaceful protestors? Then make then violent. Helps with PR too as it makes the protesters less sympathetic. 
It's absolutely not cost-effective
Let's agree not to kill each other's kids.Don't attack clinics or the medics, we both need to help our wounded.Long ago people would trade PoWs back and take breaks at night, in winter, or during holidays.The goal is to keep the battle contained and restrict suffering. Our soldiers fight yours, and if we get a win condition we stop. After all, we all had lives before this that we kind of don't want to be super shitty when we finish the fight.This only works when both sides agree though. 
Another thing about chemical weapons is that soldiers can prepare and defend against them (gas masks, mopp suits) while civilians would be helpless. 
Jesus fuck.The Sundial probably could've burnt and irradiated nearly everywhere on earth regardless of detonation area.Holy shit. The dude who designed didn't stop to think at all if he should do it.Why would anyone ever need a weapon that absurdly destructive, to the point you could irreperablly damage the earth and kill literally billions of people? That's just... Wrong.
It's endurance is described in *weeks*. That's serious shit.
The Ministry of Defence tends toward random names that don't hint at what the project actually is while the Department of Defense likes to give the game away on the front page, a bit like the Germans during the war.
Also neutron flux/gamma radiation being radiated from it. It was a 600MW reactor, basically 1/3 nuclear plant, unshielded. Really not something I would want to stand close to
A lot of them didn't do it willingly. There were guards forcing them to with guns.
Once everyone who was involved is dead, the docs will be released.
I think he's saying it won't be creepy because it'll be mostly images or files stating mild stuff like that. 
Imagine screwing up the autopsy of the President of the United States.
Optimists believe we live in the best of all possible worlds.Pessimists fear this to be true.
I've always loved military understatement.
Yeah, no core in it, though.I lived in Florence for a few years, found out about that then...creepy to think about how irresponsible we are with our nukes, then realize Russia has them too, then watch a dashcam video from Russia and think...how are we all possibly still here...
Only seems fair really. 
That's why they invented ICBMs. We no longer have nuclear armed bombers on permanent patrol.
Cant help but think people would point fingers at the soviets too. Nuclear war avoided.
From what I've read and found,  most nuclear explosions are in air,  meaning timed or altitude triggered. Don't quote me on it though. 
Isn't there any ethics approval for experiments in US? WTActualF 
And Beeblebrox was perfect because he didn't care for governing. He made the people happy. That is until he stole The Heart of Gold. 
Or to quote Frank Herbert, author of Dune:    > All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptable.
Another lol:> In the hands of an expert, a powerful pistol is quite deadly, but such experts are rare and not usually available for assassination missions."oh btw Steve on your way home could you assassinate someone for me?""Sorry Mike I don't have any time on my schedule."
They may have planned ahead. The article mentions how at least one woman was told to fake a pregnancy by wearing padding and such so she would appear to be pregnant
Yup, the Soviets. It was a serious consideration at the time.If you fancy having the shit scared out of you, go and have a watch of the BBC drama Threads (readily available online) which dates from that period and depicts exactly what would happen to one of England's biggest cities in the event of a war. I was born well after it was produced and well after nuclear war was even a possibility but it still scares the fuck out of me.
but doesnt acid lose half the power of its dose if you use it the next day, for example if you do 100ug one day, and do the same amount the next day it would only feel like taking 50ug?
Hah, that's one helluva occupational hazard. "Spontaneous psychedelic experiences may occur." 
I've heard 4 life sentences, but yeah, this is what Wikipedia has to say; >As a Harvard undergraduate, Kaczynski was among twenty-two students who were research subjects in ethically questionable experiments conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray from late 1959 to early 1962.
The flashbacks of being terrified by this movie are coming back. 
Who says it can't be both?
Worst case? An enemy spends the money and you don't, then turns out it *works.*
Until some Jupiterian Overlord orders the Europan Army to finally advance on Saturn and it's moons, hoping to conquer and defeat The Saturnistic ideology because they are a bunch of dirty space cucumbers who keep picking fights for no reason and are slowly spreading throughout the solar system.
> Then the moment they heard the audio from the tape the memories came flooding back and they remembered everything.This is fucking horrifying, I imagine that flood of information could near destroy your mind.
It's the taped intro for his victims. He basically explains the victim will become a sex slave in horrific detail.
Exactly.  It really bit them in the ass when they lost the war.The allies knew exactly who did what.
If it were any other country, yeah, but even that wouldn't be able to take out Russia. Just too much space.
You also need to already have clouds, it doesn't just make water from nothing.
the higher the stakes, the more chance these gentlemanly rules get subverted
The Sundial blast would've been the size of Texas. The fallout and subsequent nuclear winter would have probably killed almost everyone on the planet.
There was a guy on NPR talking about Jones town. He said over half the people were either kids or elderly who would have had no way surviving in the jungle and would die either way. Basically the mos of the people had no real choice in the matter
And you can imagine people being a little hesitant to raise their hands and admitting to accidentally nuking North Carolina. That delay could be absolutely fatal: someone's nuked NC and the military aren't saying anything.
Damn, I'd go just to look at the sign. I mean, look how impressive it is. Really carries the weight of what nearly happened there. 
This and nazi experiments are why there is ethical approval now, before that there was nothing
Even then, his job wasn't to govern, it was to distract the people from who was *really* in charge.
Or Terry Pratchett> Some chief went to prison to see the prime minister and said, 'Mate, your mob can dig it all up and drop it over the edge of the world, no worries.'> > 'Why did he have to go to prison?'> > 'We put all our politicians in prison as soon as they're elected. Don't you?'> > 'Why?' >>'It saves time.' 
What level is tom cruise & john travolta?Ooh. And will smith.
My God, they've created a pay to win game!!!
Smart of your grandma. I would assume they'd just give the kid a different name though (once they took her). 
>after nuclear war was even a possibilitySo we're in the clear now? Phew!
Yes, it makes me wonder how space travel would be different if those men hadn't come back. 
Well it's not exactly 50% but yes, LSD tolerance builds very quickly. However with government approval and a lab large amounts of pure LSD can be easily synthesised. So whose to say they weren't giving these people MASSIVE doses of lsd toward the end of the experiment to keep consistent results?
Makes me wonder how the other 21 are doing...
Yeah, that was quite the exaggeration.  These aren't even close to Google Maps quality.
That Owl still freaks out my sister.
It's like the scene in Finding Dory when Dory suddenly remembers her parents. Except, it's not that wholesome.    
To further elaborate on the above. We aren't talking like a paragraph of extreme detail here.We are talking like a full on page or two about him and his buddies getting off on watching his dog rape the victim in more detail than you can be prepared for. I think the beastiality portion is what fucked me up and stuck with me all this time more than anything. But there isn't a "that's not so bad" part to any of the transcript  
Sounds silly but this would be the perfect defensive weapon. Don't attack us or we will detonate it and everyone loses. This was part of the plot of Dr. Strangelove. The Russians couldn't keep up with the us economic system so they built a weapon that would wipe out all life if a nuclear explosion went off in their territory. The problem is that once this weapon was built and the design known all it would take is some rogue state to say we all lose and boom. Game over planet earth. 
"I think the moon would look better if we added another crater riiiiight here."
I had no idea this was in Guyana until you said jungle. I honestly thought this happened in the U.S. 
You should read up on Jim Jones, he was nuts near the end. Apparently he would give people Kool-Aid tell them it was poisoned as a test on a regular basis to see if they would drink it before he actually did this.
Well, that's the most depressing sentence I've read in a while. 
Machi and her mom both fled to the US (they had enough money to get out luckily), so now her name is more of a reminder  of how close she was to losing her freedom and family. Her mom was also a badass sweetheart who swore like a sailor until she passed away in her late 90's. I should mention that Machi is my Tia in the sense that I have known her from birth - I actually don't have any aunts on my mom's side, so my mom's lifelong friends have become 'Tia' very quickly. 
I feel you. It's because it is so utterly blunt about what it's displaying that it's so effective. The special effects are ramshackle and low budget and they simply didn't have the money to make it flashy, so what you get is just an hour and a half of normal people suffering presented as casually as a kitchen sink drama.I know someone who remembers being shown it in school, which is practically child abuse.
I read somewhere that procedure was that NASA would cut communications. Imagine that, being stranded on the moon, just you and one other person until you suffocated to death. Scary stuff.
There are very few things I know about on the Internet that I steer clear of because I just don't want to deal with them:- this one- and the video/audio of the guy driving along when a brick comes through the windshield and obliterates his wife's head.I know there's a ton more along those lines but I don't go looking for that sort of stuff, these two both come up on Reddit occasionally and are staying blue.
That was the philosophy of most of the arms race at a point. Dr. Strangelove wasn't just some goofy movie, but it was an analysis and criticism of the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction. 
They also assassinated a member of Congress who came down to investigate
He was nuts from the start. I was there. I saw him on stage in SF around 1975. 
The idea was to let them die in peace and with privacy, not broadcasting their every panicked word to everyone on Earth.
That's exactly the line that got me thinking. 
if you think there's not at least one division working on that tech, you're out of your mind
Real life wallhacks
There is Mutually Assured Destruction and then there is Mutually Assured Destruction via SUICIDE BOMBING.
I think North Korea uses these sorts of bluffs. 
Yup. Exactly
As someone who works in a control environment I'd imagine it's also taking into account that listening in to them as they died would just break the comms guy and ruin his life...
I assume their families would be allowed to say farewells.
Yeah, I don't see any reason not to maintain communication in this situation if the technology allows it.
With all the free information we are divulging on social medias, they would know us better than we know ourselves by know most likely
Taliban must have felt laggy as fuck.
Sundial - when MAD is not both hardcore AND fucked up enough.
Eventually NK is going to say:"You know what? Fuck trying to launch a missile at them, build a giant underground fallout shelter and a **giant** bomb."
The thing is, they were actually drinking Flavor Aid. It wasn't even Kool-Aid. So it's probably doubly annoying for Kool-aid execs.
That's what I was thinking. I'd hate to cut them off, but if I was responsible for the people listening, I'd have to do it. Mostly because I would be afraid they'd be like me and feel an obligation to keep communication open and it would fuck them up. It's better for the person in charge to feel like shit for the rest of their lives than expect their subordinates to. 
What is it with cults cutting corners and getting off brand crap? Kool Aid isn't even that expensive. 
That could also apply to muggers.

For a comedian to be so clean and yet make me laugh is genius work. I'm a fan of Doug Stanhope if that puts things into perspective.I went to a Regan show a few years back and he was transitioning over to Godspeed which I hadn't heard at the time. Loved it. He did requests at the end which I've never seen a comedian do. People yelling "the big yellow one is the sun" at him from the audience, still makes me chuckle.

How long did it take you to find your job? What degree do you have currently and how long did it take you to get there? Have you always worked for the elementary school or were you also in research?

Not all jobs need college.  Nobody can answer that question until you know what you're gonna do.College is expensive, but very rewarding and can lead you to a great career that pays well.  You have to decide for yourself -- is it worth it?
Find local youth leagues in your area, they are frequently in need of a lot of help due to lack of volunteers. They are normally more then willing to train people who want to referee or umpire.

Not OP, but pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Someone that welds while diving. It requires licenses that take time and money to earn, but can prove to be profitable if you are willing to put in the time. It is still a manual labor job, so you will need to consider how long you can do it for. Finding the right contracts can be very lucrative with people allegedly earning a six figure salary in USD.
Yep, I have a degree in computer science from one of the top colleges in the United States, and I worked as a software engineer for Microsoft before doing youtube full time.
Nope, everyone is very supportive. They mostly just think it's really cool that I'm able to make a living this way.
I'd say I work roughly 40 hours a week, though it varies. I'm working a bit more now that I'm live streaming several times per week. I work a lot on the weekends.My friends generally are very interested in my job, its much easier to relate to the minutiae of my job than a normal desk job. I also get a fair number of video ideas from my friends, and they like that sort of limited involvement.
Varies widely, but activities include playing around with random ideas in minecraft (sometimes as a vague as "what are some cool things I can do with x block"), livestreaming for 3 hours, browsing reddit a lot, checking comments on my videos, writing some experimental code, and, of course, building things in minecraft and recording videos.For various reasons I can't/won't say how much I make, but it's enough that I don't worry about paying the bills.
Really more of a marsh, honestly.  
In terms of interesting?  Getting to work with friends who had birds of prey.  They're just fascinating animals!

A couple geology/geography classes, too!  
There are three* general fields: prep, production, and post-production. *maybe also marketing and distribution...    I work in production, where the actual shooting gets done.

I work as a grip in the United States (whose job duties differ from UK and Euro grips). Short description is non-electrical lighting (with mirrors, white foam boards, large rags often made of cloth to diffuse light), or rigging lights or cameras to places they don't normally belong. If a camera isn't on a tripod or a light isn't on a stand, a grip or rigger will make it so! Example: wheeling the camera on a dolly on tracks, booming the camera on the end of a long jib, rigging lights to ceilings or onto cars, etc.

I get to learn something new, and I love learning new things. It keeps life interesting. Too bad, now a days you kind of have to have a degree for almost everything.

The "reddit all day" sounds bad but its really not. His job is to fix things when they break, but a good system admin will manage to engineer a network that never breaks. If your sysadmin seems to be doing nothing all day that just means he's great at his job. If they're constantly running around putting out fires then they suck at it. It's counter-intuitive.
You have to actively participate in the film community. You meet other filmmakers, talk about your passion for editing, see what they're working on, let them know you're interested and see where it goes.    Generally you build connections over the years after learning who you trust and like to work with. It's a process for most of us, unless you were born into the trade.

Jimmies or sprinkles? Coming from a professional doughnut maker, you should know best of all. 
this. firstly, i LOVE watching behind the scenes stuff. why wouldn't i? it's like being a fly on the wall of the big budget movies i havent worked my way up to yet! secondly, i'm not very critical of movies, i'm a pretty easy-going viewer. i like all the big blockbusters, i don't get too caught up in Awards; i just want to see some spectacle, and a good story or some fun characters. :)i actually kind of enjoy explaining to my SO or my friends and family "how they shot this thing" or if they're nodding to something else behind the 4th wall. 
You should be a mechanic, I am and I have a hard time pronouncing my name some mornings. I ruined a "defective" fuel pump because I wanted to see how much distance and pressure I could shoot water across the shop.

He doesn't mess with my toolbox and I feel bad because the porter got involved and she's such a sweet girl. She hasn't talked to me in 2 days now and throws my tickets at me
The boxes say "sprinkles" but my family is from New England, where they're called jimmies. I'm so conflicted!
I don't know why you'd get that much grief. I've been wrenching for 15 years and one of the big rules is to not go into someone else'sBox unless they told you it was cool.Hell, I've worked in the same place 9 years now and I won't go into another mechanics box without talking to him, even if he has told me mi Casa es su casa. 
My dad says jimmies. The way I see it, if they're just chocolate, they're jimmies. If it's rainbow or any other kind, they're sprinkles. 
True, Rainbow Jimmies sounds more like a gay bar.

You used to be able to get into directory levels and download mp3's like this. Haven't tried in a while. 
You can tell how much internet experience someone has by the way they phrase their searches. 
Google advanced search works if you're trying to sift through a tonne of things that are close to your search but not exactly. My problem is that my searches turn up nothing anyway so advanced search narrows 10 useless responses to 0 responses
True, but this can also bring up biased information. Check the inverse search too, if possible
That's how I found Reddit in the first place. After multiple google searches to my questions I would keep ending up here. So then I started always added Reddit to the end. Couple years later made an account.  Now I'm on here every day.

Or use proper questions. Google can interpret natural language.
So what you're saying is that OP should have googled for this instead of asking us?
This might be too specific of a question but I was trying to figure out something similar to this a few days ago.  Would that work for a website that has overlays to blur things out? For example, if you wanted to see the answer to a question on Chegg thats partially blurred out?

Thanks, this had bugged me lately, but not enough to Google the solution. Which is totally embarrassing in retrospect. 
I would put just that word in quotes. 
Years ago you used to be able to use this syntax to search for valid credit card numbers (e.g. 4000000000000000..4999999999999999), of which there were a jaw dropping number posted online, not even by scammers or whatever, more like small businesses not knowing the difference between intranet and internet site... I think Google censors those results now.
This is the only good way to search redditNow if only it didn't link to shitty fucking mobile versions
-site:... is more reliable 
Sometimes the whole process is figuring out the right terms to use. But that's usually where the less adept fail.But fancy features become more useful when you are dealing with names/terms that have multiple meanings. Products named with common words, or just trying to find the thing that shares a name with a much more famous thing.
I trust Reddit more than many other sites. I can read a bunch of different opinions and be sure that I'm not being misinformed by a biased source.
Seriously, pinterest in image results is fucking cancer.

If there are few results it tries to guess what you meant. Tools-All Results>Verbatim makes it behave.
I always look for reddit threads
Google treats the slash (and lots of other punctuation) as basically any word delimiter, so `John/Smith` becomes `John[non-word character]Smith`. Since it has no spaces, then Google will not separate the terms and search them as a unit. The difference between that and `"John Smith"` is that `John/Smith` should return any of:* John-Smith* John/Smith* John.Smith* John Smith* etc.

Dear Google, what's that thing where the guy does the stuff with his hand, and then the girl gets that thing that smells bad? Thank you, from Doris.
Be succinct.
Oh, you need a pressurized cement consistometer
The more words you use, the more of those words need to be in your ideal search result. Similarly, Google has an easier time mapping synonyms and similar words to those chosen if the string is shorter.*That said*, if your query is very close to what you're actually looking for, this isn't a bad way to go.
Yeah. A couple of days back I was looking for one specific Back to the Future quote that I only half-remembered. So I searched "back to the future enough future boy" and good ol' Google found it, enabling me to make a low-effort shitpost without even having to remember the quote. Thanks Google engineers.
And then you use quotation marks 
If youjust searched "satellite with gold disk" you get similair results. Depending on what youre looking for too much filler words can make it harder to find things.

My Google search life in a nutshell
Absolutely. For instance, searching "vaccines cause autism"... 
Sadly after years of watching people use search engines I would say minimum 75%+ of people ask questions. 
Honestly just 'dog cherries' would be fine
Returned results for:Jeeves disappointed we've fallen
Actually probably optimized for this behavior 
Probably because all the old people do this
(ananas OR pineapple) AND (sperm OR jizz) AND taste
Same. Finding out about reddit has been both the worst and best decision of my life. 
Use and, or, and not. Boolean operators. 
This do confuse my gentle brain. 
I tried that, well I tried removing the overlays and it appears that they are just images being blurred. It could work, but I don't know. 
Forums that u need a login to read the content.
yeah, i saved the parent post to come back to  today.. something about typing "something:" before a url to get through registering for forums.Anyone know what it was?
/10 is the glistening oasis in a desert of legal research. 
Teaching people about the + made me feel like a genius when I was in high school sad it's gone
Thanks! I get so pissed off every time Google searches "verbatim" by finding synonyms, translating, etc...
When they started Google Plus. I think they want(ed) to dedicate the + sign to search for user handles. 
Problem is these days it thinks it's smarter than you and sometimes searches synonyms even then.

No, it's one search with wider additional criteria. The way you use it it's NBD -- what I'm talking about is something like 100000..900000 -- that shit will get you shut down.
-site:i.reddit.com will exclude mobile pages.
Honestly, this site can be a gold mine at times but the search function here is garbage. So half the time I need to google something I add "reddit" at the end lol.
Just when you think you found something cool, you have to make an account 
Maybe you're a robot. 
Yup. This exactly. If I don't add "Reddit" to my search I just get a bunch of clickbait articles.
`"John/Smith" OR "JohnSmith"` would cover all variations, too. `OR` can be used, and it works as you'd expect.
surprisingly, this is the way I google. and there's usually a few typos in there too. and I'm usually able to find an answer faster than anybody else who is looking. lol. well, I don't thank google afterward but I do usually post my query in plain text "the movie where the guy builds that pile of dirt in his kitchen" etc
Same boat. It used to be that this was an ineffective way of searching, but now it works pretty well especially if it's a question that's likely been asked before.

Between one broad search and one specific one I usually find what I'm after.
Your comment is the to Google search result for 3DGlobe.wrf.
Actually, "satellite gold disk" would be enough
The Faculty!
It's a porn search you silly goose.
that illustrates your point well, though I've often found when I google that it's overwhelmingly about how trustworthy vaccines are.
I don't know why you regard that as sad. Depending on what you're looking for, typing a question is frequently a good way to turn up a result of someone asking the exact same question in a forum somewhere, followed immediately by the answer. This is particularly true with common software. You being the first person anywhere to have a particular problem with Excel is like winning the lottery - not fuckin likely.
... I don't trust you.
>Returned results for: Jeeves disappointed we've fallenHere's what I got: About 174,000 results (0.78 seconds) Poor Jeeves.
Yep, in a presentation a few months ago from a guy at Google, he told us they are trying to make it answer questions that are in natural language... Which obviously is not helped by people who type only keywords (like me) because they don't trust it lol. He was working in a team that makes some back end stuff about understanding natural language better, which helps with all Google products like search, translate, etc.
Yes I do (49 yo here, still feel 25 damn you all!)
I'm sure they used that example in your understudy.
Yeah I do but those are no replacement.  The "+" operator forced the results to contain a certain term.  For example "+adidas running shoes" would return results that ALWAYS had the term adidas.  It was great.
Not a true modo.  More of a quasimodo. 
Yeah thats what I tried as well, with some extension for google chrome. What he was saying though maybe sounded like you could just access the forum without signing in. Not expecting it to work, but can't hurt to ask
So the gold subreddit 
Yup, may be that's why it is "undocumented"!
I got 2 and 2 respectively. WTF is going on?
No wonder I was having so much trouble last week.  Why the hell did they remove it? 
Triple is 'real verbatim' and single is 'sort of verbatim with other crap google thinks is relevant'.e:although it seems very recently they've even altered that and made it similar to single quotes and I can't even find information on it anywhere anymore
Damn, what will happen when they launch Google Colon in 2018
God damn I hate it when it thinks its smarter than me. The other thing is when it takes the one key term *out* because it found way more results with that term missing... except I was *trying* to narrow down the search to the small subset of manageable results, not wade through 100,000 unhelpfully broad ones!
What does the cap say?
Ah makes sense, thank
-site:pinterest.com will exclude useless image results.
Fucking Google amp needs to die in boiling acid. 
Reddit is valued at at least $240 million dollars, and they can't make a half decent search function.
The trick is to read the most upvoted post that confirms your opinion. This way you won't see any bias at all. 
If only someone made a Reddit thread about tips for using Google and the first answer was how to view sites without creating an account
On google, If you click on the "complaint" links on those DMCA notices it brings you to an organized list of each URL that was subject to complaint. This is a good way to find the mp3 or other file you're looking for, ironically.
Is that real? They seem hesitant to even tell what vx means
"I'm the guy who wipes down the loads."
Probably mostly weed lol
Actually it was Charlie Bartlett but The Faculty was awesome too! 
Google scholar puts this argument to rest. You can literally search "thimerosal" and read the abstracts of the top cited papers.You don't even have to understand the study, abstracts are often written in plain English and are easy to digest.
Wait is trump an antivaxxer?
Some of the greatest scientific minds are on the spectrum.
I have had decent google fu for years now, and once in a while the old way gets me nowhere and I'll end up just typing a question like google is god. It actually works.
Google's put in a lot of effort to try and give good results to the less-skilled searchers that only search using questions. I've noticed that questions work really well if they're "when...?" sort of questions. I've had less impressive results with other question-words, but still use them from time to time.
My wife Googles literal questions.I use keywords.She sucks at Google.
"Do pineapples, also known as ananas, have an effect on the taste of your sperm, also known as jizz?"Or, find a result that includes:Either "pineapple" or "anana", Also either "sperm" or "jizz", Also "taste"
Just use quotation marks.. "adidas" "running shoes"
lol that place is boring trust me you don't wanna go there 
Yeah she would. She likes the front door and the back door.
Makes sense, my mind didn't see that information
Not hard to see what's happening here, just put two and two together.
I got 70,700,000 results...Not sure what to think. 
Happened back when they released Google+, so probably because it interfered with that.
The 500 early adopters will insist that the quality of shits taken with a Google colon is vastly superior, but no other shits will be given
Results for "how to fix car in GTA":* How to fix cars! * ^^^missing: ^^^~~GTA~~
Doesnt always work. Cant come up with an example right now, but sometimes even with verbatim, google still occasionally thinks it knows better than you.
I'm not sure what a straight up ban says, but before that point is reached google will start serving you captchas with the stated reason being "recent unusual activity" and if my memory serves me correctly they will also sometimes just not give you the results page on the first try and you need to do it again. I'm assuming that's just another variety of captcha in the sense that it might trip up some bots that don't get the expected results or they might parse that page in a way that normal browser users won't and google will detect.
mr skeltal
Fuckin pinterest with their domination of the Google image results.
What even is Google amp?  I use like every single Google product daily and still I have never heard of that.
People give posts ambiguous titles and wouldn't bother tagging them"I just found this weird tip today to help with my craft" is probably the title of that post you're looking for, and you'll never find it because of the stupid title
also 'site:reddit.com\/r/subredditname' to limit the results to one subreddit.
I feel like this is what the internet is supposed to be and you have to enter the info in like a programmer. Not quite but most people won't put in that extra step all the time. 
Of course you have to do some thinking in the process to decipher what is bs and what is not. I feel like that thinking shouldn't stop at the internet but also in books especially history books.
That's the correct way to do it on google; the parentheses are for ebay only (per OP's edit).
Might aswell use the robot that was posted everywhere a few weeks ago then.
Someone in the future loves you.
I love and hate when the top search result links to a forum where the first / only respond is "How difficult is it to do a quick google search?" Well it was a lot easier if YOU didn't messed up the google results you asshole
The other day I typed in "The other pig movie" Gordy was the first result. I was amazed. 
Its django unchained. Great movie.
Fellow junkie here. Do not be led astray by people who are anti-science or anti-intellectual. This is real research.

Well, he said they are trying :P He even admitted that Allo's assistant thing doesn't work very well which was surprising because it was fairly new at the time
"ananas" is the word for pineapple in a few languages, it's not a plural of "anana".
"Up a row or two"WHICH IS ITI need specific instructions :(
Right there's definitely no discussions between the masterminds of Reddit who are secretly controlling the masses there. Seriously, don't bother! 
"Desks of cheez its"
I've been in that situation before. Try saying aloud "siri, what to think". If that doesn't help you should try "alexa, what to think". If problem still persists just keep screaming until someone comes to help.
And they didn't think of renaming their useless unused service rather than messing with an age old convention. Urgh, Google. 
If no other shits can be given, maybe Google is the superior colon.
man if this was 2009 i would use some rage memes, welp.

True story. Made a thread about an obscure Chinese electronic component. Found my own solution and posted it later on. Months later another user thanked me for it with that xkcd comic attached. 
Lol it totally works, I'm very impressed. "The pig movie" turns up Babe, "The other pig movie" turns up Gordy.
It isn't a joke, there are posts in that subreddit that clearly explain exactly what "VX" is...
"0 results"
Was much funner a minute ago when OP couldn't spell Banana. Now instead of comedy it's tragedy (comedy where I'm the victim)
Yes, exactly, but by using a regular "or" you're kind of implying that it doesn't matter, as long as it's at least one. But grammatically, what you said is certainly more correct. 
but does it have sharks with freaking lazer beams on their forheads

Google engineers must be scratching their heads over this sudden surge in 'Brittney Spear' search - while looking for a way to profit from it
I don't think that - works any more. It's a trick I used to use lots, but haven't been able to get working recently. 
Interesting... I use chrome, signed in to google on an android phone and somehow that's just never come up.  Sounds annoying unless you have absolutely tragic internet speeds.

When discussing something on a reddit thread I often open a new tab to Google the topic being discussed. More often than not my top search results will be a reddit link. I wouldn't have to use Google for that if reddit had a decent search engine at least for its own content.   
It's no joke! There's a lot of active research into sub-Coulombic inductance coils. Apparently they could have applications in electric cars, Hyperloop projects, and Cranford C-beams. 
Did you mean: "Dank Memes"?
I too thought that OP misspelled bananas 
Just standard lazer beams I'm afraid.

Ask all of them and get them to discuss it amongst themselves
Or most things they do. Here's a laptop! But you can't take it out of the house as it needs data to work. No it doesn't have data capability haha
Yeah, as others said Google just decides it's smarter than you and thinks "No, spear is obviously wrong because it doesn't generate nearly as many search results!"
that's too gay dude
Your name is not as unique as you think it is ;)
My buddy did his PhD on Cranford C-beams. Their paradoxical change in structural strength compares to withstanding deep oceanic pressures when the forces are applied perpendicularly, where only the hypercrust plating was applicable in the tangent corners. The sub-Coulombic inductance coils could funnel out the weak energy so only the forces necessary to maintaining integrity of the C-beam and increasing its resistance/kg property remain within the structure.

It's military v. Military v. Police v. Public support for coup v. Public support for erdogan. Then you've also got the Kurds...many against the coup, some I presume will see this an opportunity for advancing their own political aims, etc etc. What a complete mess.
As is tradition
Yeah the live thread is very confusing"Coup has failed""Military in control""Erdogan in Istanbul with thousands of supporters ""That is old shit he are streaming"My head hurts.
I feel like this summarizes 2016 so far.
Both the AP and CNN idiotically claimed what was propaganda without verification
What a slimy, spineless little shit. 
Yeah, it didn't really last long and now he can put forward more extreme laws and reduce the power of the military who's only job since the foundation of the country was to make sure it stayed secular
Request for asylum was denied by Germany, haha. 
"We are hearing that a coup is occurring in the democratically elected Turkey, the military wants to out democratically elected leader Erdogan, who was democratically elected" -CNN  
Calls people to the streets, flees instead of helping. Lmfao
Yup. A failed coup is a hundred times worse than no coup at all. Erdogan will now have reason for vengeance, and some very twisted legitimacy for further action. 
no one knows. the only "repelled" reports are coming from Turkish state and government agencies.the ones whom would benefit from actually repelling it.
I'm very afraid of that happening. 
Does it make you feel comfortable that he is talking about Pennsylvania and implying CIA involvement while we have nukes in his country? 
Propaganda?
Yeah... Very strange! It's all just so confusing! I hope some light is shed on this situation very soon! 
Scarily, it is EXACTLY like that. 
Good thinking! Those fighter jets would have made light work of him. 
Yeah, Ankara is pretty much locked down by the Pro-Coup forces.Still haven't seen anything other than Police vs. Military either - I think the lack of Military vs. Military might show that a far larger group might support the coup than originally broadcasted.
CNN aired footage of some sort of confrontation on the bridge. There were tanks on the bridge, and civilians crowding under an overpass with flags and the likes, chanting something. You could hear gunfire, but nobody knew if it was being fired at the state police, or if it was riot control weapons being used to disperse the crowds.
I am and I'm terrified for Turkey. Erdogan would be unstoppable if the coup fails. 
Can't help but be thankful. But I feel sad for the innocent people that are caught in the crossfire.
Not everyone lost, there was one winner and his name was Sultan Erdogan
exactly,now erdocunt is asking to snitch on internet coup supporters so he can hang them all as traitors.yeah thats democracy bitchez.
The censorship over there makes it difficult to hold a discussion.
Turkey already had a couple of millitary coups before while part of NATO. America likes the Turkish military a lot more than edrogen and wont stop this 
If they attached a generator to attaturk they could generate enough power for half of turkey just from him spinning in his grave.
Why are the Kurds against the coup, I thought they didn't like Erdogan?
Relevant username
Correct, Turkey is one of the few nations where the military is a separate entity. They were built and designed by Ataturk to make sure Turkey never turns to Islam.I don't think this is the first time they've done this, too.
That's pretty bizarre, but hey if it's stupid but it works it's not stupid. 
Ferdinand Marcos did this shit in the Philippines too.  Suspicious attack/coup and then martial law for a decade.  He syphoned the Filipino reserves and got rid of anyone in his way.  He only lifted martial law because the Pope refused to visit if he didn't.  I hope this doesn't happen with Erdogan, but it's not looking good.  Be safe.
That is my interpretation as of now. New developments may change my opinion but it just seems too staged to me. 
Or some more eager faction of the military got swindled they had more support and to go for it and are now used as scapegoats. 
Well, tyranny lasts for as long as people refuse to stand up to it. Every nation so far has shockingly, subtlety backed ergodan tonight...
There was no coup
As an American who knew nothing about him until an hour ago he sounds like a total douche. 
This is the military's 5th or 6th coup in a hundred years.  They have had some practice.
It's a snapchat of a TV of a facetime.
That's the second most important thing a military should be doing. All enemy's both foreign and domestic. 
What I've read is that people really like the military and support them when they overthrow.You would then think that the people would then elect people who would please the military.Yet, obviously not. Why?
I want to get off 2016's wild ride
2016's Franz Ferdinand.
what times are not interesting? Remember there was world war one and world war two times. Cold war times. There is always something going on but of course since we are alive now it seems worse.
Shut the fuck up, Donnie
The winners write the memes
Don't worry, Germany told him to fuck off I think.
he is still in the country, though.
Exactly.  It's a sad fucking day.
See, Germany really does screen its incoming refugees for potential terrorists...
Believe it or not that's a strong argument here. And considering Erdogan's supporters don't even hesitate to call for our death(infidels) even in peace, the guy is seen as the evil-found-body by the more educated population.Don't mistake, Erdogan's voterbase is unarmed ISIS. 
CNN is disgusting. They are nothing but a State Department mouthpiece. Of course CNN didn't use that type of rhetoric for the coup in Ukraine because it was supported by the US. But Erdogan is a strategic asset to the US because he helps the US arm the radical Islamists in Syria and is hostile to Russia.There is nothing moral or ethical about modern US foreign policy and there is no real journalism at CNN. Disgusting shills is all that they are.
Sounds suspiciously like an attempt to raise a shield using the turkish people as bait to force the army to retaliate against the population.
Germany rejected him, now's he's looking to the UK
Inside job by Erdogan to go "SEE, told you the military would coup" and using the fervor of his supporters, he'll sign in a new constitution that effectively neuters the power of the military and makes them a puppet for his Neo-Ottoman ideas to be used to put them into action? Also for a power grab and become like a dictator? 
If you're on holiday in the country, I suggest you contact your embassy in the country (if you have one) and ask what they advise you to do.
Germany should've accepted and then put him under house arrest so he can't stir up more shit.
Following the playbook. Night of Long Knives will follow, then Kristallnacht.
Exactly. If an outside power (say Iran ) were to attack Turkey, then the US and the rest of the NATO members would be required to respond.This is a internal matter and no response is required. Plus, I think most (if not all) NATO members will consider this a positive tthing.
They hate both. Secular military dictatorships in Turkey have historically been no kinder to the Kurds than Erdogan has. The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend. Besides the Kurdish parties themselves, no political force in Turkey is friendly to the cause of Kurdish independence or even Kurdish autonomy. 
Actually, he's just a coffee table. 
Despite how serious this is, this single post made me lol very hard. 
Well not necessarily stopping turning back to Islam but more to stop any straying from secularity.
That's usually how it goes. 
This seems more plausible than a completely faked one. Erdogan hears of a plot and allows it to go forward in a controlled manner, and reaps the benefits. 
It's wrong,  but not shocking. For example,  Turkey is a major NATO ally,  and they have a very strategic position to influence the Middle East,  so obviously western leaders don't want to speak out against the Turkish government. 
I had a Simpsons level flip-flop.  "Oh a coup, that's bad." "Oh the people leading the Coup aren't doing too good, that's good." "Oh, the leader of Turkey is an Islamist with an agenda, that's bad." "Oh, the people leading the coup support democracy, that's good!". "President Obama just backed the government instead of the military, that's..."  "It's bad."
I don't think it's really realistic to expect a state, esp a state like Turkey, to be overthrown without any casualties. 
Really depends who you talk to in Turkey. The military was at the head of some very unsavoury Turkish governments in modern Turkish history.Don't blindly believe one side is better than the other just yet as many on Reddit already seem to have made up their minds on who are the good guys.
German government was even more vague: "The democratic order in Turkey must be respected."
What a time to be alive.
It is, but the dangerous bit comes in deciding who is the enemy and who is not.
Secularists in major cities like the millitary more than edrogen and his Islamist party. In the 1980 coup the millitary ruled for 3 years before democracy was resorted same.will.happen now prob if they succeed. The goal if this coup is to remove edrogen who is trying to seize more and more power 
Take me out

This country, man...
I feel like an idiot when I fantasize about being around some drama like this or a tragedy. I want to feel like I've seen REAL shit and have crazy stories. But I always remind myself that peoples lives are obviously more important.
Yes. I'm presently at a Hotel in Side quite far away from Ankara and Istanbul. Everybody, that is Turkish, here pretends like nothing happened. It's odd.
Tell him to fuck off, we dont want himBring him to Glasgow if you must, then we can deal with him efficently
The turks everywhere would lynch him tbh
The U.S. embassy in Turkey has said try not to go to the embassy.
Armies tend to do that when there's little to no oversight.I was gonna mention 16th-17th century armies in the Wars of Religion in Europe, or the American Civil War, but those guys were pretty much fully sanctioned to fuck shit up.
Correct, but considering their position geographically it's unlikely that they'll lean to anything except Islam.
More or less, yeah. It's really confusing compared to Western powers, but it's a very interesting setup the more you read about it.
Someone like him was in power. Until certain countries didn't like him refusing them access to his country's oil. Some shit happened, and boom, modern Iran.
I don't think he's really backing Erdogan it's just that if the coup fails we still have to work with him so best not to say we support the people trying to kill him. It would make meetings awkward 
The message from the followers of Khorne were slightly less so: "Blood for the blood god! Skulls for the skull throne!"
It's a reddit post of a screenshot of a snapchat of a TV of a facetime
The very same.
There are a lot of shitkickers in rural Turkey. & rigged ballots, maybe.But it must be said; lot of shitkickers. Huuuge crowds of shitkickers.In this, Turkey is a lot like everywhere else.
Yea, just look at Egypt for the opposite situation.
problem is, turkey is huge, and apart from the big secular cities there's a lot of not-so secular countryside
Considering the military is (mostly, supposed to be) secular, while Erdogan is an Islamist, I would think so.
Take me out inside
What's a pederast, Dude? 
>Greece?Yeah, historically speaking Greece and Russia both hate Turkey more than anyone else.
A land of strong values and resilient people. The Turks can build empires as easily as they can destroy them.
The moment you do, you'll wish you didn't.
They should, better to stay calm and not 'pour out' onto the streets like erdogan says. Maybe they're used to it or expected this stuff anyway.
Even more disgusting is the call to prayer. If I was a practicing religious muslim I'd be offended my beliefs were used towards political gain WHILE RISKING MY LIFE.
I'll mention it next time we have tea together
What is the reasoning behind that? Is the embassy in Turkey and too dangerous to go there?
Political religion (islamism) is not the only 'un-turkish' or 'un-Kemalist' thing that the military has fought. Socialism and regional or ethnic (Kurdish) separatism comes to mind. 
Based ataturk. I will read some books about him. Sounds like a great man. Real shame they seek to destroy his legacy. 
>You at the barricade, listen to this:  The people of Paris sleep in their beds.  You have no chance,  No chance at all!  Why throw your lives away?
The government will say Erdogan has won until a helicopter is flying his hanged body through the streets.
Like when the US voiced tacit support for the 2002 coup in Venezuela, during the brief period when it looked like it would stick.
Personally, I think if you're in a region that has a risk of Islam coming to town and taking over, it's probably a good thing to say, "hey, FYI...military can come in and protect the people's democratic rights."
Say what you will about khorne, but we always know where he stands. A real straight shooter.
Under most circumstances, I'm decidedly against a military coup of a democratically elected leader. For this one, I think my feelings are pretty mixed.
Can't take out
Greece is like "Fuck yeah, time to take back Constantinople! Let's go boys!"
This is so true. I was in the Yugoslavian wars, and while everyone loves to hear the story I really wish I was unable to tell it.
Erdogan is a fucking moron. He's going to get his own people killed.
A call to prayer like this and the prayers for when a person dies has taken place all over turkey in about 90000+ mosques. A call to prayer like this is a Call to jihad. u can see why we're worried over here in turkey. Secular turkey is gone after this day u can be sure. I will be weeping.
They probably say this because it would mean leaving shelter to go there, and if the embassy is attacked, there is a higher chance of civilian casualties.
He also banned burquas in Turkey.
Well the last major rebellion in the U.S. was about a century and a half ago. Looks like we're due over here. 
"It is not over! We are reaching new heights!"
That's because if it's a coup and it's in Latin America the United States is almost always the one throwing it.
Yeah that's assuming the Army never undergoes a religious awakening.  I know it's super unlikely as they think it's their job to be secular, but weirder things have happened.
Its Tzeentch you have to worry about.
The main problem with democracy, and its greatest internal contradiction:What happens when a leader or government is democratically elected, which seeks to undermine or dissolve the very democracy that brought them to power?
TAAAAAAAKE MEEEEEE
Good way to demonize the military, no?
no way would they attack the embassy - isn't that pretty much declaring war on the us?
At this point I would expect fancy invitations to be sent out by the State Department...
I think after this, assuming the army loses, which it appears it will, there will be a massive purge and it will "enjoy" an awakening. 
Then it's fair game to kick them out.
call my name and...TAKE ME OUT!
Knowing how much of a dick he is, he's probably willing to use his own people as pawns.
Attacking an embassy is a very common move for non-state terrorists or guerrillas. US embassies are a relatively common target because the US is disliked by many non-state actors, that's why they're so heavily guarded.
But how do you kick them out when democracy has been subverted?  In other words, is it ideologically consistent to "save" democracy through undemocratic actions?
> probably I guess 100% is still a probability.
But in a way, if they are eliminating democracy, they are also undermining your vote.  They are also removing the very process that brings them to power; meaning they shouldn't have an immediate right to lead a non-democratic state if they were democratically elected.
Ya everyone in school lives on 7 layers of irony and I love it 
I am guilty of secretly enjoying watching parents of students who graduated with my daughter last year having complete melt downs now watching the children they diligently helicoptered become the drunk-party-animal-failing-all their-classes students.Karma may bite me over it, but I hated watching them give their kids *zero* leeway to enjoy any part of their lives.
But how dare your father not give their *little angel* an a+ on everything.What's frustrating is that the same parents that read your post will likely agree with you.  But then a teacher gives *their* kid a bad grade?  Well, now that changes everything.
Once you hit college: you better have brought your calculator mother fucker, no we don't have one for you to borrow.
But I rocked a rad pager during my senior year in 1997!!!
Now it's just "you do that assignment?" "I got it from Johnny you need it?" "Yeah send it" then we just text pictures over
Is this a Daft Punk joke?
> 2007: students came out to me privately in my officethat's interesting to me. What were their motives to explain themselves to a teacher?
Can confirm '17 I work for a cell phone carrier and one of the most highly congested part of our network is surrounding high schools. So not surprised
My little brother just recently graduated high school. During his junior year, another student streaked at a football game.  He was arrested and they tried to get him booked as a sex offender. He ended up killing himself. It was devastating, many many people were horrifie at the school's reaction. I remember my parents specifically saying that streaking at a big game would've been frowned upon but ultimately not a big deal when they were in school.
Nah, TI-84s are far more prevalent in my HS. Especially the new sim ones.
The connection between all generations, Pokemon
>use them as crutcheseven as an adult- I'm guilty of this.  Ten year old me was a much better speller.  
Yes, I've always heard about stereotypes (high school) like jocks not caring about grades and partying all the time. Some of my best friends are sports players and they work incredibly hard.
I was under the impression dabbing died with 2016. Was hoping anyway.
bitch, our fingers are crossed, don't spoil it
You could fuck someone born in 1997
Can I ask if you're in middle/high school or college? When I was in high school, every single person thought they were the exception and that everyone else in their class was a hairless barbarian.
97 - racial slurs07 - you retard17 - ~ironic~racism, homophobia, sexism, etc
Then they go bitch that this generation is too soft
It's even worse when a professor says "Go ahead and cache the entire internet on your laptop and bring it to the exam. It won't help you. Have fun."
Same. And my mom was CONVINCED I was a drug dealer. Mom, I'm on honor roll, student council, I'm a varsity volleyball player, and I just got a full ride to college (state school, but fuck it) ... I'm NOT dealing drugs. I just like my friends to be able to get ahold of me while I'm out driving around aimlessly, possibly mildly intoxicated, so I can stop at the Taco Bell and call them back on a pay phone.DUH. 
I think that's where we're at. The small phones were way thicker.
A Google drive or a network for the students to share everything, making cheating streamlined and efficient.
MBA is a networking degree. You should get it after excelling in the private sector. Kids who get them asap miss out.
God damn if this isn't the truth and most of us are still dealing with the repercussions of not knowing how to handle failure. 
I'm glad somebody else got it
2017 studentCan confirm. Would rather be dead.Not joking.
Yup class of 2018. I was literally crying last week because I realized all I care about right now is my grades and that I'm so caught up in it that I can't even answer the questions "what are your interests?" Or "what do you do for fun?"
Not OP, but I'd guess they likely are students who consider OP a mentor or friend.
Seriously...This whole topic has been an amazing read
The whole idea of a "Sex offender" has become so warped and diluted. It is no longer just for people who pose an actual sexual threat by means of rape or molestation, it is now a catch all for anyone unfortunate enough to have had somebody see them naked. Drunk and peeing in the bushes when a kid sees you? BOOM, Sex Offender. Harmless streaking prank? BOOM, Sex offender... 
TI-84 Plus CE is a work of art
I lived literally through the "hey, look, Internet!" and "hey, look, cell phones!" age. Maybe it's because I was tech inclined, but I learned very quickly to use both really well.There are a lot of people from my generation that don't, though.
And Star Wars.
I remember being made to write fake correspondence emails about random bullshit to my English teacher in high school as part of assignments. Good practice really, it's unbelievable how many people can't string together a coherent email or attempt any semblance of formatting it. 
I laughed when he said she was hot.     (it's probably a plus that she gets along with his daughter)  
That's exactly what I was thinking. I mean I think that movie exaggerated it (the cool kids don't think that "organized sports are so fascist"), but I do think it's true that the nicer, more accepting kids today are the "cool" ones.
Good news everyone, we're going to visit the internet today!
I saw a prequel meme in another teacher's PowerPoint, it was a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. 
'I was born far too late to discover the lands,  And the seas, and the skies, and the shores and the sands.  All the steps have been stepped, and the walks have been walked,  And the sights have been seen, and the talks have been talked.'I was born far too soon to discover the stars,  And I'll never set foot on the red dust of Mars.  I shall only encounter the future in dreams -  But at least I have memes.  But at least I have memes.'    
Referential memory has been a thing for a long time.  That's why you'd see the shelves of books in every engineer's office.  Not just because they'd read them, but because they used them to look up what they didn't need to know off the top of their head.  It's a trade off between how fast you need the info, and how difficult it is to look it up. It's just gotten so easy to look things up that more and more things are easier to remember via where you found them.  
We were 18 at the time and just didn't know better. We do now and that shit wouldn't fly today. We also didn't want to spend our vacation in jail, so we docked in the Florida Keys a few days and went back home instead of the bahamas.
No not the rum ham
I work at Chuck E Cheeses. When I'm in the outfit I dab. Little kids seem to love it still.
Its crystal meth around my area. When I was in school, cocaine was cool, but weed was already on the downward spiral of being typical.Turns out a good bit of my friends were stoners, I was just too oblivious to realize it. Which is probably why everyone looks at me funny when I say I've never smoked weed or did any sort of drugs (with the exception of alcohol, but even then, I didn't drink in high school, only when I turned 21).C/O 2012
The year where Logan just came out.
I was born in 1997 (looks at side camera), ladies
That's fucked up man
To be fair it doesn't matter what decade it is there will always be shockingly stupid people. 
People still say niggerfaggot and call people retarded we've just evolved for more 
Can confirm. I'm in an igneous and metamorphic petrology course right now. All our tests are completely open note, open book, and bringing your laptop is required (both for the internet and Excel being used).Test averages still end up being around ~40-50%. None of the questions are Google-able, we literally just have them because without being able to check various online databases (MinDat, etc) it'd be impossible to get through the test in the 3 hours allotted.
Our school has a Dropbox. The previous class sends pictures of the test questions:answers from last year. Technically not cheating because they released the test last year. 
This is the correct answer. The goons with MBAs have the same answers that goons without MBAs have: more cloud-based data-driven solution engines that free them from doing any real work, and having all sorts of accountability dirt on everyone around them.The difference is the 35 year old that just finished his MBA now knows a shitton of other MBAs that have C-level jobs at other companies, and it's much easier for them to land that sacred C-level on their job title.
The cost of failure has gone up, people can't afford them anymore. 30 years ago, if you dropped out of high school and couldn't even read you could still find a job of menial tasks to make a decent living off. If you pull that today, you will get paid slave money and have to work 3 jobs without even affording a place to live, if anyone would even hire a high school dropout. Multiply by 1000 if you drop out of college and god have mercy on you and your family if you ever get sick and don't die instantly.
Start to? That's already in full swing.
Not just on an academic level. God forbid you make a mistake in front of others then the whole world will know because of social media. 
me too thanks
Look at his username.  Doesn't look like it.
I feel like I'm beyond a nervous breakdown. I've gone past it and now I'm just in this intermediary where no amounts of stress gives me urgency anymore. 
You should care about bats. They are pretty neat!
Yep and also I teach/do research on sex/sexuality topics so a lot of students come out to me.  
My school wifi literally blocks google
I assume the only reason they haven't blocked all those apps is that your IT guys must also use those programs to stream video content all day.
Can you get enough bandwidth through the vpn for Netflix though?
That's awesome. They fucking played you guys.
I got the pleasure of watching a drunk guy outside of a frat house pissing on the side of the house when campus police confronted him. They told him they saw him pissing, and the dude's response was "That's impossible. My dick is so tiny you couldn't have seen it!" Campus police left him alone after making such a watertight argument. 
It's not laws and regulations that are the problem.  (Except for zero tolerance policies). There are certainly cases where you'd want a naked guy hanging around school to be brought up on sex offender charges.The problem is everyone, especially school administrators, being unwilling to use common sense.
No, they should have been burned at the stake for condoning heresy.
And decent! It is a shame that they couldn't do it out of fear. If I was a teacher/admin, this prank would make me smile for two reasons: A) people actually paid attention in history class B) No one got hurt and to be apart of the prank you had to do your thesis!
When I was in seminary I was responsible for decorating the 30ft tall Martin Luther statue in the quad.  I did it seasonally.  I used the school's ladder to do it.  At like 1am.  At seminary.  People these days need to get a bloody grip.
For any who are wondering. No the goat didn't survive. it was a very shallow river and about 20-35 feet above.
If you've ever used a TI-84 Plus C you'll realize how amazing the CE really is
Been in IT for 30 years, beginning on the "big iron". It's the pace of change that is different. Related is, which horse do you want to ride (.net, java, Ruby, etc.)? My kids still roll their eyes at me because, for example, I can't get something to work on it. But when they have computer problem, who do they come to first? Yup, dear old Dad!!
Parents -> kids -> grandkids Original trilogy -> prequels -> new trilogy 
If the student was 18, it's their life. 
this is simple achievement vs mastery. the complex thing is figuring out how to raise children to be motivated by mastery instead.
You are absolutely correct! I do not blame the teachers, I blame the idea that surrounds them. However they say, take AP classes because they prepare you for college. That is not the case at all. I did not find myself more prepared, if anything I had to readjust to how I approached things because college does not hold your hand through a project or paper, you need to guide yourself. Maybe I am in the minority here, but I personally did not benefit from the way AP classes are taught 
That's the stupidest policy I've ever heard. For all what's worth though, back when I was in early primary school (years 1-4, they changed the rules afterwards) you could only give a student a "progresses adequately" (aka pass) or a "needs to improve" (aka fail) grade, in order not to demoralize the kids.Even then it only applied to primary school (up to year 6) not to everything afterwards (so for small kids it kinda sort of makes some sense, but still)
It just all flowed together in a way that suggested he was making a genuine comparison at all levels on his radar with no regard to the perception we might have of him. Just a slice of life.
21 and 22 are two of the best comedies I've seen in years, and the main takeaway is how realistic it is for youth culture (like Mean Girls was when it came out). 
The day my history teacher announced that he doesn't give a shit about dates was the day I was actually excited to go to History class.
The brilliance of this poem is that it is truly depressing. I'm impressed and depressed at the same time. 
Yea but you didn't do anything wrong I don't understand.
I can't afford that crime. :(
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN YOU
That would be my hypothesis as well. Kids in high school now have, in a way, had the veil lifted that was on students 10 years ago. Most of them seem to realize that their future isn't as bright and open as everyone was telling them it would be when they were kids. 
Good for him.
Fuck this guy, pick me! Pick me!
I would guess you do it by being a 13 year old who's never smoked weed or spent time in the woods.
\*raises glass\*
Now if only we had a nationwide transit network like they do...
Social Media has truly shown how narcissism and low self esteem is a pandemic. The only people that get joy out of others misfortune are people that are not happy with themselves and have to get that small feeling of being above someone else. Before social media the trend started with watching reality TV. I can't wait to see what the next 'ego boost' machine will be.
This is very important. People don't realize that we don't post our bad shit on social media, only our best. We shouldn't compare other people's highlight reel with our behind the scenes. 
It would seem from the sentiment in these comments that you've all been thrust into adulthood early. (Correct me if I'm wrong; that's my interpretation.) It's like you have adult rat-race-stress and society hasn't yet let you in the maze.
Haha yeah I hit that point last semester and basically went semi functioning and failed most of my classes. Going better this semester but I genuinely don't care anymore. 
Thank you for being there for those students. I'm sure for some, you were the only accepting person in their lives.
That's messed up.  Google and Wikipedia, etc are literally an extension of our brains these days.  
They most probably know you're using one. They don't care, but they know.
the IT guys can just whitelist whatever sites they want for themselves. Most school IT people have access to anything on the internet... Filters aren't auto-applied to every single account in the district. For example in mine, as a teacher I can access basically anything but porn or graphic shit (liveleak, etc) whereas kids can't use facebook, youtube, anything like that on their accounts. 
My wife's a teacher. Teenagers are soooo bad at keeping shit a secret. Like, teachers have ears, ya know?
Yeah.. I remember when my son was 9, I was checking his computer history, and he had searched for "nekid veginas".  After I excused myself to laugh for 10 minutes, we had another sex talk 
He must have been going for his MS because his BS was already on point
Zero tolerance is the easy way out, they don't actually have to think critically and asses things on a situation by situation basis.Laziness. Also, special snowflake parents.
That's actually hilarious and harmless
It would have been great! If they had used whipped cream, or almost any other type of sticky food item that didn't have a deadly allergy related to it.
Yeah, I remember my days at Catholic school all too well...
I have a soft spot in my heart for goats this is awful
I have the TI-84 Plus CE and it's my favorite calculator. No ragrets on spending $190 on it
My dad learned to program on Fortran. When we looked at my Sophmore year high school schedule and saw the PASCAL course he called it "new fanlged.". This was 1999.
The biggest problem I have with this is that their dependence on their parents is probably what's causing this in the first place.If they're not going to class and lying to their parents about it, they're only there in the first place BECAUSE of their parents. If they'd taken a year abroad or found a reason to actually be there for themselves, they might have succeeded.
Her ass was thick as hell.  My wife and I discussed it more than we talked about my kid's grade.
Why? You got memes, yo!
Not doing anything wrong and not having your day/holiday/life fucked over by over-zealous police are not mutually exclusive, sadly. 
Pirates aren't MY enemies, checkmate international law.
I graduated in 2014 and this was exactly the problem. Our history teacher called us the disillusioned generation. We knew the world sucked and we didn't have time to mess around. We all had jobs and did early college or got certificates if we could. I knew a few kids who wore suits every day for their internships after school. Not even a rich area, but we worried.
Jesus idk why but this got me good. 
> Fuck this guyWhat a great wingman. 
I had an interview for an internship, but they also interviewed 40 people for the position....Apparently they didn't want me. I didn't have enough experience to get the internship to get experience.
Of Mountain Dew?
We westernized long before we got rid of our shogunate so it's unlikely we will get the set of circumstances that will lead to that. We haven't even gotten a first shogun.
I also find social media can really crush one's self esteem because you have all your peers or your old schoolmates or people around the same age as you doing things or collecting all these great achievements, making great connections and seemingly having their life together, while you feel like an utter piece of shit in comparison if you're taking a longer time/less "successful" path to get to the same level. It can get fucking depressing and pressurising.
Exactly. And even when people do realize it, they often don't realize it fully enough to actually compensate for it in their mind and ego. Subconciously even though they know it's just their highlights, they don't feel it to the core enough to counteract the feeling of being lesser.
I didn't mean to imply that I receive no postivitive reinforcment because I do. Most of the time it seems like there is more negative than positive. Or maybe I just see the negative more 
Probably. I'm really not ready to be an adult.At all.
I took me like a month at my job to have my Internet Access unrestricted.My job:Programmer.
The IT guy knows, but he's likely too overworked and underpaid to give a damn. The school administration probably thinks that VPN is some kind of illicit drug.
My school's senior ditch day was ruinedBecause a senior asked her dad if she could participate in itHer dad was the principal 
Jesus. I guarantee there are still teachers there who despise you guys because they're still finding glitter everywhere. That's almost satanic.
When my son was the same age I found "girls who are not wearing underpants" in his browser history.  I actually still can't type that without giggling.
This is why I think it's awesome that pornhub now has a sex education channel to talk about the reality about sex.It's kind of fucked that we now need porn sites to properly educate people on sex, since schools aren't doing it.
After I graduated, the senior prank of the juniors at the time involved bringing the duck owned by one of the students' family members and letting it roam throughout the school. They also followed it in a huge crowd and took pictures with it. They all lost their senior trip to Disney and were threatened with calling the cops and being accused of animal cruelty
Do people have honey allergies?  When you touch that shit, good luck getting it off.
If only that riverbed would have had a soft spot for goats...R.I.P. goat bro
Nah, gotta go nspire CX cas. Not much more expensive and it can do just about everything
The true hipster learns to code exclusively in fractran. 
That sounds like your doctor fucked up
*Insert Arthur Meme here*
It's worse when you live in a small town that collects most of its income from tickets. I drove under two miles to McDonald's yesterday and passed six speed traps. The police have nothing better to do than sit in their dark, unmarked vehicles with the lights off and radar. Well, that and pepper spray teenagers for skating in an empty parking lot. Florida's great.
I'm not sure the pirates would agree.
Also graduated 2014, teachers had to accommodate as so many kids were trying to get into AP classes as AP tests are cheaper than gen ed classes at uni's by far. 
It's hard to not see it when you can see all the facebook profiles of people who graduated ahead of you and notice that not everyone got good jobs or are doing anything with their lives even if they went to college. And on sites like Reddit you can easily find stories of people doing jobs not related to their degree because they couldn't find anything.
If he's able to learn C++ well right off that bat that is great. I never had any programming until college and once I did get some taste of programming I loved it.If your child isn't keen to take on C++ (as it might be a little 'dry' for a youngin') you might look to the higher 'framework' languages (like swift, or .net framework with C#) which don't get into the dirty parts that C++ will have, but will increase his interest in programming. I hope your son is enjoying programming. I love the ability to 'make solutions' that programming allows.Good Luck!
Been there!Rejected for an internship and they actually wrote in their letter that they wanted someone with more experience. (Joke's on them, though -- a month later I was accepted for a full-time position with a more established company in the same field, and a few years after that, the company that rejected me went belly-up.) 
Most males use suicide such as hanging or guns which will kill you pretty quick and usually works. Females tend to use something like OD on pills or slitting wrists which is slower and is less reliable? (If that's the right word for it)
Fuck that, if I'm locking myself inside on my own, its going to be the cheapest, nastiest vodka I can stomach.
Man i want a shogun
Worked for a company that was working for Dell. Part of my job was to remote into other computers to do stuff and fix issues.Took about 2 or so months for them to allow me Internet access. Yet they still couldn't work out why I didn't do work during that time, even though they had been told numerous times.Yeh I worked in a place that didn't want to give me Internet access to do a job that requires the Internet.  
We all appreciated you in school.
VPN, not even once! 
Our senior ditch day was ruined because our "valedictorian" had her mom ask the school if it was an excused absence. Are you fucking kidding me?? The answer was in the name!
Not to mention the poor janitors. 
You mostly get girls in underpants with those search words. It is important to be able to use google in a good way, so you need to have a talk with him.
...since parents aren't doing it.I had the first "talk" with my son at 10. (Basic plumbing, dangers of becoming a young father, and mention of disease and the possibility of his weiner falling off.) Small discussions and questions along the way since. We'll have the final talk this year as he turns 13. (Foreplay, what diseases and why you might wish they actually made your weiner fall off, consent and the danger of being labeled a sex offender, emotional harm, etc.)
... I'll give you an upvote, but I'm not happy about it.
As long as he seeds he's alright with me!
Yeah he'll be taking Java and Python in high school, but until I can get him into a programming classroom I figured I'd try to teach him nuts and bolts stuff. He builds computers with me so memory management during software development is something I want him to understand/think he can understand. 
I beleive this is correct, in most cases women feel they need to leave peaceful, where men are more likely to just end it quick and easy.  
You can have a shotgun
Wow. That's... really damn stupid. 
There's some sleeper IT guys in school administration.  It's a steady paying gig with regular hours that you're usually doing by yourself, and with little supervision.  For someone coming out of corporate life it's easy enough to look past the pay cut and take the easy pope gig, and get paid to troll high school students all day.  
> Jesus, schools are getting really strict these days.Eh... it depends how tech-savvy they are I think.When I was in HS someone working on the school website set IE's home page to a network drive location. I got in trouble for "hacking" the network when I launched IE on the same machine.Who needs proper security when you can just punish students who expose your lack of security?In general the only thing I learned in computer classes there is that I already knew more than the teacher and she thought she knew more than me.(This was ~2002 or 2003.)
How was it ruined? Just ditch like normal. Them knowing ahead of time or not doesn't change anything.
'Oh, Honey'
"Son, your bad spelling and lack of keyword knowledge will never show you a quality vagina."
This is exactly the kind of thing that shows what is wrong with some parents. They think their child has looked up porn and they're mad? I assume you were a teenager when this happened.
The only talk I ever got was when my dad told me "If you get a girl pregnant, you don't have to marry them.  Pay for an abortion, take care of the kid, be a father, whatever, but only marry someone if you actually want to marry that person.  You can be a parent without having to be married to the other parent.  Both sides being happy for themselves is best for the kid."
We got the cops called on us as kids probably around 13 or 14 for hitting Crab Apples with golf clubs to clear out of our neighbors yard. Which the neighbor asked us to do because the bees/wasps love them. So we decided hitting them with golf clubs was the most fun option. Crochety old neighbor next door called up the cops and the cop came and was like "Yeah so you guys have permission to clear these out? Did he say with golf clubs? No? Well... Carry on I guess" Old ladies with too much time on their hands are the worst.
Unlock your phone so I can illegally search it or I'm going to arrest you! 
Aye, that be the code
I work at a 300,000-employee firm. The quantity of situations here where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing is overwhelming. Sadly, a report of a person who was disallowed access to the very thing they needed to perform their job duties no longer surprises me at all. 
>  get paid to troll high school students all day.Is this the revised version of The American Dream?
Who is this hacker VPN and do teens ingest it anally with tampons? News at 11.
At my school, when the administration caught wind of a skip day, they would enforce rules very strictly for an unexcused absence, meaning your teachers had to give you zeros for anything missed that day and it also opened you up to getting put into detention.I more than made up for that time my senior year when I'd skip out on pep rallies. Not too upset about not having a skip day.
Your dad is a wise man. I've watched several people ruin their lives doing exactly this. Don't compound your mistake by tying yourself to the wrong partner. 
Is there a law on this, so I can actually source it instead of a random Reddit comment?
I hadn't done coke at this time in my life, yet. It was old spice original. I always keep a stick in my car.
They're more like guidelines.
> get off my LANftfy
IT guy here, though not at a high school. Can confirm, living the dream shitposting on reddit all day.
"we believe the new drug 'VPN' has been sold to children by 'The 4Chan' more tonight on 'The Factor'..."
Fuck, senior skip day was a set day every year and the teachers mostly planned around it at my school.
Son, your search history is a disgrace. What is this, amateur hour? 
Yeah but the high from a single whiff of Old Spice Original is enough of a gateway drug that it's clearly to blame for your current coke habit.
Found the leecher boys!!
IMO this is the most brutal and demoralizing thing I've read in this thread.  Even if you love your job and this happens it's hell. 
I don't know why but this was the only one that made me laugh out loud. 
I was thinking "for them to become intensely aware of everyone they've ever hurt," but this is even worse. 
How would that work if they were home alone? Would someone just break into their house exclusively to ask them questions?
Yeah, I can't imagine Mr. Salt n' Glass Penis-Tube up there sleeps well at night.
You monster
You have to let them get some sleep, otherwise they'll die from sleep deprivation.Let's make it random whether the scream goes off or not. Maybe 1 out of 10 times. Enough so that on the outside they appear to be functioning normally but they're being slowly driven insane by Satan jacking their Bluetooth speaker.
But wouldn't getting half a boner be an awkward situation, thus giving you a full boner? 
Oh. Now i see.. i have that curse
Sounds like my average day already 
So you're giving them a Time Warner subscription?
Plenty of people around here stay with sticky hands all the time. This is Reddit brah. 
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little... but on pretzel day... well, I like pretzel day...
I'd prefer giving them that feeling of having to cough but no matter how much they cough nothing ever comes up. They keep coughing because they figure "This time, something will break loose and I'll have some relief" but no. No relief. They keep coughing because there's something in their lungs but it never comes out.
So a shitty YouTube video that always happens to be the only video of something you're trying to watch.
I have one of those stereotypical Asian parents. One of my friends would just randomly blurt out "Hey, when was that paper you needed to write due?" or "Are you ready for the math test?" and for the next week, my mom would be all "Pbghin! No playing video games, you have test coming up!" I'd correct her, but the idea of "there might be a test/paper/project due" outweighs the idea of "James is a shit-stirring asshole."
I have no feeling in parts of my right arm. No feeling, that is, except for when it's itchy. I can feel the itch, but *I can't feel it when I scratch*! It's like nothing is happening. And the itch just stays there for hours, maybe even a day or two. It's literally an itch I can't scratch and it drives me nuts!
And replace all of their salt with calcium bromide.
Time to castrate myself, because if people knew the sexual thoughts I was having then they'd run away.
Now that.... THAT is evil.
This is already my life. It's not so bad.
Hold off on this, I'm experimenting with behavioral altering by purposefully stumbling into them. Especially if they have their fucking laptop open walking around.
Sounds like a great idea for a chrome extension
A ring pop would be double the pleasure.
Just picturing this being implemented is hilarious. In places like the person's home or work, a device of some sort could be placed above the door to dispense glitter. For other places though I can only imagine someone hanging above the door waiting for this person to walk under or someone would have to follow the person with a bottle of glitter and sprinkle it on them every time. I think in order to not be predictable, each doorway would have to have a different person who pours the glitter. 
as someone with hyperhidrosis and social anxiety this is just another day for me 
Joke's on you; they will utilize this for free clean energy generation, making millions!!
Ouch! That's brutal.
So real glitter 
I like this. Very creative. You have a talent. You're probably on a CIA recruitment list somewhere.
Dementors...
Hello, Eddings fan! 
On the bit between your finger and thumb? Or between toes?
Alright, I thought we were doing funny comments here, not ones which hurt.
It Follows
So like reverse eyelashes?
I think somebody's already cursed me.
Had this happen to me IRL. I took sleeping pills until the problem went away. When I'd wake up, I'd often spend the entire time crying because it was so uncomfortable.Can confirm, this is the definition of hell. I have fonder memories of being stabbed.
Hearing that music would legitimately terrify me 
I hate you. 
This is fucking horrible, maybe the worse not violent one for me. I have a pretty serious drug problem and usually the only time ill stop and go home is after a few days because I smell, I don't know why but for me being smelly is maybe the. Most embarrassing thing, strangely more than being a drug addict. 
that's clever as fuck, and would be insanely inconvenient.
My wife and i agreed that if either of us was terminal, instead of stringing it out by "making us comfortable", we bail on the hospital, say goodbye to our loved ones, and go on a bender, that for the terminal one, wont end.
So... ulcerative colitis? I already have that. What else you got?
But if they read a left-sign (and understand right) they will try to go right but then go left because they always turn wrong, which makes them right again....?
Finally a good answer that is not a magical curse.
Honestly this one wouldn't affect me much.  Sometimes hearing a spoiler just makes me want to watch the movie even more to see the events leading up to it or afterwards. The exception would be movies with an important twist, spoilers suck for those. 
Pretty sure necropheliacs wouldnt have an undying fetish...
Ok, that's a unique one. But it's pretty evil too. The octopi would almost certainly die pretty much immediately so you're gonna have some nasty rotting octopus everywhere for a few weeks, at least until it rains.
Fuck. You. 
Ha, lucky for me I'm shit at electronics already. In fact the more blue smoke I inhlae, the worrse I become as eloctrics. bortle baby bortle

Eh. It's not as bad as it sounds.

That would eventually be fatal. Without any real sleep, your health will fail and you'll die.

Thank God I didn't have friends until my parents stopped giving a shit and moved on to shaming my brother for being a disgrace to the dynasty 
Have you tried using a mirror and scratching where the itch is on the other arm? You might be able to trick your brain into feeling the scratching. 
Can't,  I'm not giving anyone my asshole.
No, that's the itch moving around.
It's even worse if you have ticklish feet.
And replace all of their calcium bromide with sugar
Then it just turns into "Back before I was castrated, I'd totally have tapped that."

It would also be a neat party trick, though, so not all bad. Could even win some bets with it if you're clever enough. "I bet I could break this glass by dropping it an inch above this table.""Psh, no way, you're on!"ZIP! CRASH!
Absolutley.
That's my plan. I smoke and drink a lot and once I get cancer I'm just gonna ask for painkillers and go wild
oh no my plan is flawed. i've been cursed with stupidity on my death bed!! gosh darn that jim!
The obituary becomes a dating service. 
They're also insanely intelligent, so you might have a rough time finding the ones that didn't die immediately. If you have standing water anywhere, and they find it, it's their house now. 
I've suffered from it for over 40 years, just want to share with the person that I hate, he can fall asleep standing up.
It was a torture method, think used in WWII, make men get an erection, shove a glass tube in their penis.  Then you thwack it repeatedly to break the glass.  Then you force them to drink a lot of water.  Thus you end up pissing out through a glass shard filled urethra.  
This is the only time ever where Anal Shredding is preferable to anything.
Except that terminally ill adult will also have get to "Make-A-Curse"And thus the cycle continues.

It's worse than Time Warner. I didn't think that was possible, but it is. 
Yes like YouTube, and the ads will be THREE TIMES AS LOUD
And they have slightly too much salt.
Man, I hate that cough so much! Like every particle of air that dares try to remain in your lungs must be punished for its impudence and forced out. Then a huge gasp to try and suck enough air back in so that it can do it all over again.
My Asian friend married a white girl. His parents just started completely ignoring him.He considers it a mixed bag. 
Barbarian....who doesn't wear socks with shoes.  Hell i cant even step outside in my orange crocs without socks on. 
Doesn't work. I think it's because I only have some small patches where I have no feeling, with the areas around those patches able to feel that *something* is happening to my right arm. (Also, it's hard to scratch one arm without using the other arm...but it is amusing to try)
Have you tried treating for pinworms?

The problem, IIRC, is that they bound keyboard shortcuts to it, also put it in the same place as the previous button in the UI. Which was very stupid. Not to mention it muted future responses in the conversation, so not only do you look like a minion-loving idiot, you also missed all of the replies asking for clarification.Modern web apps have already conditioned users to ignore small changes over time.

Hey, Aynnjylla, how's it going?
Yeah. I've had fleas (a stray cat somehow got into my house and slept in my bed with me, I shit you not) and while they suck, it's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a video of a guy being stung by a bullet ant and I'm not taking my chances with something that has minimal mental capacity and can cause so much pain. Ant's definition of chill and my definition of chill probably vary

The only feedback you have is yourself. Imagine you can't talk to anyone. Look into a mirror, for about 2 minutes. Right in the eyes. You'll get bored and want to do something. Maybe you'll talk to yourself, or fix your hair. Now imagine there's no mirror. There is only the four walls and you.Isolation is a horrible curse that I wouldn't put on anyone. God may have mercy on the poor future astronauts who will explore space by themselves.

Very common, often undiagnosed/asymptomatic but quite horrifying, to me at least. Little staple-sized worms that live in your intestinal tract, and the females crawl out your balloon knot at night while you're sleeping, to lay eggs around the rim of your sphincter. Often causes intense itchiness and irritation.

I got over the girl I liked in HS when I went to college.

No kidding. My mother was on that shit for years. One night she did deep knee bends for two hours in the dark living room. Another night she asked me "where the black man was that liked your hair", when she hadn't had a black guest in years. Yet another night she tried to make a cake - in the morning there was pancake mix, an uncracked egg and maple syrup in a bowl on the counter. Ambien will fuck you up.

You can save a lot of money by just removing the exhaust system altogether.Just sit still with the windows closed and rev away for as long as you can. I meant want. As long as you want.

"Revving your engine" to kittens is pretty messed up
Ugh I had a neighbor with two ancient trucks that he parked in front of my house.  These trucks shared *one* battery, every time he wanted to switch trucks he'd have to switch the battery.  Hoods banging, engine revving to get things flowing, don't miss that at all.

Hello HR my old frieeend...
You get a lot of weekend warriors that have Harley's.  For one to have that Macho outlaw look while being dressed up in suits working at an office all day.And #2 is that Harley's cost a ton. To afford one you need a good job. Jobs that pay that well often are long hours or require you to take work home. This leaves the weekend as your only free time, often just Sunday mornings and afternoons.Harley's often cost as much or more than many cars.

Lol isn't the point in 'warming up' (esp fuel injected cars) to let the engine idle/drive at low rpm to get the oil warm? How can you think revving it high helps here?I know carbureted cars are a different story.
Yep, it's better to warm the engine while moving. Just keep the RPMs low for the first few minutes.

A Polo is a good choice for your first car. Drives nice, relatively cheap to drive and maintain. Look for one with a recently replaced timing belt and you should be safe from any expensive repairs for a while.
I really refuse to believe he's paying for maintenance quarterly.  I think he's just got a really bad exchange rate trading $500 for $0.25
I feel like you're not getting the respect you deserve. I want you to know I'm here clapping for you.

'96? Not even close. I got married and my new wife brought a '71 Toyota Corolla with her. Cardboard dash and interior. Black Vinyl upholstery. Manual choke lever on the dash (I am serious). Top speed 67. The cherry red had faded to an uneven light pink - EXCEPT the trunk which had to be repainted (in America) after my she had locked the keys in it with wine at 1ge 17 and got her older sister's pos bf to crowbar it open. Claimed ignorance so insurance fixed it.But to be fair, it stopped running so I sold it to a friend at work for $50 and some weed. So you probably still win.

Damn. That guy was fully responsible for his own death, you just happened to be there. Lucky he didn't take you with him.It's a shame, but double the speed limit in the middle of the night with no lights? 100% his fault.
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown?
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide. It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault. 
I wonder how many lives you unknowingly saved by repoing someone's car.
I'm so sorry. She sounded like a sweet person. 
Who was "they"? 
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.   I'm sorry for your loss man.
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you? 
This was my thought too. All too often love gives someone rose-tinted glasses, so it seems likely he did something to damage that. 
They replaced the street lights that day, pretty fucked up it took a death to save a few cents. 
I don't know the full details on that, but I do know that the chat logs were saved so the blame was really taken off of us. We demonstrated meteorologically why we wanted hail. His argument was "I have more stripes, get rid of it." I just wound up having a discussion with my commander about it in private and he basically said that no one pulls rank on the weather. Next time this happens, we have to stick to our guns and don't get pushed around by a "senior" forecaster. 
It should have but in most cases the staff to aid ratio is ridiculous. Imagine being left to care for 33 people that's what our third shift does anywhere from 25 to 33 people most of them total care several are bariatric residents. CNA'S are not valued enough for what they do.
I understand that that would've probably happened but I still wish I could've helped somehow.
It was a very small town and the driver was old. Still no excuse. Things can happen. 
Exactly. Think of what would happened if he drove drunk with another passanger. Him, his passanger, and any number of people in 1 ir more vehicles coukd have been killed. Likely, at least one life ended up being saved that day.
Or suicidal, even drunk me would probably look for a more comfortable place to pass out than train tracks. 
The gun is always loaded.It's not a toy, end of story. A hunter should know better than to give a firearm to a kid outside a safe environment (shooting range).
This woman obviously believes she has nothing to live for, so I second the 'she's not fucking around' angle. It makes me sad that the mother could never find closure or place responsibility where it should have been, and that it's not allowing this person to move on with their lives.
And the lives of anyone else he may have tried to abduct after her.
Sorry for your loss. <3
Like shit, he has a family and kids just like she did. He wrote a note to the her family apologizing but they never responded. He wasn't drunk and he is kind of goofy guy. IMO, it could have been avoided, he could of been going slower but she did not look up for anyone coming her way. Ive seen people on the mountain collide before; it looked like any of the other times.  
Good point. I was at a pool party for 6-7 year olds, and I remember diving into the pool and accidentally landing on one of the other kids who was lurking underneath the water. One of the adults saw this and pulled the kid out of the water. I am really thankful to have had that supervision.
We were at the ocean a few days before my sister's wedding. We had been body surfing the waves earlier hut everyone was up on the beach relaxing. We look out and see people yelling and waving and having a good old time out there. After like 5 minutes we realized they were actually in distress and took off into the water and saved them. It was crazy how close we were to just watching them drown.
Hey, no ones said it yet so I'll say it. Congratufuckinglations, you're strong as hell and I hope you continue strongly on your new journey! I wish the best for you and wish you well along the way! Keep counting those months, soon they'll turn to years. 
It wasn't even a mistake. It was the correct answer with the given information.  
The thing that makes it feel like my fault is that after his second DUI he asked me to keep his gun so it wasn't an option. He then asked for it back a few months later to go shooting, I reluctantly gave it back to him and said to give it back afterwards. He said he was getting counseling and other things to help with his troubles. I would compare him to Robin Williams, he was typically the life of the party and could cheer anyone up. It just hurts knowing the last thoughts about me were that I hated him. I didn't/don't, I was just frustrated with him because I cared about him.
Its easier to cope with the loss if there is some sort of scapegoat. They probably know on the inside he didnt do anything. And social pressures and not seeing the signs are why he'd blame himself If I were to guess. But the last part is very true. He obviously had the  intent to commit suicide, he would've done it one way or another. 
Grief obeys no logic.
Drugs. Alcohol and pcp. I could smell alcohol, of course. I didn't know about the drugs until a while after.
Yeah it's just that I felt at fault, and people drilled into my mind that it was me. Heck, even the local paper at the place said that the accident happened as a result of poor conduct on our behalf. When you see that in a newspaper it really fucks you up. 
I think this is very important.This reminds me of a post here where a little girl had to have surgery and she was not allowed to eat the day before. Of course her parent gave her food and she almost died.People often think that these questions/advices are "just protocol". It can help to remind them they might die.
If they've got something to hide, then they will hide it.  If you're lucky, you *might* get the truth if you get loved ones away from them, but then you also might not.
What makes it even more of a dark memory for me was that he died being totally loving towards me, bringing me snacks and drink on a large tray which im certain contributed to him not seeing the controller.
This and suicide by cop are just despicable acts leaving monstrous guilt and pain
I am okay about it now! It was a very, very long time ago. The wisdom of age has only reaffirmed my decision. It really did save my mom... she was in such a terrible situation, emotionally. If you could only see how good she is today... I don't know what she would be like now if she was still around him
It always seemed like I killed him in my 9 year old perspective. Like I was sitting there watching as he died thinking he was ok
No. Not following basic road rules as a driver is the stupid fucking thing you can do.
Why the fuck would the pedestrians walk over a red light when there is traffic?Is it just the German inside me that doesn't think this is weird?
Probably quite a few.  Roughly a third of our repos have "empty alcohol cans/bottles" on the inventory list.  I've never really thought about it until just now, but that does pop up quite often.  Thank you for pointing this out to me.  
I think it was a term the nurses used to not tell me he had died. I was 17 at the time.They said "lo vinieron a buscar" which roughly translates to "(they) came to pick him up" as if "they" was his family, which he never talked about
He was the most lucid of all the people living there. He was the only one that could walk without help, and that only time we talked he was so depressed and told me how the nurses drugged them to sleep and how horrible that place was.And I thought painting something would make him happy.
I really hope so, although I haven't seen it that way before. Thanks.
If I remember correctly, I actually ran after her at some point, but she was so panicked she kept shouting "Go away!" whenever I tried to get close. 
Here in Canada, if you open your car door, you're responsible. You are required to look to be sure it's safe, since someone walking or riding along can't predict when someone will open their doors. 
Yes, as a family member of someone with Schizophrenia I cannot thank you enough.
My girlfriend gets mad when i tell her to take her feet off the dashboard when i'm driving. Every time i have to explain to her what would happen to her legs if we were to get in an accident.
unrelated, but during my time in high school, a kid shot himself due to being bullied incessantly. kid was a freshman, and it seems that after he died, everyone apparently was his friend afterwards. even the kids that fucked with him. might be a coping mechanism, might be something else more selfish, either way, he suddenly gained a lot more friends in death than in life.
I Actually learned this from my grandmother when i was 13 
Life long asthmatic that has it under control now. You are totally correct. It is often exercise enduced or can be triggered in other ways but it is a pretty quick thing, not delayed. Not your fault at all. 
Also, he should've gone to the hospital. It's unfortunate to say that he may have done it to himself
Fuck dude. 
Doesn't even need to know the month. He'll, they can get away with "Accident x city x month/year".I'm an emergency medical dispatcher and we never get to know the outcomes of the calls we take so it's something we often check.
The second time a passenger ... critiques my driving, my go to is, "Do you want to fucking drive? Because I can pull over and let you have the driver's seat."My wife was mad at me for three days, but she hasn't done that shit since.
This right here is the truth of the situation.
Exactly. You did what you thought was best and a terrible accident, well out of your control, occurred. I wish you the best and I hope that you can learn to handle and overcome that pain one day. Much love.
I agree. Couldn't anyone just order an arduino online? I'm sure they're really easy to get anywhere. 
There is. That's why it's something I hate myself for. 
Yeah like maybe for her it was kind of okay to be the receiving end of her husband's abusive behavior but after knowing that he has also been harming their grandchildren, she goes that's it, it has got to stop.
Thank you for the condolences, but my real message was, in instances like this, "blame" can't be directed - understanding the actual causes is almost as complex as understanding the results, and you were unfortunately caught up in a terrible story outside your own. I hope you've "moved on" as best as you can and have come to realize none of this was your fault - you were an unfortunate victim in someone else's story, and I hope it doesn't follow you
Unfortunately it's called Blood Priority, very well known in the aviation industry.   
This is the part I don't get: Who cares if they object, regardless of their rank. You are the forecaster. It's your forecast (your subordinate's, in this case) with your initials on it. So long as your forecast is consistent with the operational area forecast, note the objections in your forecast worksheet and leave your forecast as is. If it doesn't verify, then be prepared to write up the missed forecast review. Too f-ing bad for the guy that doesn't want to brief it.
No, they certainly are not. When I was a brand new nurse CNAs saved my ass on multiple occasions. Cannot thank them enough for all they do!  
What's always gotten me is that we consider euthanizing animals that are in pain humane, to the point where the technical designation for euthanizing a laboratory animal that can no longer ethically be used (tumors are too large, surgeries aren't healing right, etc...) is "humane endpoint". Yet euthanizing a person is considered monstrous. I just get really hung up on the level of cognitive dissonance implied by the terminology.
My great grand mother passed a few years ago, and it was one the most..  non-sad? funerals I'd ever been to.  I mean, we all loved her and missed her, but for about a year before that every time you left it would be like;"See you at Christmas grandma!""Oh, I hope not."She was there, mentally.  She was mostly blind, from cataracts.  And she was just..  ~~waiting~~hoping to die.  And she let her wishes be known.I just wish we were in a society where one could just.. opt out, in a legal, humane, acceptable way.
As an adult with training, maybe.As an eight year old? Not a chance. The *best* you could have *maybe* done was stay back and encourage him. But most likely you would have simply witnesses him going under for the last time first hand. Not a memory you need.Sorry you lost him that way.
I can't drink because I become deeply suicidal. I keep it at bay sober.
Yeah as a non-firearm user this is the rule I live by. Can it fire a bullet?  If so, assume it's loaded.
Oh I agree. The fact that he has restraining orders against her and the police don't do anything about those threats is a joke. They are legitimate. I understand she lost a child, but also, this man did not kill her daughter.
We had a pool party for my daughter's 6th grade graduation party and we hired a lifeguard so the adults could relax a bit and not have to stand by the pool the whole time.
That was me when I was a teenager.  Was at the beach and swam out to a buoy -- I wasn't (and still am not) a good swimmer, and by the time I got there, I was completely exhausted.  I was hanging onto the buoy while frantically waving to a passing boat.  The passengers smiled and waved back.  Somehow I managed to swim back to the beach.  My body felt like it was on fire and I could see my entire chest move with my heart beat.
I've lost two close family members this way. Not the exact same living situation, but same behavior and end result. I'm sure if they were still around they would forgive you and know you were right not to let them take advantage of you. I hope you're taking care of yourself and are able to let go of feeling guilt, I know sometimes it's hard.
It is so important what you said, "Its easier to cope with the loss if there is some sort of scapegoat" this applies to SO many situations in life. For example, I got dumped because there was someone else is easier to accept than I got dumped because I was not the one he wanted. 
Fuck the media, they always make up shit. You were definitely not at fault here. 
I had a Spanish teacher in high school that was an anesthesiologist in Brazil before he moved to the US and told us about this happening. When they intubate someone they will gag when you're taking it out then if they ate or drank they will puke and immediately aspirate it back to their lungs and basically drown. 
My dad's a cardiologist and he calls this the "door stop". He's been practicing for almost 50 years, and says when someone is leaving his office, if they hesitate for even a fraction of a second at the door as they leave the exam room and don't sneeze, there's something they didn't tell you and you need to calmly figure out what it is. 
trains too
But surely they should have warned you, and told you to turn him on his side if he choked? If you weren't there, it would have happened either way. If they had some kind of baby monitor, shouldnt  they have come in to check on him? They probably blame themselves but took it out on you as a coping mechanism. 
You likely did him a huge favor. If I ever end up in a nursing home I hope someone will be there for me to do the exact same thing. Once all the quality of one's life is gone, remaining on earth is sheer torture.
oh god i am so sorry. how is your relationship nowadays?
Sadly lots of deaths occur from trying to save time  
that's messed up..
Can't remember which poet said something like this:*We die three deaths**The first is when we take our last breath**The second is when our body is laid to rest**And the third is when our name is spoken for the last time*I think remembering is the most important thing.
I mean, if they were familiar and capable enough with Arduino to make a bomb using it, then it probably wasn't the only Arduino bomb they had made. Seems unlikely that it was the same one. Not to mention that they would have created a bomb either way.
>  I hope you've "moved on" as best as you can In the least callous meaning way possible--I have moved on in many ways. The event shaped a part of my life that I wont forget, for better or for worse. I am much more sympathetic to people though that are inadvertently exposed to tragedy that they had to decision in becoming a part of. 
From a brand new lpn that still hasn't transitioned out of cna mode. Thank you.
I've thought about every possible thing that could've happened differently and that one has been hard to think about. I wish I saw him one more time since I just turned around and he was gone but seeing him go under would be too much for me. 
As someone raised with guns who owns multiple this is me even to the annoyance of others. I can unload the gun myself and hand it to someone to look at and if they point it near me I will scold them. 
Yeah, the main red flag is the arms. They don't thrash or wave, they instinctively slap the water horizontally, like they're imitating a bird. You can sort of tell that they have no control over their body, that they've just completely focused on not going under.
When you are in trouble in the water youre supposed to raise your arm with a closed fist so it doesnt look like you are waving. There needs to be more info about this sort of thing.
my mom was murdered and I was there and a week later when I went back to school everyone was asking me questions and the news made up shit saying she was hit by a baseball bat to the head. We didn't even own a baseball bat he just used his fists and punched her in the temple but yeah media is retarded.
I'm cringing at the thought of this. OWWWW. WOWWW
I agree theres a look that patients get if youre watching closely. I had a guy in a similar situation, denied with his wife there. He looked a little funny. Was going to apply nitro paste which wouldve been a similar effect. Didnt order paste, sent spouse on fools errand: guy had seen a prostitute the night before, hed used viagra. Had i not been looking right at em, id have missed it, and im pretty sure he wouldve lied. 
Me: Do you have any medical problems?78 year old Patient: Nope. None.Me: What do you take the Lipitor,  Coumadin and Metformin for?78 year old Patient: For my High Cholesterol, Afib, I have had a heart attack, PE. Oh and I'm diabetic. 
Balance and falls in general are so overlooked by people in good health. Living in the Northeast, I probably slip on ice 3-4 times a week during the winter. Another 20 years and that slip that I regained my balance on is me falling on my ass. Another 20 years after that and that's a broken hip. 
Train suicide can leave an incredibly gruesome scene as well. 
That makes sense it was just hard to process as death I understood but hadn't experienced it on a personal level and felt liable for the kid in the situation, i guess it was the parents fault in the end
Everyone wants someone to point the finger at. 
It's true, after all quality of life is gone, every day is Hell. My father dealt with MS and Tinitus for a long long time waiting until my big brother and I were grown enough to understand and living our own lives before he took his.  He was unhappy for atleast a decade.  He went out with some dignity, he knew he wasn't getting any better.  Still, the best man I've ever known.
Uh... so in an unrelated incident 4 years ago right before I graduated high school, my parents kinda, for the lack of a better phrase, kicked me out? I wasn't able to do very well in programming like I had wanted and didn't build the prerequisites to go to UBC, and they basically went ballistic and never want to see me again. I'm living alone right now, and my parents haven't responded to my contact attempts since. I'm not sure if they're even in the country any more. 
It actually better knowing,my mom and I have had a complicated relationship,She said that she loved me(like any mom would) but could tell there was some form of resentment and its better knowing where the resentment came from 
Well I think there are other sources. After all, the Taliban seem to have access to all sorts of weapons, so I don't think an open-source microcontroller would be too difficult for then to get their hands on.
I do hope you're able to forgive your eight year old self. Your cousin wouldn't want you to feel bad forever. 
If I ever hand someone my gun I always double check to make sure it's unloaded then before I hand it to them I tell them to keep it pointed at the ground and act like it's loaded. Safety is key. 
honestly I'm a lifeguard and I've never heard that. That's really good advice. 
The media has a tendacy to juice up the unverifiable details.
I'm cringing that a Brazilian anesthesiologist found it more cost effective to teach Spanish (don't they speak Portuguese in Brazil?) than to re-qualify to practice medicine in the U.S.  Couldn't even be a nurse anesthetist?  We throw out a lot of immigrant expertise...
Yup, healthy as a horse. No reason to be seeing me. Good day, sir.
Most suicidal people don't want to leave a mess. But sometimes you just can't think of any other way. And depression changes your mind. When you go into a depressive fugue it's like the whole world is literally gray and grainy. The person in your head isn't you anymore.
that's for sure, I mean who the hell writes a jaywalking ticket after such an accident?
My father passed in 2013. He had MS and had completely lost all use of his body in the 10 years before he died. He used to tell me that it took everything he had in him not to ride his electric wheelchair into traffic while he could still use his hand. I was young and selfish and thought it was horrible for him to say that. Now that I'm a little older I am a huge advocate of assisted suicide. I don't want anyone to suffer the way he did. Sorry to hear about your dad, I understand why he chose what he did and I love that you still admire him! 
Sorry, your parents sound like assholes. 
I can see that. It would be better to know in that case. 
The number of NYC taxi drivers with graduate degrees from their home countries is really rather astounding. 
I would add one should also disclose herbal or nontraditional medicines because some do interact with other  drugs. At one point, I used St John's Wort, and because I had heard of some interactions, I made a point of always disclosing. I also found that even the more skeptical health professionals would still rather know everything a patient is taking.
Jumping in front of a train was honestly one of the leading ideas I had when I was having suicidal thoughts.  I **never** wanted to leave any kind of mess for anyone, but I figured that with a train, at least my parents wouldn't have to see it and try to clean up.  They'd also not have to live around the area where I'd died.  Those were very big positives in the "death by train" column for me.  Plus the fact that it could give them hope that it was a tragic accident, if that helped them cope.
Yeah....particularly a dick move when it's the boyfriend of a girl who just fucking died. As if that guy doesn't have enough on his plate. Like all the guilt of not moving his girl, or being more careful about crossing the street or any of that.
I can't come with any argument against that, but honestly I don't think there's any possible positive outcome for me to hold a grudge against them. I might as well be dwelling on that asshole bully in grade 4. Note: I don't excuse my parents' behavior, and know that they treated me horribly, I'm just saying I don't think it's healthy for me to really hate them. All I want to do is just move on right now. 
Yeah, Japanese, but first generation Canadian, and that Asian parent stereotype had to come from somewhere. 
Every cabby I've had was usually an engineer.
Thank you for that; as a pharmacist I'd like to point out that taking St John's Wort with common medications like antidepressants can potentially cause serotonin poisoning, seizures and death. Considering it's a natural, over the counter supplement used to TREAT depression (amongst other things), the amount of people who begin taking it to help their mood and don't think about how it will affect their other medications is astounding
I'm sure the cops did it to relieve the liability from OP who has to deal with having accidentally killed someone.  It  would help him if it went to trial had the family sued civilly. It would remove at least a portion of the responsibility from OP.It sucks but it's part of the process.  
You've got a really level head and good outlook. Harbouring a grudge does you no good. Keep on pushing forward and working towards your goals. Best of luck in life man. PS shout-out to BC!
no kidding - like textbook. From another Canadian, hope things are goin alright mon frere. 
I hope his prostate falls out
Did she tell you why she ghosted?!
But why did your roommate do it.
They were totally different songs. You see, yours were like "ding ding ding ding da da ding ding". But theirs were like "da ding ding ding da da ding ding". Completely different songs.
... I would have shown up forsure.
I stayed friends as best I could with an ex of mine. On the surface, things seemed pretty bad as she started dating my roommate. But on the inside, she was conspiring with another friend of mine to keep me single. They told the girl I crushed on that I was just using her to make my ex jealous. Made that girl cry. Eventually made me cry after all was said and done.It's been a year and a half and I have no regrets. The other "friend" was a shitty person anyways. Edit 4/1/17: I have not forgotten these events, though I legitimately wish everyone the best despite this.
If dude had depression issues then this is plausible. It's shitty but plausible. 2 depressed people are much worse than just 1. 
Raise your hand if you can see a chunk of pencil lead under your skin years after getting stabbed. 
Do they know you know? Or do you have a chance to mess with them back?
There are two sure ways to lose a friend.  One is to loan money to a friend and the other is to borrow money from a friend.
That is particularly fucking evil.  Acid tends to make _most_ people really sweet and vulnerable.  These people must have been born evil.
This thread makes me feel better about not having friends in the first place...
That's when you melee him in the back, and start an impromptu deathmatch for 30 minutes in the middle of your legendary campaign. Until truce is called and you continue the campaign for another 30 minutes until the same thing happens again.
cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you!
I hope you don't hold it against him/her.  Risk alliances are supposed to end in betrayal.
To be honest I was very angry about it, and very hurt but I had so much to do with just picking up the pieces that I couldn't even focus on them. After the graduation, what I really took from the situation is learning that I never want to make anyone feel the way I felt when they hurt me. I've been more open and more strict about honoring commitments and making sure people I care about can count on me when they are helpless. It would be nice to see where this attitude gets them in a few years, but I think it's best to try and cast them away from my thoughts.
"You know, it's funny; when you look at someone through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags."
That can happen??? Oh god!
And let's hope they always do.
Or straight up call the police.
And don't forget to punch him in the face!
16 years later is the perfect time to exact revenge.
Not OP, but my guess is that his roommate was a rapist pedophile and wanted to get the suspicion off of him.Or maybe he was just an asshole.
Found Vanilla Ice.
Well, that's something
But the legend of the rent, was WAY PAST DUE 
If only I was a red head. 
That's basically what happened. But that was high school which was about 15 years ago for me. 
I'm just impressed by the commitment. He lost 100 pounds to ask someone out? Wow
She kinda was. Probably still is. 
or plant a nest of nats in her home
I mean, if there was free pizza, shit even I would show up in the weirdo's house.
Can't wait to read the new boyfriend's post in 6 months on the next thread like this...
That's exactly what I would have done in this situation and it's not like he'd have any right to be pissed if Op had done so.  Makes me wonder if that guy picks his "friends" based on who he knows won't challenge him over BS like this.
yes 100%. I dated someone once who was devastatingly handsome and whenever we talked about marriage he said "I don't believe in me wearing a ring, it's different for you, you have to". Thought that was a pretty big red flag.
 Yeah exactly.  When I figured out what she was doing I cut her out of my life like a tumor.  Didn't make it into a big scene filled with drama, just quietly turned and walked away from that friendship.  Don't need that in my life.  
Because he smelled something off early on and A) told me immediately he felt uncomfortable with stuff that was happening, stuff she was doing, ways she was contacting him etc and B) began documenting all communication she had with him,  messenger logs, texts etc and proactively gave them to me *before* she tried to take pieces of them and show them to me to put him in a bad light (which she did).  I didn't ask him to or anything.   He could tell she was behaving oddly about stuff and kept me in the loop.  That good communication probably single handedly saved our relationship.    
My boyfriend and I both have repeated lapses of depression... Most of the time is fine.... But sometimes it gets really ugly.When he is trying to cheer me up, it's usually okay. But if he gets into a funk I can't pull him out of, I get really depressed and sometimes breakdown for multiple days because of the feeling of unrelenting guilt that I can't help him the way he helps me.As much as I love my boyfriend. My depression makes it really hard to be near him sometimes.
[](/cocosad)Hard to judge on a case-by-case basis, but I get what you're saying. Helping someone with depression, especially when they're depressed for extremely long periods of time, can be very draining. 
Oh yeah after what she pulled off.. never again. Wedding happened January 23, and she still hasn't said anything. Doubt that she ever will. 
Not to mention a VP shouldn't be going directly to an employee if there's a manager between them.  Chain of command is important in any business structure and both his former friend and the VP broke it by circumventing the manager.  Shitty deal.
So many people try to deny that this happens, it's refreshing to see people talking about this type of behavior.I've been the above board, blunt, "I'm just here to work" type of person my whole life, but the type that wants to create havoc for no reason has been a burden through most of my professional life. The less you participate, the more they single you out with this shit, it seems.
Haha thanks.Yeah it went down something like this: she told me to watch out because she had a friend in law school. And I'm thinking, "bitch please, I know the people that teach at your friend's law school." Really made me appreciate how connected Jewish communities are.

This happened almost 9 years ago (this coming April). My dad was overcome with grief and I was trying to hold us together, so I don't know if that even crossed his mind. It's thoughtful of you to post this and let me know. Thank you. 
No, we dated for about 2.5 years after that and then she moved across the country and I couldn't follow. Kept in touch for the first year and a half before drifting away for good.
Yep, I've learned to be careful about cross-pollinating my various friends and social circles. You never know how things might collapse in the future.
What's code for "we got a new drummer"? 
The news is out
Yeah, but then they got back together and broke off Satan's horn in a Rock-off.
I feel like maybe I have some insight . . . Musicians, as people, tend to fucking suck, at least when it comes to behaving responsibly. Especially within the world of punk/rock/etc., a vast majority of musicians are more concerned with the cult of themselves than they are with writing music. People and relationships tend not to matter enough to do the right thing. source: been playing in bands for 15+ years 
Or he's plotting his revenge...
Yeah it still hurts if I'm being honest. I miss what we had. He's spoken about it to a few mutual friends and is all for moving on apparently, as it's 'ancient history' in his eyes... but once you lose trust in who you thought was your closest friend, there's not really any going back.It's not, and never was, about the money. Cheers.
This was back in 2002
That administration is everything that is wrong with education. There will always be individuals who bully and abuse, but when the administration protects them or punishes the victims, then that destroys everything.
Yes do this EXACTLY. Tag them on Facebook, tweet at them, tag them on insta, snap them. Wherever they are and whatever social media they are on, make a huge deal about sharing the same wedding anniversary and maybe the bitch will let it go.
I was stabbed in the hand with a pen by a girl in my class. She showed me her boobs a couple years later. We were cool after that.
Wow, she dropped so many hints and you didn't notice. Typical guy
I made it abundantly clear to them that I'm aware of what they did. Would having a third party send them a fake "local man found dead after harmful prank" news article be too much? 
You clearly haven't played Settlers of Catan with friends
You know those emails you get about avoiding obvious phishing links and keeping your password safe? That's the person they're for.
I wasn't concerned with the situation with the woman. That concerned both of us, but my family life/ethnicity/parentage and the like was fucked up.  
I once stepped barefoot onto a pile of fishhooks that was sitting on one end of the dock. I don't know why the guy thought leaving them there was okay, but it definitely was not. My brother spent the next hour pulling hooks out of my foot. 
Yeah, it's experiences like that which have made me cynical.  Also, I'm now the guy who will be first to turn up to a party or night out that someone else has organised, to help prevent exactly the sort of awkwardness that plagued me that night.
Quite safe.
I guess it would depend on who did the breaking up. If it was you, I can see you not caring. It would be hard to have a friend do that if you had been broken up with and had lingering feelings for the ex.
Wow I can't believe the prof didn't believe you but I hope karma gets to those people. 
"What happened to us?""Same thing that always happens. You didn't know me, then you fell in love with me, and now you know me."

It's 1:1 same psychology. Most basic example is random loot (one armed bandit, mobs in mmo's) as uncertain reward is known to cause a higher spike than certain and just in expectation of the possibility even if you don't receive it.
And steal his Runescape items!
Or maybe OP really is a rapist and a pedophile. The roommate did say "secretly." So if it *were* true, OP probably wouldn't tell us because it's a secret.

A friend of mine in college spend three months hardcore studying to learn sign language - basically all his free time that semester - to ask out a deaf girl he was crushing on. She ended up being gay. So he decided, hell, I already know sign language now, and changed his major from marketing to deaf special ed.
No, no no no. You'd better tell us about that marriage of his. Sounds fun.

Judging by how she handles things, I'd give it a lot less than 6 months
He deals in "business stuff" and "business stuff" accessories. 
As I told another person who accused me of dealing drugs, you're absolutely right! I sell tobacco for a living. Like actual tobacco. Djarums and Acid on the low end, Cohiba, Macanudo, Arturo Fuente, etc. on the high end. I'm actually not sure what my cheapest per gram item would be (probably my loose leaf stuff like fronto leafs). But I live above my shop (because that's been a dream of mine for most of my life). I love the commute, and I love the lifestyle. 
why would he even admit to that?
After I said that I didn't want to be in contact with the "friend," she claimed that I was stalking her. Like what.
Why were your ex gf, new gf, and her parents all at their house? 
That's a good man right there. Sorry it didn't work out.
This makes me think of my old roommates. They are absolutely perfect for each other, but both struggle with mental health issues, primarily depression. It's pretty easy for them to spiral. He is upset and She doesn't feel like she can help, which makes Her upset, which then makes Him more upset because he realizes that his depression has made Her upset and so on. Like you said they are mostly okay, but sometimes a minor incident will cause a week of them being down. They basically never get mad each other, but are sad at each other which is almost worse.
I work in mental health and you really need to set boundaries and be able to detach emotionally or you're gonna have a bad time when a patient doesn't succeed
Agreed. VP should've immediately contacted their direct superior and been like "why is this dumb fuck bothering *me* with this pointless bullshit? I have *real* work to do." 
They take it personally when you don't participate because they perceive that they're not worth your time- which is usually true.
"and here, take my nail bat"
Sounds like the afterlife in Remember Me, one of my favourite books as a teen (it's a Christopher Pike book). The person sees their entire life and realises everything good they did and everything bad. But they experience from the perspective of the person they helped or harmed, so they feel the good and the bad emotions exactly the same as the other person did.
"Our guitarist is busy."
They're playing without me.

He has low intrigue, so his plot MTTH is low.OP if you find yourself in an inn full of exploding manure in 20 years' time, you know what you did.
My friend wanted me to stop being so addicted to runescape and when I went to get food in the kitchen he sat at my computer and dropped all my armor (rune of course) and ever since then, I think back at it, and see it as more of a favor 
But what if he made it all up to trick you and over an elaborate scheme taking place over 20 years he will steal your identity and all your wealth just to buy weed?
>He's spoken about it to a few mutual friends and is all for moving on apparently, as it's 'ancient history' in his eyesIt's not really water under the bridge unless you say it is... he sounds like a twat to be honest.
I got stabbed in the hand with a pencil a few months before getting stabbed in the chest. 7th grade was not my favorite year. 
> Reminds me of some girl I knew in HS who stabbed her best friend with a syringe full of water because she "wanted to see what would happen."Man, teenagers do stupid shit and I hope she realizes someday how lucky she is, because 9 times out of 10 that will do nothing, but it *could* literally kill someone. Had she accidentally killed her friend she would have been fucked up forever

Oh god that sounds like us.The worst is when I realize it got set off my something little.
Exactly this. A competent VP would ask this person if they had discussed the matter with their direct supervisior. This kind of stuff, in my opinion, is not my direct concern.  This is a sign that the VP is either excessively controlling or doesnt have anything to do. Probably the latter.
"actually, i think it's around the time we go to war with hell anyway. jesus, sound the horns. and get me my nail bat."

Damn that's a stone-cold lesson
Possible. I'll keep an eye on him.

In middle school I know somebody that put a bunch of Germ-X in somebody's drink because he thought it would be funny. He got suspended and then had to give a speech to our entire grade (during lunch, with a microphone) about the dangers of ingesting Germ-X and how what he did was wrong.

Yeah I know. It's dumb as hell. But when you're young and naive, you'll believe a lot of what adults tell you. I walked out of that office feeling like I did something wrong. In retrospect, he was just an asshole and I didn't really do anything wrong.  If somebody tried to tell me that now I'd promptly tell them to fuck off. 
I've been touched by your kids and I'm sure they've been touched by me
Huh. I would have gone with congratu-fucking-lations. 
Full character immersion with the "medamnit" and all, good job.

I'm the same way. I'm an Android enthusiast. I personally won't use any other phone. I couldn't care less if you use an iPhone, Samsung, HTC, hell or even a Windows phone. Just don't be a dick about it. I hate when people with iPhones just want to talk shit to me about my phone. That's the only time that I ever say anything to people about their phone. When they say something to me, I typically like to destroy their beliefs around their phone because they've decided to be that guy.

I started my first office job recently, at a subsidiary of a fortune 100 company. I work with 5 other people and they're all older than 40 and have been working there for several years. Most of the job *should* be done through computers, but several aspects are still done with a pen and paper because they can't adapt to the technology. I had to show someone how to download files from an email and attach them in another. They had worked there for YEARS. I did all of the daily tasks in under an hour and they were amazed. I just don't understand how huge companies are able to function.

The worst is when millennials themselves write these kinds of articles. Way to throw your entire generation under the bus assholes.
Can educators please be exempt from this? because they actually affect our day to day lives in real and meaningful ways. For me it's more about kids literally self diagnosing themselves with disorders they don't have so that they can have a fidget spinner in class. No, DeMarcus, you do not have autism or ADHD. Besides, kids who actually need fidgets have very different ones, like pieces of felt or differently textured cubes that have actually been proven to help and are relatively innocuous.
It's been getting less violent but in exchange, we're now able to see every violent thing that happens.

Yeah, my orthodontist was always 20-40 minutes late. However if I show up five minutes late my appointment is cancelled and i'm charged?! Hate this double standard. However if it a first-come-first-served time deal then I have no issue with a long queue. I'm part of it after-all. It does annoy me when people bitch about traffic, like they aren't directly contributing to it. 
I had a bunch of trophies that were participation because I was really bad at the sport. I wanted to get rid of them or move them so I would have space in my room. My mom was angry because I earned them. I didn't. I just showed up and pulled the team down because I hated the sport and I wanted to quit but they wouldn't let me. 
I've got a MacBook and a Windows desktop, they're both great. I use them for different things, they're both great machines that I don't regret investing it at all.

Oh I love the ones that say "I'm never flying this airline again" out loud when it's something like a delay to the gate or a weather diversion that has nothing to do with that specific airline. 
1. There's a term, it's called "Gate Lice".2. For those with crap status, getting on as soon as possible reduces the possibility you'll have to gate check your carry-on. Doesn't impact me as I always check my bag for trips longer than 1 night, which is almost all of mine, but as long as airlines charge for checked baggage and don't strictly hold to their own carry-on rules, there will be validity to this strategy. Edit for clarification: The charge is for checked baggage at the counter, not the gate.
The way umpires are treated is horrible, we have huge umpire burnout were I work. The players/spectators/coaches think they have the right to abuse our officials if they think the ref made the wrong call.
When I was like 9 there was a kid on my team with 1 arm (no idea if he was in an accident or it was a birth defect or what) and I remember one game he was in the on deck circle taking practice swings and his mom came up to the fence and started scolding him about him not having a hit all season and that he better get one that at bat.  The kid had 1 fuckin arm, the fact that he could even swing the bat 1 handed at that age was good enough in my eyes.
This. There's been countless times I've only had a carry on but because I didn't assert my place in line they ran out of overhead room and I had to check it in. It adds around 20-30 mins to wait for it at baggage claim when I could have been out the door.
So they RSAD about the weather?
To be fair, if it's 25 or 28 or 30 the result in the UK is the same:Overweight men will still walk around with their shirts off. Every single woman under a certain age will wear one of those long, maxi dresses, regardless of whether they owned one before this week. The Sun will have a picture of some students in bikinis on Brighton beach, together with a 'heat' based pun. The entire population of Scotland will turn bright red and shed their skin.

Bottle flipping is timeless I was doing that shit in middle school like 15 years ago. The only difference is now everyone films it like it matters.
Yup. Now we have people who decide which violent things we see, because there's not enough time to see them all, which we could do if we had the time.
Also as a child you're often more shielded from seeing the violence so tend to think back to those times as peaceful 
No.. you calm down.

As odd of a trend as it is... it is nice seeing my one fifth grader who, according to his IEP, is required to have a small box of fidgets.... well, all of a sudden he is a cool kid, not the weirdo with the box of toys he gets to play with while everyone else sits and learns.  In fact, he has things ten times cooler than the spinner that people all of a sudden want to borrow and tinker with.

Definitely. I can get into pretty much any genre of music because I want to find new things I enjoy. Liking something less because you feel it's beneath you makes you a douche, not a discerning listener.
I will never forgive them for replacing RDJ with a talking banana
Yeah this argument is stupid. So many great and original movies come out but all people focus and pay for is the comic book stuff then turn around and complain about lack of originality. It's not hard to look at what's out and do a little research instead of blindly and ignorantly saying a medium (that might as well be at the HEIGHT of its artistic variety) has lost all of its attributes and quality. Just recently Get Out was a big hit.
Are you pronouncing it 'do' or 'doe' in that sentence? I'm not sure there's a right answer.

Piece of shit here, can confirm. Always disappointed my kids don't live up to the idea in my head of how good I could have been if I didn't suck so hard. Maybe if I just yell some more they'll get it. 
Jesus Christ that's brutal. 
Can confirm, am Scottish and already shedding my old skin. I'll be totally white again by morning ready to start it all over again baby!

You're on! 
I've seen two types return from deployment: You get the one guy that talks about everything and goes in to great detail about his deployment and you immediately know he didn't see shit, do shit, or accomplish shit; he just sat in the green zone pushing papers. Then you get the guy that is withdrawn, refuses to talk about his deployment and is genuinely trying to move on. You immediately KNOW he's seen some shit and did some shit while over there. 
I save that shit for when I listen to Chuck Berry.
I climbed to silver/low gold from bronze and down there everyone expects you to suck. In silver/gold most people are decent but lack consistency with trickier moves. I can be great all game and then fuck up one aerial interception that leads to conceding a goal. 50% of the time I will get shit from a teammate if this happens; and its almost always from a ball-chaser.

Kinda made sense for walts character to not swear as often though. Characters like pinkman shoulda been FAR FAR more vulgar.
wait what's he got? 10x cooler than a spinner you say?
You're missing the point. People are mad that kids are playing with anything the adult is unfamiliar with. Down with fidget spinners!! Make Cup and Ball Great again!
That really depends on what the assignment was. 
are you ok?I'M NOOOOOOOT OOOOOOOOKAY!
I'm not religious at all, but that quote pretty much sums up what I think about it. 
I think there are two camps. The ones who are just being playful about a difference of minor opinion, and the ones who get legit emotional about what strangers eat.I think part of the problem is that some people don't realize the first group is playing, because they behave identically to the second group.TLDR: Poe's Law.
Wait a minute... I can't remember being born. Does that mean it may have never happened?
I thought I was in /r/hockey for a second.
Oh man if they replaced the "it's in the game" with bryz that would be hysterical
I asked about that silly dichotomy (Boobs bad, blood good) when I was a kid. I was told I'd understand when I was older. I'm 36 now. Still don't understand.
But in the year -40,000 it was here, and you could walk to it.
True life pro tip right there.
One doesn't mutually exclude the other. Edit : get her father to mentor you and scare the young girl at the same time. 2 Robins with 1 costume. 
You sit closer to the screen at home! Way better than the humongous curved screens that make you sick because you're too close and staring straight. Don't even get me started on wearing 3D glasses over my real prescription glasses. 
I just saved the country. Give me a Coors.
Would've 'accidentally' stuck my foot out in the isle a bit.  Oops, sorry kid, maybe YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RUNNING AROUND LIKE A LITTLE FUCKING SHIT.And fuck your parents, too.  Assholes.
I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Yeah, if he's willing to say that in public, imagine what he says to that kid at home. Actually... don't do that, it's pretty sad.
Yeah. He's made a very good living out of running the league (and still coaching full time in it). Quality dude.
It's not volume-based, you can be as loud as you want (I mean, within reason). It's all tone/content. Disappointed "You can do better" might get a look but nobody would say anything. Meanwhile, "You got this, Jimmy, come on!" is totally fine. And the coaches are all employees of the league, no parent volunteers, which helps as both a distancing device socially and for training. 
Guy with no kids here. I sell participation trophies because the parents can't handle their kid not having one.
My friends would talk about their down time and stuff like that but nothing else, just about how they got a really great tan, played games, hit the gym and stuff like that.Not once would they say anything about anything else, they just have a look in their eyes that is kind of distant.
My favorite was when somebody asked the government how young people should afford houses and the answer was literally "get Mum and Dad to buy it".No, wait, my favorite has got to be Joe Hockey saying that it didn't matter if they raised the fuel tax because poor people don't have cars anyway.It's both very sad and very funny how severely out of touch the government is with its citizens.
And depending on where they're from they may have nothing in common other than that range
What a cromulent thing to say. 
You want some elk meat? I marinate it in MCT oil and tenderize it with my kettlebells.Never change, Joe

It's an interesting phenomenon - a group of clever people pretending to be idiots can inadvertently attract idiots who think they're in good company.
Some more scientific research over the years showed that 'sometimes' is the key word in the aforementioned scientific research.
I long for the day when man is not judged by the color of his skin but by the color of his dick. Sorry ladies.
And some people walked to it.
The hawk doesn't get annoyed being taped to the window?
Give the kid a fucking t-shirt or something. "I was there" is more valuable than "I worked hard and 'won' this trophy that says 'Participant.'"
I'm sorry, we don't have Coors. Is Miller Ultra okay? 
Maybe if they strapped you backwards to the top, all that hot air would do some good.
Am a parent, totally would have done that too.  
Damn. I want to be that guy. No kids yet, but I lived at the soccer complex as a youth. If I could make a decent career out of running a league/coaching I'd quit my job tomorrow. 
> You got this, Jimmy, come on!I thought this is what people did already. That's how most parents were when I played little league.Then again, I played in the crappy leagues and nobody thought they were going to play for the pros
Participation trophy here. You are superb just for even trying!
After a brief moment of 0_0
If you are in the unit with them, and you are training, you hear some shit. You hear those downtime stories, but you also hear stories about the scenarios that you are training for. Part of me wishes I would have deployed so that I feel like I helped, and part of me is extremely thankful that I completed my six years without seeing those things.
Haha, that reminds me of back during the 2012 election here in the States and Romney said that kids who have an idea should borrow $20,000 from their parents to start a business.  Since you know, most college age people have parents with $20k just sitting around.  I think Romney meant well, he is just clueless about the average American.
Cut me off a slab of that sweaty cake...mmm, delicious 
Yeah, embiggen your vocabulary with any word you like.
I got some in the back you can take with you - everytime 
I loooooove my fidget cube. It's fantastic. I just keep it in my left hand while I'm working and only set it down when I need to type something. Just constantly fidgeting with it and it keeps me from feeling restless and distracted. Tried a spinner and didn't really get how it was supposed to help me other than be my primary focus. I also have these mesh chinese finger trap type things that are sealed at the end and have a marble in it. I just move the marble back and forth by manipulating the mesh. That one is great too. 
Ha! Back in my day, we had a stick. A STICK!
Thanks mate
Even later scientific research show that 'maybe' was a key word in the aforementioned comment.
Someone get ahold of Two Tone Malone.
And then it got warmer and the ice melted and there were lots of *trees*
Just put the hawk in your daughters room
He screams, a cold sweat runs down his back as the flavorless pisswater makes its way down his throat...!He wakes up in his bed made of Coors cans. Oh thank god, it was just one of those double-layered "It was just a dream!" twists.
"What the fuck was that Jimmy!? I'm gonna beat you when we get home until you understand how to catch a ball you fuckin narc!"Is more along the lines of today's parents.
Dusty shelf here. Looking forward to getting cleaned off. 
Is loving Maymays legal yet?
"You're on!"*oh... shit...*"The weather today..."
True that. Only time I heard anything was in boot camp. From my chief. Given my position, I'll never see the things he saw, but he drove the point home. This isnt about the down time or the fun you have or the people you meet. People are out there fighting and dying doing things I probably never could. I'm thankful my position keeps me away from it all, but also envious of his experiences because I want to feel like I'm doing more. Even so, my job is to support and provide a necessity to the guys out there. I'm content with that.
If you were rich, you had a hoop to go with your stick.
_because its *warmer*_

Narc? What a strange insult to say to your own child.
Pledge can here. Orders are skyrocketing. Can't wait to make that shelf slick as shit.
We need more of your attitude in the armed forces. It is a collective job, and a lot of meatheads don't realize how vital people like you are. I am logistics myself, though I have one of the more dangerous logistics jobs (transportation) right now. I have seen videos of first hand accounts from my buddies, so I am extremely thankful I didn't have to witness these things.
10 x 1 = 10 Checks out.
Oh, look at Mr. Fancypants over here with a hoop. 
Dust here. Nervous about getting pledged. 
I'm an IT, so I keep them communicating with remote stations. Nothing glamorous or intensely difficult or anything like that. But it is an absolute necessity, and somebody has to do it. I appreciate your outlook on it being a 'collective job'. In all fairness, I'm in about the most dangerous place I could possibly be right now without going to work with Spec Ops.
Dust cloth here; don't be nervous bby, I'm statically charged.
He probably meant for you to *stop cooking altogether*
> Don't approach recipes like they're magic spells in the Harry Potter universe.NOTE: this advice does not apply to baking. Cooking is art; baking is chemistry.
Damn. 49 yrs. The rolling motion. I forgot about the rolling motion. Welp. I probably have 20 yrs left before I'm spoon fed so thanks. 
my mom will only cook with max heat because its faster, but it always ended up tasting better than my dad's careful heat management. then i found out that chinese food is to be made on high heat always basically :/
I learned this while coming up with a perfect spaghetti sauce - originally I wanted to add every ingredient under the sun because I thought it'd give it more of a complex flavor, then I didn't have 2 or 3 of the 10 ingredients I typically used one day but went ahead and made it anyways and the sauce tasted almost a bit more savory. This is great advice for beginning chefs who are experimenting with their recipes! 
>not my best tip How dare you keep your best tip from us... 
Man...every time I want to brown something, and my dad is around, he'll put a lid on the pan because all the 'flavor is being let out', apparently. Sometimes I have to be stern and say I'm following a recipe, but how can I explain this to him? All the meat my parents cook seems to be half-boiled in its own juices from putting lids on every fucking pan...
* Does not apply if it's tomato based, add sugar instead. 
Rather, don't cook naked if you're going to puss out.
Or worse, an omelette pasta instead of carbonara.
Not just kitchen knives.
Or if something comes out a bit sloppier that you expected, you have created a nice wholesome "Rustic" dish.
This is exactly what I do whenever I cook. I always end up with just a saucepan and plates/cutlery once we're done eating. On the other hand everyone else I know ends up with every single utensil and piece of crockery used when they're done, which makes it hard to relax after an enjoyable meal. It's so easy to keep on top of; that part where you leave to simmer for x minutes- wash up while you wait. Bring to boil- wash up while you wait. Cook until softened/browned- wash up while you wait, etcetera etcetera.  
I thought that meant that everything is supposed to be keep in its rightful place.  So you can find it when you need it.
Cut everything before you even touch a cooker. Mise en Place. 
This but also with tops of certain veggies. I've used carrot greens, radish greens, and celery leaves sauteed with butter and salt. They also taste good thrown into salads.Just do a quick google check to see if it's edible beforehand.
People should eat "filling" veggies instead of going for salads if they want to feel full but lower the calories. Broccoli is a great filling veggie, as are squashes and bok choy. There is also great produce to be found at asian markets for greater variety, like enoki mushroom, elephant stalk, and water cress.
NEVER ENOUGH GARLIC
Jesus, i can feel your arms flailing as you speak. 
When you get good enough, you can just look briefly at the recipe and already see why the person that wrote it doesnt have tastebuds.
Following up: Don't experiment if you don't have an alternative meal planned.Especially if you're already hungry. That's a recipe for disaster.
As a rule of thumb, the more you paid for something, the less you should season it. Some yuppie farm-to-table chicken? Salt, pepper, olive oil, maybe a tiny bit of some green herb, oregano, thyme, or my personal favorite majoran. 2 bucks a pound frozen chicken breasts? Hell fucking yes paprika is amazing. 
If there's anything I've learned from the Food Network, it's that I shouldn't be afraid of salt.
Ooh, now that is useful. I'm always pedantic about having clean hands so this will probably help
Have you ever tried to cut a large sweet potato by only letting the blade do the work? 
Can confirm.  Winged a baked potato recipe.  Ended up with a functional, yet batteryless, clock.
Weighing scales are for baking, measuring spoons are a dark art
Seriously. His technique-based teaching style transformed my cooking ability. I was always fairly competent in the kitchen, but I can't think of anyone who has improved my cooking more than him.
No worries. We use tubes these days. 
Chinese food is 25 minutes prep +3 minutes of applying high heat.
Bought lovely new pans. SO (who is major kitchen hazard) used for midnight snack, burnt then scraped clean with a knife. Get a mad facial twitch just thinking about it. 
When I do a roast chicken I always roast some garlic along with the potatoes or whatever delicious veg I am having. And then smush it onto whatever I happen to be eating. Love dat garlic.
Stomach ache, huh? Did she try eating garlic? I heard it can have some medicinal properties.
Son of a bitch, I thought I could make it one week without buying some new high-falutin' foodie crap. Never heard of black garlic before, going to give it a try of course.
You'll get the best tip if you want.
I didn't even know sweetened cocoa powder exists.
It's a dry barrier that will discourage adhesion of the baked good, allowing it to rise as it bakes. Butter is fine if rising isn't a concern, but fats are "sticky" and can actually hold flour-based things down. It's the same reason you would flour a surface when you're rolling out or kneading dough. 
My mother does this with "fried" chicken. Just a little more oil than it takes to cover the bottom of the pan, and covers it the whole time. She can never figure out why it doesn't come out crispy like the fried chicken she has at restaurants, despite me constantly telling her she's making steamed chicken, not fried chicken
Julia Child said: don't crowd the pan and make sure you've patted the meat dry first.
I dunno, a tiny splash of red wine vinegar is my secret ingredient in chili. No added sugar, just meat, beans, crushed tomatoes, pepper, onion, and spices.
Apple cider or apple cider vinegar?
For ladies being naked IS kind of a puss out.  
Don't cook bacon with oil?
Good advice. Ground turkey needs all the help it can get.
Baking is harder, but some of the best ways to get consistent cakes (or other baked goods) is to:          1.) Get a scale and use recipes that give measurements in grams/ounces 2.) taste the batter! Raw batter will not kill you and in general if the batter tastes good the cake will taste good 3.) learn what a well cooked moist cake feels like. It should be lightly springy, but firm, when you gently pat the middle. After a few times you'll be able to tell with no problem. 
Nice try Gary, we know you're still living on insanity you crazy bastard! 
Take a small amount and toss is in a hot pan to cook it through.
I remember seeing a Jamie Oliver recipe with a typo so it said something like 30 teaspoons of salt instead of the required 3. All the comments were complaining it was way too salty. Imagine having that much faith in Jamie Oliver.
Nice split second decision there 
I'm the other way arround. I drop things and have caught them before I register anything more than "Catch the thingy!"If I can't get it with my hands, I cradle it with my foot for a softer landing.This will someday be... not a good thing. 
An inch?  Wow.  Is your floor made of balsa wood? 
My former head chef always said:If you mess up a main dish, call it "Rustic"If you mess up a dessert, call it "Artisanal"

Got my dad a good quality kitchen knife for Christmas. Just found out that he's hidden it away in a top cupboard because it's sharp.

Professional sharpening is cheaper than people think, and a good pro will tell you when it's time to replace. Also: Learn the difference between sharpening and honing, hone regularly and sharpen as needed. 
The problem a lot of beginner chefs have is that we feel the need to watch the pot on the stove instead of walking away and letting it cook on its own. 
Buddy, I think you're doing it wrong.You're not supposed to be in the viking. He just helps you out. 
Which really is just the French's tactful way of saying "get your shit together before you start."
Be careful with this. Some ingredients taste better when chopped fresh. Onions, for example, will be noticeable more flavorful if diced just before using them vs. if they were diced a day or so ago.
My tip: when you see a recipe that calls for X cloves of garlic, just cross out cloves and write in bulbs. 
It.is.in.everything.If you ever want one of your meals to taste more like a restaurant just add butter and salt
All these gif recipes show them just dumping ramekins full of pre-chopped and pre-measured ingredients into their places, is that the way to go? Should I invest in some more ramekins/similar?
Tell me at the very end to check if its safe. you've got your priorities all wrong!Now I have to go to the er because I made a rhubarb leaf salad.
I mean, I get tat you mean 1 plate of "good food" can be more satisfying overall than 2 plates of "bad food", but the fact is 2x the food volume will make you feel 2x as full. For most people on diets, the constant hunger is the #1 reason they fail.If portion control while eating cakes was easy, nobody would get fat in the first place. Also, if the food tastes great, it's harder to not overeat than it would be if it was so-so
My point is that baking formulas were made for a specific ratio of sugar-fat-flour-moisture and if you fuck with the formula it can make the final product inedible.
Saint Julia is right.  Especially because, much of the time, you are reducing the wine for a sauce.  Reducing already fortified wine is quicker for the same flavor punch.
That's...actually a great idea. Only downside to that is you don't have most of a bottle of wine that you "have" to drink now. 
Does this happen? As there people who..... Don't finish their wine?
Yeah I can imagine how moscato infused marinara would be terrible 
i can and do eat sauteed garlic. so good. never enough. 
THANK YOUMy family acts like I'm crazy when I actually toss it in the sauce with a little butter.  Dumping sauce on some dry ass pasta might be what they do at the Olive Garden, but it's not how we roll in my house.
>times her pasta based on what the box saysNot really a bad idea as long as you subtract a minute and actually test it before you drain it. 
You're absolutely right, but this takes a lot of experience. My husband was a chef for 20 years. When he reads a recipe, I know he's goimg to change it because his eyes drift off to a thousand yard stare, his mouth starts making weird half-chewing, half-lip-smacking movements, his hands start flexing as though he were pinching imaginary seasonings, and he mutters to himself.  It looks like the summoning ritual of a culinary demon.
Came to say this, was excited to see it already here. Kenji at serious eats has a great read through on it if you want the science behind it
Instructions unclear, try to eat clock.  No is potato.Such is life.

Never thought I'd see the term wok hei on reddit. It's true though, wok hei is everything
My mom did this to all our nice pans, so now she's pissed that my dad and I don't want her using the NEW nice pans... (I spent $80 on a set of nice cake pans and she thought using a steak knife to loosen a cake I was letting cool was a good idea, and ruined the coating on, and she used steal wool to clean a non-stick frying pan)
I put slices of garlic under the skin of the chicken so it roasts there and flavors the meat
Well, hello there... ;)
It's called hot chocolate powder 
Oh my god! Is this why homemade cakes tend to have a huge rise in the middle, but are almost flat towards the edges? 
I can see that being infuriating.  The worst part is if you ever tried to show her how to properly fry something, she'd probably chew you out for wasting too much oil.
Water! The secret ingredient was water! Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
Personally I need some sugar in there to balance it out. Either brown sugar or sweeter ingredients like carrots. That said, I live in a country where rich, sweet, balanced tomatoes are harder to come by.
A cheesecake without sugar would be horrible. Have her try tomato sauce that's too acidic and ask her if it needs anything. When she can't figure it out, sprinkle some sugar on and have her taste it. 
They both can, but he most likely meant cider vinegar. 
Don't cook with oil while bacon.
Taco seasoning. Some of the best homemade tacos I've had were with ground turkey cooked with taco seasoning.
>It should be lightly springy, but firm, when you gently pat the middle. TIL - I am cake.
Not Gary; Gareth. 
I've made meatballs 1000 times and have never thought of this. I too struggled how to test my meatballs and resorted to tasting it raw. Great idea
My friend had a Jaime Oliver cookbook I borrowed once and it had a recipe for salt crusted fish that I wanted to try, because apparently you don't actually eat the salt (it was a while fish, the salt was on the skin) but my mom said no since she's very anti-salt.
Have you ever roast garlic, in the skins? Probably my favourite part of a roast meal...

Artisanal is what happens when you leave the flour from the couche on the bread when you bake it. 
This happened with my step mom because she cut herself really badly while cutting potatoes. She doesn't practice safe cutting habits.
My grandfather was a butcher. Always said " no one ever got cut by a sharp knife" so true... well... in the kitchen anyway. Every house should have a decent set of sharp knives. 
I have two chef's knives, actually. One for me and one for anyone else in my kitchen.

That guy strolls down my street now and then, calling for people to bring out their knives and scissors.   I live in a traditional meets modern area. It's not rare to see a road rage incident where a Mercedes and donkey cart full of cabbages are both trying to pass each other on a one-way street.
Ohhhhh!!  You just explained so much to me!!   I never understood why my roommates did that, didn't realize it was born of anxiety about leaving food unattended
Aha this is genius :D.
r/VikingsGoneWild Don't you tell me who to be inside. 
As a kid my parents told me that raw onion was poisonous because otherwise I would eat it all while they were cooking or just right from the fridge. They also told me this about smoked bacon slices. Genius bastard. 
First time cooking (trying) to impress my future wife, I literally did not know the difference between cloves and bulbs. I was desperately mincing two entire bulbs when she fortunately walked in and disabused me of my mistaken belief. She's been the smart one in the relationship ever since!
Honestly, I just use tupperware/butter containers/cool whip containers when I mise en place. If I don't have any, I use sandwich baggies.
Maybe also don't eat the tomato leaves.
I met her at a dinner party in the mid90s.Very nice woman.She helped herself to a full, unashamed grab of every guys ass as she took a picture with them.Literally a handful, not just placing it there.She also told a story about smuggling meat from overseas claiming it has been smoked when it hadn't.Julia Child gave 0 fucks.
I've been told there are people our there who aren't alcoholics, yet to meet one though 
With cooking, exact amounts aren't that important. I've cooked enough that I can generally eyeball things to within +/- 10%, so unless I'm doing something really finicky, I don't usually bother. Baking, on the other hand, relies on chemistry. Exact amounts (of some ingredients) are important there!
When I was broke, my go-to meal was pasta coated in buttery garlic and steamed broccoli. I never got tired of that meal. 
Oh my god this is my mother. This drives me mad, and she does it constantly. 
I think that has more to do with most recipes being cut for time. I mean, I'm no professional, but I take my cooking pretty seriously, and when I get home at the end of the day I want to be able to make a meal in 20-30 minutes. Ain't no one got time for 15-20 minutes of sauteing onions when you're starving. On the weekends though, when I have time, you bet your ass I'm sauteing those onions for as long as I can.
At least dinner was on time.
And never, ever be able to replicate it!
"Deconstruction" is (an) Unforgivable
Depends where the tube goes
Yeah, I do the accuser grip with my knives.  It's really not as unsafe as you might think.  'But what if any part of the knife of your hand slips?'  Well....it won't.  In my....ten plus years of cooking I've cut myself maybe ten times on knives.Most of the injuries I've gotten have been from something that you wouldn't expect.  Like the jagged metal part from foil boxes....
Yeah! What is it, anyway? I've tried googling it, but I can't find any chemical explanation. It tastes glorious.
Oh man this made me grimace in pain for you.
Ceramic pans are great until someone does this.  Still don't know if my mom or boyfriend fucked the pan up. 
But even if it was sweet, you'd probably be coughing because it's powdery.
Sometimes, but not exclusively. Another reason is that the outside of cakes in tins will cook much faster - that is, they'll rise, but set before rising as much (the middle cooks slower, so is able to keep rising longer). To help this issue, you can cook in a bain-marie (water bath) which provides better balance over the temperature, or I have these oven-safe straps that I soak and then wrap around the tin, which provides _some_ balance.
Do this with ground meat too. Cook it longer, past the gray color. Brings out the beef flavor instead of gray, boiled, flavorless meat texture. 
A true iron chef.
You said you wanted the flavors to be more alive. 
They said they add onion though, the sweetness from the onion is probably enough.
Good idea. Another thing would be to just make the cheesecake without sugar like the mother wants and have her taste it. Then make another with sugar and have her taste THAT!
That always bugs me, because applesauce and honey are still basically sugar.
No, I meant actual drinkable apple cider.
Okay, that makes more sense.  
Yup, so much healthier too. 
>anti-saltYou poor thing
Yeah it's amazing! It kind of turns to mush and you can squeeze it right out of the clove and spread it on bread. The taste gets much more mellow too. Delicious.
If it's all triggers then there's no bullets.  Catch away. 
Whoa whoa whoa. No one said that.
Shit, my cat would have swiped the knife off the counter toward my feet 
And does all her kitchen cutting overhead
Well, the last time I handled a sharp knife I made a nasty gash in my thumb on the first try... happened at work (yeah, it wasn't the first time) so I've now been banned from sharp objects. Happens all the time.
what the hell is a restaurant-grade mandolin, and who the hell needs restaurant-grade when playing their mandolin, be it for themselves or an audience?
Haha. I have three, one smallish one I use all the time, one larger one in case there is watermelon, and a huge one whose name is getouttamykitchen.
Everybody knows Hatori Hanzo now. He's become a sort of celebrity sword-maker. Totally commercial - complete sell-out. I only use swords from Korehira Yoshimoto - you've probably never heard of him.
Where is this? I've never heard of a traveling knife sharpener, living in CA.
best horror movie ever - you throw out grandma's knives causing her to come back haunting you, trapping you in your apartment insisting she won't let you leave until you're fed because you look like you're wasting away.
I don't trust food not to go to complete shit if not watched. I know what's needed to make the food, but me and my stove have a faulty relationship. One wrong move and shits burned, or cooked on outside and raw inside, I may suck.
I would like to take this time to outsource to the community;Has anyone had the new Cinnamon Frosted Flakes? How are they? Thank you for taking one for the team.

Broke? I'm an adult with a full time job and a family and I still cook that at least once a month. Same with ramen noodles. Throw some veggies, the left over chicken from last night and an egg and you've got a $7 takeout from a noddle shop for $0.92. 
If I cook while she isn't there, my food is perfect. If she's watching me cook, I use way too much salt, she doesn't like cumin, you won't be able to taste anything over that much garlic, and I'm just going to burn everything cooking it that high. When it's done it's missing something. 
I saw a review of a recipe floating around. "I saw your 1/4 cup of sugar but decided to add 1/3 cause my husband doesn't like things too sweet".Why can't people math?
That's neat. 
It's only science if you write it down.

It translates as "breath of the wok". It's a bunch of aromatic stuff produced in the seasoning process as oil is seared into the metal.
I bought a $60 frying pan. Real nice one that I loved. Room-mate boiled water in it and forgot about it. Came back out and the non stick coating was ruined and the pan never worked properly again. I was pissed.
This is when you go out and get an nice heavy cast iron skillet and beat them to death with it.
You use a bain-marie for regular cakes too?  I know you would use one for cheesecakes and custards but I've never heard of using it for a regular cake.
He's 30% iron. 
And now you're sobbing in the corner uncontrollably. 
You mean... make another with sugar and don't let her have any.  Let her wallow in her self-made sugar straight jacket while you are immersed in the wonderment of decadent cheesecake and all of its glory.

Life to her is all about basketball training.
She does the whole granny cutting style where she peels and cubes potatoes against her thumb and because she uses a dull/practically 400 year old knife to do it she'd never cut herself before.
Lmao whoops. Not even gonna edit that. I enjoyed it too much. 
The watermelon knife is key. I keep a sharpened machete for those, pineapples, large cuts of meat, etc.
Yoshimoto's knifes are overated and for ignorant hipsters, i only use Kateshi Samadi ones, they background check you and don't let peasants buy them.   
I live in Toronto. Every 2nd week, in the summer, this guy drives slowly around the neighbourhood in his knife-sharpening truck, ringing a bell like he's the ice cream guy. Not only is he NOT the ice cream guy, he won't stop for anyone! You chase him down the street holding your knives and he won't stop to do his job. I think it's a mob front. 
My grandma always tries to feed me while I'm eating.She'll literally shove a plate between my face and the one I'm currently eating from. "Would you like some gingerbread?" Yeah, I probably would, but how'bout you let me finish the stew you just gave me first? You know what? Screw it, just put it next to the smoked fish.Grandmother's cooking... resistance is impolite.
Oh boy, here I go killing again.
Turn down the heat. Don't go over a bit higher than medium unless you're boiling water or searing steaks.  Gives you more time and forgiveness and stops the burnt outside cooked inside deal.
Cinnamon frosted flakes are fantastic

Mine just can't follow the fucking recipe to save her life. She doesn't get that different ingredients yield different results, particularly with baking which is more an exacting science than just cooking. It's completely maddening. She subs various oils in for what it says, she thinks wheat flour will do the same as all purpose, etc. NO. IT WONT. Then she gets mad because "that recipe is shit". No, ma, it's you.
Or the under side of the meat slicer. You know, the part that's the farthest away from the goddamn blade.
I would assume it encourages wrist extension (lifting up) to compress the median nerve, which is the culprit in carpal tunnel syndrome. 
so like the same concept of why grandma's cornbread in the 30 yr-old never-soap-washed cast iron is way better than mine in the 8" round tin?

Yes, plus a bit of smoke flavor from the high heat.
No you leave it on to season the pan.

He really did miss that obvious softball.
That reminds me of the time my mother in law, while visiting us, used an entire 2 liter can of Spanish extra virgin olive oil to deep fry a batch of chicken wings - this with a bottle of canola sitting right next to it in the pantry.

My grandma's coffee maker broke once. It was at least 30 years old. She was upset. Went down to the basement and came back up with the SAME coffee maker. Turns out it had gone on sale once in the past and she knew she would need a new one some day so she bought it to be prepared for the day that happened. Still being upset, she fiddled around with the old one and got it working again.  Pretty sure she still has the "reserve" one in the basement.
Leslieville. He's unbelievable. Unless you're already out with tool and cash, he's not stopping. 
*Whoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoopwhoop*
My grandmother has backups of every countertop appliance. But the biggest grandmother thing she does is keep the calendar at the end of the year after filling it out with when she got gas/changed oil for her car, filled oil tanks (heat), and random weather facts. She could probably write a god damn almanac. 
Everyone agrees because they define "critical thinker" as "someone whose views align with mine".
Same. My initial reaction was that it sounds too much like #feelthebernThen I realized it's much more of an issue that a campaign pushing for education uses a hashtag with completely nonexistent grammar.It might as well be "#do a smart"
yeah this is bullshit. shit makes it to /r/all just because of the potical subliminal messages
Personally my math and physics classes in high school required a lot creativity and abstract thinking. I mean if you look at the average level of mathematics students are learning today compared to 50 years ago I'm sure you'd find an increasing level of abstraction.
Liquid Crystal Display?
Who upvotes these pseudo anarcho bullshit rants? The most educated are not critical thinkers? What? 
That's a very loose interpretation of a system that encompasses many countries with millions of people working in them. What business men? The curriculum in my province is made my educational professionals who don't benefit at all from stupid children.  In fact having met most of them they would be appalled by that idea. Many teachers try their hardest to make sure kids can think for themselves but you can't keep everyone at the same level in a bulk system. 
I'm being serious here: the internet was a mistake.It should be limited to libraries and universities (for most people)
We definitely need more open minds. Philosophy can teach the intolerant that overwhelming existential dread binds all of us together. We all suffer from the human condition, regardless of where we come from, we all know we are going to die.
Yeah. I've been teaching college level math for about 7 years. It is pretty common place for my colleagues to go on and on about "teaching critical thinking" and then have their students memorize a procedure so they can get the right answer without actually understanding anything.  This is exactly the opposite of critically thinking - It's sheepishly following instructions. I suspect high school is even worse judging from the level of understanding of a typical new college student.
Ever since socratic method teaching was all about nurturing a critical thinking.You must have a very peculiar interpretation of what "teaching" is.
I don't completely agree with this view.  The bread-and-butter of a liberal arts degree or humanities degree are critical analysis papers.  You learn to formulate a thesis and construct a logical argument that backs up said thesis.  Coming up with a thesis, organizing it into paragraphs, and citing your work = critical thinking.
What real problems? 
So you think that ethics and logic are useless?
Have degree in maths.Yes this is a pervasive issue. My best guess is that it is because they are trying to remember what 7+8 is rather than figure it out.When you can figure it out, you memorise it naturally over time.
Me too. It's not too late, though. When you learn new skills, it rewrites your synaptic connections/pathways, no matter how old you are! Kid brains just do it faster than adults' brains. And most of it is available free online! 
MOST parents manage to teach their kids to not think critically. "Why is the sky blue?" "Who cares". Why does the sun change colors at sunset "I dont know its not important"
Nah. Critical thinking refers to Logical Analysis of arguments and other presented information. Investigation is more than that, and includes things like reaching beyond the logical breakdown of information/arguments, to research root causes, context, related information, examination of sources, etc. Someone else called it journalism, and that is sort of true, in that ideally journalism is a form of investigation. A big part of it, though, is learning to come to understand a system, how the system interacts with other systems, and how parts of the system interact with the whole. 
Absolutely! 
Basically, but also how to receive information without accepting it, being able to research and analyze things as a normal behavior rather than as a special effort, etc. it's about more than just learning. 
Yep. Like checking if "news" is really propaganda. That requires investigation, not just vaguely "being smart". Research shows that high IQ does little to protect you against propaganda, but intellectual inoculation can work for people of high and low IQ, to make propaganda less effective. 
I don't care about typos unless they interfere with understanding, but I do appreciate the catch. Have upvote!
So true. And every time someone faces a critical thought that threatens their view, they come up with some explanation for why it's not actually an issue. The thing is you can always come up with some explanation or find some fact to bat away critical thoughts, but people forget that it's not about finding a plausible explanation but deciding which explanation is most *probable* given the evidence!
Until about age 7, then their friends are actually their greatest influence. 
I think the wealth inequality is more of a symptom than a cause, but I agree there is a feedback loop happening that is amplifying the problem.
You need both, and in both most humans are lacking. I can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time; we can teach empathy and critical thinking at once.
Considering American culture/attitude of "your work defines you," which is synonymous with "your salary defines you,"... that's ... yeah. 
Then how come the people with access to the most resources seem to have the least empathy?
Agreed absolutely with this
All I see are people using the circular argument that "if you had empathy, you'd think we need more empathy".  If you're rational, you realize that certain things are finite, and the ecosystem can only support so many people with a certain standard of living, and that we should curtail the population to that limit, otherwise we are all doomed.    But you don't get that if you go with empathy.
Plus there's the implication that Bernie Sanders represents the height of scientific literacy and rationality. In reality the only reason his campaign wasn't regarded as historically intellectually dishonest and science illiterate is because of Trump.
Something worth saying is worth saying simply. The middle-class lingo of academia is the single biggest problem with academia. 
That is probably true. I wonder if some of that has to do with the modern graphing calculator tho. 
Don't know about you but my teachers' opinions were almost exclusively driven by their local culture. The few who expressed dissenting opinions were shunned. Facts are a little difficult to discern these days. The volume of information we have access to makes things very muddy without huge expenditures of time. 
Lowest Common Denominator, I'm guessing. Which, in philosophy debates, is a strange notion. Philosophers can't even agree that each other exist.
"The most educated are the least likely to think critically. You can't teach critical thinking. Education is orthodoxy for the programmed and groupthink." - HA!  Yea, I definitely wonder who is up-voting this vague and unsupported statement. 
That's a really interesting comment! It was definitely not intentional and honestly we did not notice it until now. I really appreciate your thought and I think you make a really interesting argument! Will have to keep this in mind next time around.
well i am getting downvoted.  i'm guessing its because people think they had a great math teacher but they were taught algorithms...missing the point but whatever.  To clarify, algorithms are fine if the end goal is just to be able to do a procedure.  Its worthless if you want to teach reasoning and critical thinking.Source: i teach high school math
It's a nice thought, but nurturing critical thinking is not really what is going on in reality. The student/teacher relationship is almost always "learn what I tell you to learn" and "answer this simple question that I have not allowed you to frame for yourself." And if the student steps out of line the consequence is failure. I suspect you're the one with the idea of "teaching" that's a little off of what happens in reality. 
And the bread and butter of a STEM degree is nothing but critical analysis in every single capacity.  If you think that you can get through a chemistry or engineering degree without learning critical analysis, you're sorely mistaken. The whole point of the sciences is the abandonment of biases and the adoption of critically analyzing results. Where as in any LA degree, a bigger emphasis is placed on how one "feels" rather than the objective analysis of the whole situation.
Interesting. Sounds like you're prone to believing political boogeymen, then.
I expect nothing less of our great state. /s
One of the problems is that I'm told to investigate stuff, but then the tests I'm given are all data points, so I'm not being evaluated on my investigation abilities, despite my teachers telling me that's the way to do well on the tests.
I teach math. My students ask all the time "how do you remember all of this?" My answer is: I don't. I remember the pieces and rebuild it whenever I need it.
You'd be better if you could. Don't buy into the circle jerk of arithmetic not being important
It's not parents, so to speak, but rather our American culture, as a whole, that shuts down inquisitive thinking and wanting to learn.  There's also the underlying anti-intellectualism in most people and our culture. 
Decomposing the word, it literally means "what most people rationalize" which is a recipe for disaster on the internet.
You don't even need to bring religious dogma into the equation if you have a well tuned propaganda machine steering society.
I spent about six years obsessively researching Wall Street from about 2002 (Enron sparked my interest) until just after the crash (where it just got too real to know all this stuff suddenly).  It really was about understanding the systems and how they interacted...from the NYSE to the ratings bureaus to LIBOR and mark to market vs traditional accounting....I have at least a Masters Degree in Wall Street History now and it was just because...I was curious as to how Enron made my electricity bill go up 400 percent overnight. 
but wait!  we gotta know, are you... or are you not... a Professional Quote-Maker?
Yeah, in America they teach that too. I don't what that dude it talking about with the whole Columbus was good and the Vietnam War. Any class I ever took from middle school through college did not portray Columbus in a positive way.
It isn't perfect, but by God, she's going to end up better than me!
There's no market for critical thought. It makes people more difficult to sell to and more difficult to govern.The benefits to a nation are long-term and nations - including their education systems - are governed by people with short-term incentives.
Here's my quote: "yet we still have a large portion of the population seemingly incapable of critical thinking"I don't see where you're coming from exactly. I feel like if I were assuming what you think I'm assuming, I would have replaced the word "still" with "now." Judging previous' populations capability of critical thinking is beyond me
Until about age ~~7~~ 25, then their friends are actually their greatest influence. FIFY
Thats what we are though. Multi-cultural. This means some cultures dont believe in "social welfare".
Empathy is build on understanding how people feel, it will always be easier to understand how people closer to us (not just geographically but sex, race, class, religion, nation, ...) feel. So it will always be harder to empathize with people further away from the spectrum then where we find ourself.
Good ole Protestant work ethic for ya. 
Subjectivity to a detriment. The whole grain of salt they want us to take these "dead old white guys" with is so big it's eclipsing the actual message. It's critical thinking without allowing anything to be be critical of (except for the hegemony and capitalism blah blah). free speech doesn't apply to speech I disagree with, criticizing ideology doesn't apply to religions that aren't Christianity, etc.
I have a degree in literature, but for the first 2 years I was chasing a biology degree. I understand what you mean. I want to note however that all my science professors were doing their best to incorporate philosophy and art into their science. And all my literature professors would laugh at the dumb noobs who only could support their theses with "well that's just my belief" or "that's just how the work makes me feel." Sometimes, lit and phil professors were more scrupulous about sourcing and objectivity than my science professors. 
You're doing well on the test of life, though. That investigation ability is what will let you succeed in the real world
Mostly it's that they aren't being taught well, either because the system sucks or because the school/teachers suck. More often it's the system. But the students are butthurt, it's just entirely justified butthurt. 
I'm the same or so I thought, but the truth isn't you're too lazy, you just aren't motivated.  When you find something that invokes emotion/feeling inside you you'll never lack the effort.  Reddit is a prime example for me, semi-ironic.  I can't say how many times I've done an hour of googling because I saw a TIL that had me going no way that's true. Or women...
It's how most people will mentally do math from my experience (even the large majority of us who went to public schools pre-common core). It will vary slightly from person to person, but beyond simple addition and multiplication these 'tricks' are what allow most people to do slightly more complicated math in their heads. It's just stressed more nowadays than it used to be where you would figure out these things more on your own than in the classroom setting.Examples: * In my head I did 150+70-2+4 for the addition one. * In my head I did 10*25+25 for the multiplication one.
Memorization is not quite the right word. Yes, of course you must remember the concept -- but you must also integrate it into a larger set of ideas (mathematics as a whole). It is the integration that makes it make sense to you. You can memorize anything -- god knows they try and make you do that. That is rote repetition until you can recite it. However you can easily recite it and not understand it.I know this is only a point of semantics, but it's an important difference. I think I understand what you were trying to say, I just have issues with the word memorization for it.
I think the circle jerk has shifted to arithmetic being the *only* important subject, which is simply untrue.
The "If you're smart, you're a loser" mentality, encountered during middle school and high school, is especially detrimental to critical thinking.
Of course I am! I am the ultimate culmination of the modern proliferation of quotable commentation!
Yeah the normal history classes at my school just went over material, there was little to no incentive on synthesis, discussion, critical thinking and deeper meaning of perspectives. Pretty dull actually. But it really depends on the teacher as well, because I had regular World History and my teacher in there was a very good teacher.
It depends a lot on the area you are living in. I live in a relatively liberal area and Columbus was indeed not taught as good. My cousin from another state was taught a complete different view point on Columbus. 
lol my high school history teacher literally wore the tiny ball hugging gym shorts and was the jr. varsity football coach. all we did was read the book out loud in class. if I didn't lean toward autodidactism already I would have been fucked and know jack shit about history like most people.
You are correct and I misunderstood the point. 
Agreed. Thank you for the rec. :)
Nah. Feel the learn is just lighthearted. It might be a little political, but it really is fine.
I'm out of high school right now. Life is definitely different.
How do you test critical thinking with bubbles? I feel like it's just a larger cat-and-mouse game with memorization.
It's much easier than you'd think, and for most people it's just extrapolation of what you are doing intuitively. 
I did it like pen and paper carrying, but in my head it's just "twelve twelve two = 222". I don't see how this is more burdensome.
Fair point. Perhaps memorisation is not the best word, because it connotes ineffective techniques (rote repetition) for most people. Still, I think it's useful to approach understanding as a memory problem. Memory research certainly has a lot to say about *how* to effectively integrate concepts into larger sets of ideas, and how doing so affects performance.
so what most schools are trying to do is teach ALL kids the ways that "good math" kids used to figure out on their own.but this is debatable as far as effectiveness.  Do those methods work because "good" math students used them or did they work because they were good math students to begin with?  Will it work with less capable students? There isn't any conclusive answers yet.  But it seems to not be any worse so why not try.  That said, some parents flipped out because that's not how they learned.
I was at the zoo the other day and kids were just being ignored by their parents when they were asking their parents questions.  I started leaning over and telling kids the answer after the third one I heard be ignored.  May be because parent doesn't actually know why what an orangutan eats, etc, but just say that. Ignoring your kids is not  ok. 
Me too. I just couldn't convincingly pretend to accept that as an answer, and most of the time I didn't try. Usually, I'd say something like, "but obviously there is a reason, where can I find it if you don't know it?" Which got interpreted by my otherwise fantastic parents as back talk. 
I grew up in a very conservative area of Georgia and I was never taught Columbus was "good."
Damn. I knew it was bad but it just got worse.
Yeah, you have all that information, but it's still really fucking nice to not need to sift through your phone for every little thing you need to know. The tests for your knowledge are so that you don't just have the knowledge near you, but literally instantaneously accessible without needing to think about it. Until technology gets to the point where there's literally chips in our minds that can immediately tell us what we want to know, memory (and the pointless school tests that go along with it) will remain an incredibly valuable commodity.
> Watching a video of the best math teacher isn't going to have the same affect as being in the class with a decent math teacher.But interacting with an AI system with multiple video responses of 10 ideal teaching styles beats both handsdown.
I teach math. I assure you, the methods being taught work because they are good methods, not because the "smart" kids do it that way. I know this because even the "dumb" kids are good at math the way we teach it.
I don't have kids, and I'm not sure if you do.  I'm not saying ignoring your kids is OK or that you shouldn't do everything you can to teach them. Just remember that they are still children.  Small children will often repeat phrases and ask questions that they won't retain the answer to by choice.  A parent has to hear this all day long every day.  It is part of social development.  As they get older you should absolutely do the best you can to make sure they are educated. 
If two people can solve the same problem in the same amount of time, what advantage does memorizing every formula for a single test provide?Should people memorize useful formula?  Yes, so ask the to write the formula, and why it's important, and what it's used for.But requiring people to regurgitate stuff that they know they'll likely never use again is teaching people how to FORGET things, and that those things aren't important.
I worked with kids for years and they are little shits...however, this was at the zoo.  I was stuck in line with these families for a bit and they were being respectful. I think that's what got in my craw so I answered the kids questions.  It's not ok to ignore your kids at the zoo when they're asking respectful questions.  How's that for compromise? 
You were right to do what you did in that scenario.  I didn't mean to address you directly with that.  It was more an observation that it is hard to be a parent and as a person who does not have kids myself I have to keep in mind that most really do the best that they can.
I'm guessing Plato would have kept a record, right? Wasn't he known for that? Just guessing. 
Corrupting the youth
I always wondered about the timeline of these men. Thanks. 
Yeah, well, he didn't know much about nukes.
Uh, the 15th isn't the Ides of February. 
Beyond what we can gather form others who w rote about him.
We don't actually know what he was poisoned with. The sources only say ever "poison". The hemlock thing has only been kinda assumed by people long after he was gone. 
Happy birthday!!!!
apology as in apologism, not as in 'sorry'.
Diogenes of Sinope was called "Socrates gone mad". So what would he be without Socrates?
In the trial Socrates set his counterpunishment (as opposed to death) as being fed free food where the Olympic champions feast then added on although he had just a few silver his friends could pay a fine for him. Pretty sure Socrates was fed up with Athens/Life and was ready to die at this point. He pretty much just didn't need to be a dick for a few hours and he souls his lived.
Plato wouldn't have been aware of future changes in the calendar used in Europe, so it's not as if he could make a note of an adjustment.
Actually, the Ides would only be on the 15th in months that have 31 days.
To elaborate, he was accused of not believing in any god, but believing in demons instead. And by teaching philosophy to the youth, he was spreading those "dangerous beliefs".
He was found guilty by a slim margin, once he insulted them with suggesting his punishment should be 3 meals a day almost all voted for the death penalty. There were those that voted yes is he innocent, but then voted for death because they felt offended. Proving the pointlessness of logic in democracy that after no new argument the people who committed to him being innocent thought he should die. 
Plato lays it out
Always remember, it's a spa! Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. Then Alexander.
Was that their first or last names?
On the other hand, he was kind of an asshole who abandoned his family because he was stubborn. 
I think Diogenes' whole thing was not fitting in as a commentary on society. He was a pupil of one of Socrates' pupils. He challenged and embarrassed Plato in regards to the latter's definition of a human. He also had an interaction with Alexander the Great, but it was basically just him roasting Alexander.
If your abolish ignorance, nobody will want to use them.
Good point. Dogs dumb as rocks, but are angels
That..nlooks like a fun idea.But TMI tho.
And Merlin
#MonkeyDJinbeTheClown2020
Nah that doesn't sound right
I mean sort of. At this point it's more or less archaic, apart from its use in "apologist".
The notions about execution in Athens are fairly settled, and classics as a whole has pretty much accepted the indeterminacy or undecidablity of the Socratic problem. I don't think what I've suggested here is very radical by the standards of the discipline, though I know some philosophers tend to take a different tack. 
Plato called him that, back then the bickering and sophistry could be heard in all halls and corners, this would drive anyone mad. Diogenes was my favorite.
If you think about it, most time measurement celebrations are arbitrary. A year, a lunar month and a day exist, but are actually not related. Meaning is assigned by humans, so it's the thought that counts.Also notice how western christmas is roughly at the time of winter solstice and the date of easter is calculated from first full moon in spring(mixing lunar month and year). It is us giving meaning to those days.
question: why was he sentenced to death? heresy?
Right, but I'm assuming we could work backwards, us being aware of the Greco calendar, and then adjusting in that way. 
Socrates died for this shit!
Philosophers argue malas fide, not like us sophists.
Yeah, a lot of his stuff came from his students who wrote *of* his dialogues but nothing directly from Socrates himself.
Ideology always wins out over knowledge.  I wonder if it's more important to *oppose ideology* than it is *promote education*.  In other words, it would be more effective to tell people when they're not really thinking rather than telling them what to think.  Especially now that every fucking thing is seen as propaganda.  
Yep, and those virtuous people, like those who voted nay on Socrates, are lost to history--permanently dead--and here we are talking about Socrates, as we will centuries from now about MLK.
I think classicists think it's most likely roughly accurate because of its date of authorship and circumstances (someone who's an actual classicist correct me if I'm wrong).
Crito does not explain why Socrates thinks he's guilty, to be clear, only that Socrates thinks he is obligated to obey the state
There were no surnames.  People could be referred to by their name followed by their father's name.  For example, Socrates son of Sophroniscus. Specifically in Athens after the reforms of Cleisthenes, Athens and the surrounding area was subdivided into demes.  People could then also be referred to by their name and deme.  Socrates son of Sophroniscus of the deme Alopeke. 
Simultaneously one of the most important philosophers to have ever lived.
Not trying to be contrary, but as a layman with a limited understanding of history and philosophy I was under the impression that Diogenes' whole shtick was a commentary on all of recorded history and our tenancy to need a ruler be burdened by possessions etc. ?
I disagree on the basis that different opinions will still cause high conflict. 
To people they don't know they aren't very nice.
Nandattebayo!! Oh, wait...
Oh that's right it was Steve. Pope Steve, inventor of the Gregorian Calendar. 
Are the dates usually selected *arbitrarily*... or are they usually just inaccurate?
Socrates died for us, and what he felt like was the truth
I always love the fact I  Xenophon's account he say Socrates proclaims in his campaigning youth he fought against Sparta and personally slew a Spartiaite. Not just a non citizen Spartan soldier like a Periokoi or Helot, a full on Spartiaite. At one point a stone cutter's son at 19 or 20 faught against a Spartan in melee range and killed him,  then fifty years later changed western thought forever. 
So P. Pullman did not invent the Daemon concept in *His Dark Materials* :o
Irrelevant - it was entirely effective. 
we have the best answers, don't we folks?
I'm not a philosophy! You're the philosophy! 
Like Jesus and his disciples.
Hmm, that reminds me of something else.
I believe Xenophon as well 
he absolutely was in his trial he didnt make any case for himself not being guilty and instead decided to mock the prosecutor, then coming up with a joke sentence for himself sfter being found guilty. he wasnt exactly wise in how he acted (also because accounts label him as being gross and unkempt and just an overall fuckin weirdo)
We still have that, ie names like Johnson.
Diogenes doesn't fit into the direct line of teacher/pupil relationships from Socrates to Alexander that Bocaj1000 was mentioning at first. You are very much correct in your interpretation of his philosophy, but that doesn't mean that it's contrary to what I was saying (especially as I was just making a play on words with the first sentence). He held "extreme" views on society and wealth, and  the austere way in which he actually practiced his philosophy (a mix of cynicism, asceticism, and cosmopolitanism) made him an outcast.
Perfect knowledge implies perfect opinions
Especially since we lost like 15 days in the calendar in the 1800s
No, they're the ruling class and only ones allowed to breed...That's what happened, right? Right?
Hemlock was used during Roman Times and referred to as the Greek way.Discovering an LD50 poison tincture  that can be easily ingested isn't exactly easy in the classical world before chemistry. 
Emperor constantine, the first christian emperor celebrated it at that time of year. It was during his reign that christianity became the dominant religion in the roman empire. His choice of december 25th might be a way to integrate christianity and existing traditions, namely saturnalia, which was celebrated at the same time of year, and involved going to temple, a huge feast, and gift giving.
One way to imagine Socrates as a fictional character is to think of him as kind of a meme of Greek society at that time.  When you think of him this way the discrepancies between platos Socrates and Aristophanes Socrates make a lot more sense.  
The best subs delete those long joke chains that clutter the top 2/3 of any given page, for example.
That's always seemed a very weak reasoning to me; that our rights are "given" to us by the will of the group...My rights come from my very existence as a living being, my right to free speech comes from the tongue in my mouth and the air in my lungs
I'm pretty sure he died because he drank the cup of hemlock.
Using the same logic that I approach life with- I have no reason to fear death as nobody has ever proved to me that it's a bad thing, and nobody CAN know that it's a bad thing
Alternative News
Irrelevant - It was ineffective as the sole purpose of Socrates was to question and make other people question. He had an exit (obeying the court order / stopping his studies) yet he didnt chose that one.Here we are thousands of years later, still questioning the integrity of plaintiff and whatever we come across.Socrates won. 
Paul Feyeraband's Three Dialogues on Knowledge is what you're looking for.  A sort of comical modern version of a Plato dialogue. I think one of the framing devices is someone accidentally walking into the senior level epistemology university lecture.  Very fun read and good for undergrads.
Nah, there isn't a 100+ year gap. 
It's getting a little too brave in here
My philosophy text does not call him a fuckin weirdo in the 300 pages about him...
No it doesn't.  I can value individuality or I can value equality.  Depending  on that I will choose different policies that can be opposing each other 
That's a pretty ignorant thing to say.
Wow, eugenics upvoted on /r/philosophy. Don't know what I expected.
This has nothing to do with the claim that we don't know whether or not Socrates was a real, historical figure, which he demonstrably was.
> /r/AskHistoriansIt does more than that, as it has some fairly strict, and easy to follow, rules for both commenters and mods. It works more as a scholarly response to lay questions than simply just answering based on whatever one may think they know.
Only if you're using the word "philosophy" loosely. Insofar as philosophy is a field of study, my comment is correct. If you mean that philosophy is the study of abstract ideas in general, sure... but that's not what this sub is.
Try saying that in North Korea.  You and your children and parents will all be eating leaves in a concentration camp that same evening.
One time I made tea out of needles from some pine trees in my backyard. When I showed my Mom she said those are Hemlock, not pine trees, and I freaked out because I didn't want to go like Socrates. Then after some googling we learned that Hemlock plants and Hemlock trees are two different things.
Apology by Plato
Wasn't he offered exile in place of execution but he turned it down to make a point? One of my college professors told me this but he could have been full of shit
Yeah but more than that Plato and people of his ilk looked down on them because they didn't care about making reasoned, logical arguments but instead focused on semantics and rhetoric to win an argument. They were seen as a kind of philosophical charlatan.
There's no canonical Gospel written 100 years after Jesus's death. 
He actually did though
I would apply it to most well known people of ancient times.
No because perfect knowledge would be awareness of which you should support based on empirical fact.  You think this concept isbsomething entirely different from what it is.  Obviously its not something practically achievable.
I'd venture that with perfect knowledge we could manage our emotions in accordance with fact and still avoid conflict, realizing that was in our best interest.If I've eaten the donut, you might be upset, but the fact is the donut is gone. You could choose to act solely on emotion, and be angry with me for eating it and retaliate, or acknowledge the fact, state your concern (manage emotion) and we can come to a resolution.Your emotion is a fact (for you), as well as the physical impetus for your emotions, so both could conceivably be mediated via perfect knowledge.
Probably a reference to Plato's *Republic*, which does get kind of eugenics-y.
Yes, Socrates was a real, historical figure. But the Socrates that everyone talks about, Aristophanes Socrates, might have not been. Imagine if I wrote about Hitler, but wrote stories about the fact that he was just a lowly art student who didn't do much with his life. Did I write about a real, historical figure? Or not? How much can you change about a person's life before you're not longer just making little tweaks, but writing about a completely different person?
There are many wise laws that supercede your right to do whatever you might like to best survive and reproduce. For example killing your neighbors and taking what you need from them or raping whatever person you feel like reproducing with, just for example.
Similar story - one time when I was in a battle royale my partner picked some berries to eat, but they got stolen and eaten and killed the person who stole them! They turned out to be nightlock (a berry just as poisonous as hemlock).  Lucky that kid stole the berries otherwise my friend would have been toast.  Your story reminded me of that, for some reason.
Well the alternative was to have a Roman soldier reach up his butt and pull his heart out so... yeah, probably willingly.
/u/Ghuliann is actually referencing Crito
Yes thats the case. The thing with exile at Ancient Greece was that, if you get exiled from your own town you will probably wont be accepted at another one or wont have rights even if you were accepted. Let alone being able to teach...Also considering that he was old, I dont think it was a hard choice to do for him.
I just finished replying below, but basically yes, they sold gimmicks and didn't care much about actually teaching reasoning skills.
Indeed, they were seen as "in it for the money" and not for the spreading of knowledge, and as such were viewed lowly by "actual" philosophers of the time.IIRC they were criticized for selling gimmicks of thought (for example, using riddles that the common man might have never heard, in order to appear smart),  rather than teaching actual reasoning and critical thinking skills.
> the majority of the New Testament was written by Paul who wasn't even a discipleWhat?  Only Paul's letters were written by Paul.  And none of the disciples could have written anything since they were very likely illiterate.
>There are many wise laws that supercede your right to do whatever you might like to best survive and reproduce. For example killing your neighbors and taking what you need from them or raping whatever person you feel like reproducing with, just for example. I find it interesting that those laws are passed and enforced by people or groups who have, historically, been successful at killing their neighbors. I've become fond of the saying, "Might doesn't make right, might just determines whose idea of right prevails." 
Hey I remember you! You were on a big TV. Tell me how's your sister been these days?
Or he could've tried to escape when Crito told him to. 
It is discussed at length by Plato. Essentially Socrates felt obligated to the rule of the state as it was that state that enabled and created him in the first place.
According to Plato. You don't see any cynics or Aristotle bitching about Sophists. much later Seneca who would have had access to Sophist writings said they were a better guide to philosophy and ethics than of all the Greeks. of course he did tutor Nero in philosophy and that turned out wonderfully. 
Yeah it's actually illuminating to learn that what we're dealing with in modern times is really nothing new
The concept exists. We are discussing it. It's taught in virtually every philosophy 101 class. As I said it's unattainable. However, because of that striving to truly understand the world around us does not preclude debate, but encourages it. It is when we believe we already have "perfect knowledge" or even worse mistake our feelings for knowledge that debate becomes impossible. Anyways, seeing as we are in /r/philosophy just thought I would point out that from a prominent philosophical point of view that there is a "Form" of perfect knowledge that no human knowledge will ever approach.
Civilization is a process far from completion, deal man. 
My sister is.....ugh. It's been a rough few years. I don't wanna talk about it. 
He kind of is! Once I was starving on the street scavenging for food and all he did is throw some burned bread at me.  He had a whole damn bakery behind him but all I got was the burned bread.
No way, man.  Plato wrote a whole fucking book about this, and if that masterful execution of the Socratic method didn't convince you that staying was the just thing to do than you didn't read the same book I did.
> I think teaching philosophy can cause jumps in maturity and lead children and teens to take more interest in their future.What has lead you to think this?
Check your "recent downloads".
I am a math professor. Can someone tell me what "smarter in math" means?
I really hope the article wasn't written by philosophers who are actually bragging about their logic reasoning skills.
This is partially because of logic in both subjects, isn't it?
Not at all obvious and possibly false.
You saw the truth :)
I think children could be especially receptive to a Socrates. Pretty sure authority figures in education would want to clamp down on that shit in a hurry if the kids started learning too much from him, though.
It sounds like 'don't ever try' propaganda to me.
Negative examples can be helpful too. Or perhaps taking for positive example, the sparknotes for those particularly dense texts. ;)
You should start one. Sign me up!
I think it's funny that they had to give critical thinking merit, by connecting it with math and English. As though any of them need the other two, in order to be a functional life tool...
Check out 3 minute philosophy on youtube. It's a great primer on some of the basic ideas
If by most you mean "a very, very small percentage", then sure. 
It's not about sitting in rows, filling out important forms, to sit in better rows and fill out more important forms-It's about giving children the gift of critically thinking through multiple perspectives, As it can apply in life.- and it definitely can.Do you think Trump would be president if children were introduced to philosophical concepts by age 10, about 50 years back?Not that I'm frothy about it- but it's pretty obvious that people today have no grasp of philosophy.
Really? Back it up with some links. Especially concerning Baseball and Magic improving english writing skills. Expanding your vocab by a few token words doesn't count.
IB survivor here and no, I agree with this. Tok is a pain but having it there as a constant teaches you think think in a way other programs don't. 
Read more books.
Yeah we wouldn't want to get bamboozled
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you're saying that you're willing to ignore the lack of evidence in an article so long as it conforms to your pre-established beliefs. 
I suppose the best way to see the general consensus for a post on a subreddit is to give it a few hours, that way a good chunk of the users will be able to see it, and thus give an idea of what plenty in that community think.Thank you for the compliments and for having restored faith in the subreddit!
Thank you! Admittedly, I only recently have taken an interest in philosophy - by sheer chance, no less, thanks to YouTube - however, I'm extremely glad I did, as this field of study appeals to me greatly. I do agree, it should - at least, on a somewhat more simplified level, as I doubt younger children will understand complicated philosophical concepts - be taught to children of all ages, or at the very least children in the early aspects of grade school.
This is interesting! I also heard Brazil had classes that directly taught philosophy. This makes me pretty jealous of other countries, haha.
Perhaps they should teach it at a younger age then, to spike the interest from young. Even then, while it may not automatically make everyone who takes the class someone who is a great critical thinker, I would wager that it does provide a decent amount of benefit. I just wonder if there is any data regarding this subject.
Thank you! Seeing as how popular my comment got, I'm glad to see so many folk agree with checking sources, no matter to what narrative they may appeal.(I agree, this article works as a story, but isn't the best constructed in terms of providing facts.)
To some extent, I agree. However, by that point, many students likely wouldn't take an interest in it, due to schools killing any drive for learning they may have had. Thus, I feel that education should be reformed in a way that doesn't push test scores and pure memorization, but rather learning and applying skills learned in all of these classes in the real world. Furthermore, philosophy should be added in an extension to this critical thinking being taught, to potentially guide students on how to properly think.
Well, if the information that was discovered is valid, then it provides a valid argument for philosophy being taught in schools. However, since there are potential issues with the project report, it may just turn out to be nothing more than a hopeful wish.
I don't believe this is any different than what you said. I just pointed it out in specifics to avoid individuals potentially taking it as objective fact, when there are errors within the article, and potentially in the report as well.
That's interesting! I've noted other individuals saying that in Brazil and Germany they had philosophy as courses as well, and seeing the differences in the way it's taught between the three is becoming rather interesting. It leaves me wondering which method of them all is the most effective.(For context: The user in Brazil just said they had a regular philosophy class, whilst the user in Germany said they had philosophy and psychology mixed together in high school with their religion/ethics class.)
That is a fair point. Though perhaps they taught genuine philosophical ideas and concepts, but didn't go too in depth given the age levels. I cannot say for myself, as I'm replying to these comments before reading the project report.
I had zero philosophy courses in highschool. Zero in middle school. One in college. All in OR.Most of my rigorous world-interpretive approaches take place through the analogical lens of Oxy-Acetylene welding.
Same, I wasn't able to really see its use until university, but it's been a massive help. Though to be fair it also helped quite a bit with my history and peace and conflict IA's. 
I disagree with this idea. I know people who think philosophy is useless, but that the discipline is useless. Of course they don't think that logical reasoning and methods of inquiry are useless (unsurprisingly, one of the people who holds the view that phil. is useless is studying physics), but that asking questions and thought experiments with very few definite answers is useless.Ironically I think you've made a false dichotomy without any justification, and *you're* the one advocating for philosophy.
> Formal logic is essentially computer science.Formal Logic encompasses much more than what is needed in computer science, and the types of logic useful in computer science are rarely taught in 100 and 200 level philosophy courses. Nor should they be.I'm not trying to be pedantic, but if you're being dismissive of the status quo you should at least understand what you recommend as a replacement.
Well for starters we don't have nationwide standards. I guess there's NCLB and Common Core, but I feel like things vary state to state or even district to district. When most schools are already on a tight budget, I don't know how advocating for added philosophy would go over in a lot of places. 
Thank you! I think the intervention is a great idea and I am interested in the results of a proper study. 
Philosophy is basically the art of thinking clearly and completely. After people develop that skill, they then apply it to their own life. Thinking clearly often means thinking about what you want, what your goals are. Thinking clearly about your goals will lead to the development of an actual plan to achieve your goals. But it takes time to achieve your goals, and thus it becomes more important to take steps to ensure that your life in the future will be able to meet your desires. Therefore, this person has developed an interest in their future. 
In my philosophy class, all the work was subjective. It was all reading and essays, the essays basically asked us to respond to philosophical questions, once you started writing, all your existential childhood dreads that you didn't even know you had come out on the paper. 
How does one even go about teaching an 8 year old about philosophy? I'm geniunely curious.
I felt the same way at first, but now I feel like there's no system at all, no one made our society, it's just how we all evolved to live. There may be corrupt people or corrupt groups, but the society as a whole is just what humans came to be.
No. I think philosophy is the study of what we don't yet understand, religions tend to have concrete belief systems.
A book by Susan Blackmore called Consciousness: An Introduction.In my opinion this is the next best thing to taking a philosophy class. It merges philosophy with neuroscience and connects them to the problems of our modern world. In addition, the works of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and Machiavelli are considered to be the foundation of philosophy. 
yep! you got it
In the end I agree, just the typical IB student complaining hehe 
Any recommendations?
It does not seem like they were saying that to me. Rather, I believe they were trying to say that, in spite of this article being potentially untrue, they still hold their beliefs that philosophy and critical thinking could be valuable to teach in schools.
Maybe it's late and I'm just being pointlessly curmudgeonly and persnickety, but can't those two sentences be applied to literally *any and all* curriculum suggestions in *every possible domain?*> **Statement:** Although the sources for this article are sketchy, I'd like to believe that teaching children mathematics could prove to have tremendous value if done correctly.> **Response:** If done correctly is the key. This seems like it would be highly dependent on teacher skill.As caveats go, it's paraplegic.
Agreed. People should not expect every upvote to include a full read-through of a link wth an investigation of its sources. Upvotes are more like a filter for what is interesting. I *do* expect the comments section to contain a good discussion about the post, including a vetting its sources. I feel like any subreddit ought to be judged by its comments section, and r/philosophy usually does quite well there.
Yeah maybe, I was on Modzilla...good you got it anyway.
Well I do not think so. For example in politics and so on you have still the majority that do not follow so much logic. It is true though that for those few that are interested it is very useful. 
Here here! As someone that just graduated, I agree. They teach us a shit ton of material, but they don't have the applied part down. Sadly, at the high school level, it seems like nearly all the education isn't meant for bettering you/your intelligence, but rather is meant to prepare for college gen ed courses.
In Sweden we have all of these classes. Although ethics goes under the religion course.
You think you're being snarky, but this might make you one of the more qualified philosophers on the planet.Read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" if you want to get some heavy philosophy from a smart tradesman.   
Sorta depends on which small town out there. In LI, depending where you are, can be quite affluent and that will often change the local school district.
This makes me sad. I logically know teaching isn't a respected profession but you don't need to be so blunt about it
So you're saying it's not likely to be a priority in all american schools for the foreseeable future?That's a far cry from "it will never happen." Plenty of schools can offer it as an elective, and it could then build up from there.
As am I. Philosophy has great potential for education, however, I do not believe there is much study as for how it's applied, which is a shame.I suppose either some among us will have to conduct a reliable study, or we'll have to wait for others to come along to do a reputable one.
For the curious what was it that you realized wanted to do?
Or rather how our brains seek some sort of comfort and those structures came from that. Our brain basically craves for security, patterns it can get stuck into. For most that security is mindless entertainment for others it may be their outward potrayal in form of social status or money.    Difficult to maintain motivation for goals when you realize those dynamics. I guess it is philosophy coupled with neurology in my case.
I see. I agree. 
It's not really a coincidence, they are after all comparing two groups. I do agree the strangely worded article; the Statistician(s) who did the studies mentioned should have explained it to the writer of the article.
I'm always skeptical of posts that don't know the difference between there and their.  Correlation <> causation.
I've seen articles on Wikipedia that have, presumably, been updated recently, but provide dead citations.It's likely the links never worked in the first place, or some site renovations occurred, and the original author of the article never bothered to update anything.
Possibly, though I think it's even more so with philosophy. With subjects like biology, math, and physics, the teacher has some influence, but a great deal of the subject involves memorization and routine practice. With philosophy, memorization and practice are much less important, and guidance from the teacher during discussion and analysis is key.
Yeah, the comment sections typically contain the more active and outspoken users, so they're most certainly a more reliable means of getting an idea of what the subreddit is like, rather than basing it purely on the OP.
That's fair, I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree unless evidence comes up for either of our points. But, nonetheless, I'm glad that we can agree that there are some individuals who do find it useful.
It's most definitely incredibly unfortunate. It's primarily just memorizing the information and answering questions based on what you know. It's not truly learning the information, as we did with mathematics and reading, but rather learning to memorize.
Really now? I'm extremely envious now, haha. Isn't Sweden also a very Atheistic country, too?
You recognize that the person who wrote that studied philosophy at an undergraduate and graduate level right? 
I do. It helped my critical thinking skills throughout my life. 
why did you say logically? sorry, i just took a logic class and i hope i didnt already forget what a logical truth is, not tryna be an ass or anything
Agreed, I have seen relatively few (if any besides this?) studies on translating philosophy to the classroom. That said, I am biased as I read mostly psychology literature. 
Well I always had a bit of an interest in programming but i never thought it was something I could actually make a living out of. The class gave me a new fascination for what could become with new technology. We have infinite possibilities we have at our finger tips. What got me was something about the fact that we are so insignificant, yet in the last century or so we've changed more than we have in millions of years. We are the first few generations to truly create our future. So, I took AP Java, aced it and now I'm a cs major.
It depends on how you see it. We have a lot of diversity in terms of religion. A Swede in terms of ethnicity is most likely Atheistic or "christian" although very very secular. On the other hand there are a lot of immigrants that are muslims. So at the end of the day it's more of a question if it's Swedish people in terms of ethnicity or the citizens. But if you mean the ethnically Swedish people, then I would bet that we're either Atheistic or secular to the point of not really minding about our religion, since many of us got christening when we were born.
I didn't.  That's really cool.  I took his assertion he only had one philosophy class at face value.
I'm a math teacher. I was using a local idiom.I know teaching isn't respected based on a lifetime of comments like ops. 'Why would someone teach if they are smart enough to do something else' is how most Americans view teachers.It's why I left teaching. My old coworkers, a lot of them were smart. And they honestly wanted to help make the world better.But it's not a values position culturally
I don't see how else you could mean it. If teaching were a respected profession, you wouldn't think to make such a comment. It would seem perfectly normal for a PhD to teach at a high school, rather than it being below them.
The most I've seen was English classes and, possibly, science classes attempting to *very lightly* integrate critical thinking. They're really only scratching the surface, and they hardly go into detail about why it's important to do such things, which is a real shame.
No, there is useless knowledge. I suppose all knowledge has a *potential* use, but as far as actual use, no. Shitty educational practices based on outdated paradigms shouldn't be defended, they should be smashed.
That answer actually is the exactly reason why. I've found out about the free learner (called Freilerner here in Germany) project. But It is too risky. I am gonna do a job as self-employed drawer, tho. I hate idiotic bosses.
Hold on, you guys know that Bill Gates bought Microsoft OS and then created the company after, right?
I don't want to sound pejorative in any way but you had to take a philosophy class to understand that you could make a living being a programmer?
That is true and is a good solution to the problem, however that doesn't mean one shouldn't be skeptical in spite of it. While a lack of evidence provided doesn't mean there is no evidence for the stance, there is still no evidence provided in the first place.
Absolutely.  All of my math classes are purely computational.  The above wouldn't really apply in a proof-based class.Relatedly, I really do not envy the people taking proof-based math courses.  Proofs scare me.
Historically philosophy was the basis for math, not the other way around.
My chem teacher in high school made it a point to let us know that he could triple his pay at any moment by leaving for the private sector.
I don't really get why you're taking such offense to it.  I don't really have an issue with it, just most doctorates work at a higher level. 
No, he had to take philosophy to understand the potential and wonder of programming. Did you even *read* the comment? Nowhere did OP say anything about how philosophy made him think he would be good at it or that it would make him money.
It does seem a bit plausible though, at least for those that have taken a lot of philosophy. But then maybe we have stockholm syndrome ;) It makes me curious for more studies, particularly of comparisons between achievements of students in countries with philosophy as part of their core curriculum vs. those in countries without. Though it'd be a loose corelation study, it'd at least be something....a start.
> Proofs scare me.Hmm ... that seems to go against the "learning philosophy makes you smarter at math" thing.
I went back to engineering for the reason
Do what will make you happiest. For me it wasn't teaching. But for a lot of my friends it is
>Well I always had a bit of an interest in programming but i never thought it was something I could actually make a living out of. The class gave me a new fascination for what could become with new technology. 
It is indeed very plausible, I do agree. I also agree that the study you suggested would be a very good start to seeing the potential benefits of philosophy. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see for any philosophy-related studies, and hope that in the near future they become a part of most countries' curriculum.
I stand by what I said. That doesn't say "philosophy made me think I was capable in programming", it says "philosophy made me interested in the possibility of what can come of technology". I still don't see thinking he is capable in tech as a *direct* result of the philosophy, but more of a tertiary one.
Hell, it had enough of an impact that I'm certain my views were affected before even knowing who Chomsky was were affected by his work third hand.*editing sentences on phones is hard.
Definitely interested.
Aaron Schwartz was murdered!
 He's definitely one of those names that should make it through the thickets of history and culture, but will he? Depends largely (as things stand today) on some of the very forces he's spent many years railing against.
They're working on it I think, it's gonna take some time though to scan all of his notes and everything and upload them
Check r/socialism. I think there are a few posts about the important stuff regarding your inquiry. 
That's a stretch.  
I think that he's just created a different kind of bullshit. But at least it's thought provoking.
I couldn't disagree more, the man defended the Khmer Rouge.
Outside of organizing and having meetings, I don't think he has much else to say on it aside from pointing to historical examples. 
Will it be understandable for a non student who just wants to know more?
Given the vast scope of deplorable actions undertaken by the US government in the 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond; I find it hard to believe any damning of said government by Chomsky could be considered disproportionate.
I'm glad /u/mundotaku has Noam Chomsky all figured out. Great job!
There are certainly government & media paid shills shitting all over reddit every day trying to push a bias. 
He's one of our age's Renaissance men.
A "formal grammar" is a mathematical way of representing syntax in a language in a heirarchical way (using a tree to represent the different parts of speech). Chomsky found a way to normalize grammars so sentences could be parsed efficiently, so that we can analyze the "tree" to study languages better. (please correct me if I'm wrong, as I learned this through the perspective of CS, not linguistics).
If you have some understanding of computer programming, any intro course to Compilers will teach you a lot about formal grammars. This is less helpful if you're interested in Chomsky's many other Linguistics topics, however.
Which is super unfortunate because Chomsky's "lets hang back and see what the actual damage is" was the correct approach in many other situations. His attitude towards Central America, Asia, The Middle East, and parts of the Soviet block ended up being correct in the broad scheme of things.And then he was wrong about the fucking Khmer Rouge. 
Is it? He is literally the man most responsible for all of modern linguistics, including computer science linguistics. He revolutionized both philosophy and science. Well, perhaps the latter more than the former.He also went toe to toe with Foucault, the most important philosopher of the 20thC (at least post-war).On top of that is what he is perhaps more famous for: his DAMN impressive scholarship on the US empire and Manufacturing Consent.
He didn't. 
Being critical of someone doesn't require you to have equal or greater accomplishments than them.
Although you were down voted this is pretty accurate. I always wonder how many people on here claim to have read his work but are really just people who watched some interviews and believe they have a fundamental understanding of what Chomsky represents. 
Calling Chomsky Anti-American, Anti-Imperialist, biased, or out dated at all fair criticisms of Chomsky.But saying that man hasn't been out on the stages debating with intellectuals is not a fair criticism. He's been doing it for years and he's quite good at it. 
A good portion of it
Its easy to see the international policy of America during the Cold War as bad until you analize the whole thing in a worldwide stage against the Soviet Union. Chomsky's criticism is disproportionate because he often makes it seem like the US was just doing bad things for the sake of it. I read most of "How the world works" and i honestly couldn't get through it. The whole thing is so one sided that its ridiculous. 
Yeah, that must be the reason he supported Hugo Chavez for almost a decade.
When I started reading Chomsky, I found his writing style to be quite dry and a bit cumbersome to read. I would highly suggest "Understanding Power" as a first Chomsky book. It's not actually written by him, but it's a collection of transcripts of him just talking plainly with random audiences, "free-style". It's a very engaging book.
Chomsky would be proud of you.
It sumerizes 200 pages of dry reading into some digestible content. I struggled to read MC due to the sheer volume of examples and arguments that Noam peppers in his book. 
Me too, thanks 
What do you mean? How is he contributing to what he's lambasting?
Trying nothing.  Reddit is a political and business marketing tool as much as a TV commercial.
Why? You think he thinks he's going to die soon?
This is hilariously correct but as far away from explaining in an "I'm 5" way for those not in computer science as it gets
Some things are not meant to be understood by five year olds. 
My grandfather was a linguist at mit way back when and worked with him 
I am unconvinced. I agree there can be merit, but Armenia, Central Africa, and Cambodia all suffered for that attitude. I don't, mind you, have a good answer.
Eh, his influence in linguistics is not very disputed.  Everything else is very disputed.
MLK was essentially rewritten to take out the Communist leanings and the anti-war part leaving the "nice" uplifting anti-racist meme.
It means that he isn't a person that everyone just needs to listen to. He's brilliant within his field but quite flawed outside of it.
Like what?
No but usually it helps to be correct when making a claim. 
When was the last time he got on a platform to debate someone who has ideals different to his own? He wouldn't debate Sam Harris. He wouldn't debate any Chicago economist, he makes claims against society and the global economy as a whole yet doesn't offer any substantial evidence for his claims outside of his own historical critique. He has yet to debate an economist yet most of his work as of late has been to dismiss modern societal economies. Give me a break. 
Understanding Power is a book that everyone should read. He digs pretty deep into America's dirt. I'd go as far as to call it entertaining albeit pretty disheartening.
That's sad. You should google "Israeli Art Students"
It is a mess on mobile.
Yes, but for the most part, that political bias isn't coming directly from the admins or the owners of Reddit. Yes, they've engaged in a small amount of censorship, mostly banning a few subreddits that broke laws, were overtly racist, or engaged in widespread doxxing, and have also tweaked the algorithms to limit the reach of a small number of LOUD subreddits. However, most of the bias is coming from companies who have invested money in "cracking the code" of Reddit. I do think that might change in the future. 
He's almost 90 and in the past decade or so he's visibly gotten old and frail, his voice raspier. I saw a video of him give a speech in December, he had to be helped to the podium. 
Fuck that, anything we understand as a species, or will ever understand, is being understood by a 5 year old that had years of extensive explanation. Unless there's like a super smart 4 and 3/4 yo out there who's about to about to die. Fingers crossed.
Nailed it!
How do you mean? I'm a bit unsure 
His "influence on linguistics" goes far beyond what little, if any, most people associate with ideas about language and grammar and meaning. The modern version of a mechanical explanation for thought is due to Chomsky and Turing. Maybe his influence in cognitive science is only due to this work in linguistics, technically -- but his underlying ideas (some found in Plato, Descartes, Leibniz) are much more profound than those of sentence structure. 
You shouldn't just listen to anyone, you should do your own research. In this situation you could go find out the truth of the Khmer Rouge situation and form your own opinion. If you think he's quite flawed than I'd like to know how, because he does his homework better than anyone else. That's why he's been around as long as he has without being dismissed as a crank. 
I hope its good. I literally just placed the order. Itll be here on the 29th! This is what I love about reddit. Its all in the comments. 
Agreed, fantastic work.  One of his strongest after MC imho. 
Use Reddit is fun, it's incredibly easy plus it has a theme for amoled 
Yeah it's almost time. His wife is gone, soon it'll be him.
'Hang back and see what the damage is'The Armenian genocide and the Rwandan Genocides (and several other central african conflicts) occurred because people didn't want to get involved. Frequently citing 'Hang back because we can't trust the propoganda'
Have you ever read about von Neumann, Feynman, or Shannon? It's interesting that you'd say a linguist is the most important intellectual of the century that saw the advent of nuclear power, computers/the internet, quantum mechanics, and space exploration. All of these things greatly affect your life everyday.
> 5 filtersWhy? Although a nifty paradigm, I'm always disappointed by how he couldn't see how he participates in the manufacturing of consent.  And how liberals always seem to point at the mainstream media doing whatever, yet how is the MM really different than a college campus?  How is feminism and racism not just fit into the propaganda machine?I guess the 5 filters is a nifty theory.  But when you look beyond just these specifics, it seems pretty obvious so many people who hold those filters so dear only do so because their machine sucks.
Reddit.  Where you can't judge a book by it's cover ;) ...  But you do.
happy cake day!
Cunning linguists all over this sub
Don't sound so gleeful
You never go out the way you came in.
> the ones that matterThis seems to be the point of contention.
Part of it. I think we're also getting hung up on what left-wing and right-wing are defined as.I define them mostly economic. The news media defines them mostly as social issues (less donor money to lose).
Thanks, lots of laymen neurologists giving quick summaries, which end up misinforming everyone. 
Humanity will eventually. I believe it's likely to be 10,000 years out versus the mountain of articles and scientists that say it will be within 50 years. I'm 27 and I'm pretty sure the generations before me are still waiting for their flying cars and/or cars that run on water. 
Yes this is what I was thinking.  Unfortunately we can only get a neuron count in the autopsy though as you say!
It's just interesting that he maintained that awareness without such a large portion of brain. 
It's odd that we'd do that considering how much brain matter is required for just our eyesight to work the way it does. Surely consciousness and thought processes would take more brain matter than just one of our senses right? Yet we still can't find it but we know where to find our eye circuitry.
The brain is not "you". In fact "you" isn't really located in any one place. The brain is another organ that generally is the processing hub but the body itself is one thing, the brain isn't "you". 
It mentions that he works as a 'civil servant', is married with two children and other sources say he first noticed the weakness in his leg while recreationally bicycling. Seems relatively 'normal', substandard IQ notwithstanding. 
This is the first thing that came to my mind reading this article. Specifically mind uploading... well not exactly mind uploading, more like gradually replacing the brain with electronic components. The main worry for me would be the ability to make sure my consciousness was still me and not just a copy of me. I suppose we can keep our consciousness in tact, if it is done slowly, like this injury.
The theory that consciousness is a product of the physical brain gets most of its empirical support from the fact that if you change something in the brain, you get a corresponding change in the mind.With this in mind, instances such as this one, where you drastically change the brain but see little to no change in the mind, have the potential to serve as counter evidence. 
I can't see any either.
Not really.
One theory is that because the individual in the article became that way gradually, his brain had time to shift functions to parts it still maintained. This is plasticity, but in the case of a small brain from birth, things may be different, but I couldn't say for sure. 
I thought the same thing when I was reading it lol
Cerebral edema will kill brain cells. Even a mild case will. If 90% of the volume of the brain is absent, we can safely assume that the entirety of (or even many of) the original cells haven't survived in some sort of compressed state.
It's because this subreddit is absolutely chock-full of pseudo-intellectuals.
Personally I think the strongest point in the post is that function is not linearly related to volume. Which we already know is true. (We know this in humans, even, but to pump your intuition realize that whales have much larger brains than us)
Howso? To clarify, as others have noted the man suffered brain damage but lucked out and retained his consciousness because critical parts of his brain were spared or adapted.What's does this situation bring to the theory of consciousness?
I had actually that very debate with Marvin Minsky on my 18th birthday- would construction of a  perfect replica of the brain allow someone's consciousness to survive? He said yes, I said no. It was great walking around the BCS lab.
Quite a few similar informed speculations on the topic, for sure. The journal Consciousness and Cognition is full of them along with countless attempts to use empirical evidence to put them to the test and refine them. The problem is shitty old school journals like that are still closed access to the public so a huge proportion of our modern understanding of these things is hidden from the public. Which is why we need to push push push for open access science.
I work in subcortical regions, and they aren't even remotely close to "mostly white matter." That being said, we've known for a long time that your brain can correct for losing huge amounts of neurons given the loss is slow (this man isn't the first known example of this kind of neural degeneration, as u/nothatkindofdoctor mentioned).
It's a quote from Cleeremons (sp?) within the linked article that he's missing "90% of his neurons". Likely inaccurate and misleading way of talking about the situation, at any rate. 90% of volume is plausible, but the brain isn't a uniformly dense homogenous 3D object made of just neurons.
The theory article (in Frontiers) linked in the OP is from 2011, enough time for other scholars in the field to reply in detail.
To be honest, I was taught this a long time ago and thought it was [relatively] common knowledge so I disregarded that point to some extent. To those who hadn't known, though, I'd agree that point helps suggest his claim very well. Also the whale example was a good one - I'm used to people using elephants haha. It's even more eye-opening when you think of a giant, dumb, blue whale.
You may have misunderstood my comment - I was quoting OP. I'm pretty sure he/she was making an arbitrarily large number.A quick Google search shows you are right. If you are under 18 your max score is 162. Otherwise it's 161.
Conflates a neuron with a brain basically. Just because individual components of a system are not conscious, doesn't imply the system as a whole is not conscious. Pretty transparently wrong, I wish Searle would cut his losses and drop it.
I'm not sure even that is true, since we can't get a consensus on whether monkeys, dolphins, dogs, spiders, or new born human babies are conscious.Arguably it's an "I know it when I experience it" thing, which only gets you as far as solipsism, unsure whether every other living thing is a p-zombie.
I don't know why you are replying to me and not midnightking. Did you make a mistake?
> The problem is shitty old school journals like that are still closed access to the public so a huge proportion of our modern understanding of these things is hidden from the public. Which is why we need to push push push for open access science.YES!
You're absolutely right, and I do a lot of work with the limbic system myself, but I overgeneralized thinking of the space between the lateral ventricles and top half of the brain. I suppose what I'd actually find most intriguing is what happened to those subcortical regions and how their function doesn't seem to be entirely lost, rather than the issue of consciousness mentioned here.
Probably, although they'd also lose basically every other characteristic that makes a human a human unless you could somehow selectively remove only those neurons that are responsible for consciousness (which might not even be possible, since it's likely widespread and not localized to one discrete region). I think it might be difficult to prove your results though, because consciousness can only be inferred through behavior, and behavior does not always correlate perfectly with consciousness.
For what it's worth, most larger animals have larger brains, because you need more neurons to control your increased limb/internal organ sizes.
Right, but people seem surprised this guy has as much IQ and normal processing as he does, despite what appears like a gigantic loss of brain volume.
As if the brain has a separate "internal" consciousness of itself, and creates a second consciousness which is endowed with the ability to interact externally. (Language, the senses, emotions etc.)
It seems obviously that way to me too, and that goes along with other things I've read about the subject, but again, I am no expert on it. I don't recall things that I was never aware of (conscious of). That doesn't mean memory of subconscious perceptions are not remembered, but it doesn't appear to be obvious that they are. Perhaps there is a subconscious memory? Who knows? But it doesn't seem to pollute conscious memory which we can deliberately recall.
I don't think it proves that at all.  It could equally prove that everything from the eye backwards is involved in creating consciousness.  For all we know, the entire brain could be involved in consciousness so when an area is slowly damaged, other parts of the brain are capable of taking over for it, but rapid damage to any part of the brain can disrupt it.  This seems to be the case given the man in the article is still alive and conscious, while most people who get a bullet to the brain end up dead or brain-dead even if it only damaged a much smaller percentage of the brain.
Ther are also people who say the brain IS consciousness, or that there is no consciousness, or that there is no brain.
Fair enough. I'm also incredibly interested in how all the compensation happens. If I had to guess much of the subcortical structures haven't been entirely "lost," but instead are highly reduced in number, completely changed in basic architecture, and compressed along the skull. At least that's what it kind of looks like in the MRI and would help explain how the guy functions on a very basic level.
I think you're advancing a very naive view of consciousness by stating it is made possible by 'certain neurons' in the cerebral cortex. 
The thinking behind it is that a large body mass means more inputs and outputs to the brain, so the brain to body mass ratio is pertinent as a sort of measure of computing power per input or output.
>because you need more neurons to control your increased limb/internal organ sizes.That's so cool, I never knew that. thanks for that bit of knowledge, genuinely (:
>probably mostly because they don't have hands, writing, or fire.I wish there was a quantitative way to study this. I always wonder how different we really are to other animals.
I think this individual is an outlier in the sense that most people with comparable brain volume are microcephalic and profoundly disabled.  The hemispherectomy cases are equally puzzling outliers.It is significant that there are large numbers of cases that lie far outside the normal correlation of brain volume and IQ, it isn't a freak accident.  It is probably significant that they began life with a larger brain volume that diminished.
Maybe.. or maybe there are only 2 when you split the corpus collosum. If it were possible to split the brain again, I'd wager that you would get 4 separate minds. I'd also wager that if we could directly connect two brains they would form one conscious mind.
"You might be on a big revelation here."Definitely felt like it when I was high. Then I started thinking about spiders and the uniqueness of their webs to each species and whether they move on their webs by having a definite stride length that other species can't replicate. Then I forgot about the consciousness thing until just now. 
Babies are certainly sentient, as are dogs, cats or donkeys. But none of them are sapient. Whether they are conscious, or whether sapience is required for consciousness is another question.
I get the first two possibilities but what the hell does "there is no brain" mean? Are you just referring to some degree of solipsism?
&gt; matter produces consciousnessCan you cite even one verifiable test that has taken inert matter in a controlled environment and animated it in a way that it has exhibited consciousness?It is evident in everyday life that conscious beings produce conscious beings. But when or who has ever shown that matter produces consciousness?
Yeah, I agree. This is something that haunts me, and I can never find a way to resolve it. What if dolphins, or whales, or some other unknown creature in the ocean is actually much more intelligent than us, but can't really do anything but swim around?^^^^^ph'nglui ^^^^^mglw'nafh ^^^^^Cthulhu ^^^^^R'lyeh ^^^^^wgah'nagl ^^^^^fhtagn
That makes sense, though these sorts of cases tend to be people where the damage happens *early*. Later life hemispherectomies (or even smaller ablations) have much more profound effects on adults; we are so much more plastic when young.
That's an interesting analogy.  It might suggest that in some sense the process of improving lossy compression algorithms could be converging on preserving only the features that are interesting according to the way we're wired.  I guess then the model "implemented" by the brain would define the asymptote to which all other lossy compression would aspire.
That's a damn good question that I think neuroscientists and others would really like to know the answer to.
I suspect you may be correct, especially when considering Dissociative identity disorder (AKA multiple personality disorder). I read somewhere that they've recorded some people with over a thousand distinct "people" living in their head.I wonder if we all have that; it's just that one personality dominates for life?
Lol you shouldn't have eaten Jon Snow.
Consciousness is the source of its own observation. It's hard to say if we will ever be able to say what consciousness is by using the very thing we are trying to describe to do the describing. 
It's difficult but possible to invoke and be aware of mental images without bringing any language into it. Maybe mental imagery is also a result of potential communication by drawing, but that starts to sound like the tail wagging the dog.
I think he's referring to 'brain in a vat' where our 'brains' are actually just computer programs receiving inputs from another super computer. 
Also worth noting that computer hardware does not write programs. 
"Consciousness" is a function of a neuron as much as "Economy" is a function of a person/economic agent: it simply isn't.Economy results from the interaction of economic agents: it is an emergent property of the *whole*, not of the *units*. Consciousness is the same: there are no *consciousness neurons*... consciousness is an emergent property of large-scale interactions between neurons.TL;DR: "consciousness" is not located anywhere specifically, the same way your "computer state" is not located in a specific place, but distributed among many different components
Yeah, a caveman was also not the pinnacle of intelligence, despite having almost the same 'potential' as us. Water makes building a civilization a lot harder (just take farming, which started our sedentary life: kinda hard to farm under water).
I'd like to see those studies.  As far as I'm aware multiple personality disorder has never been proven.But regardless, we all do have separate personalities.  Think about how you act with your friends compared to your grandma.  We have completely different personalities based on context and the social group we're in.
We start with cave paintings and eventually end up at the Mona Lisa (or maybe it would be more accurate to say the World Wide Web).
This.  Logic class should be taught at the middle school level after they have decent reading comprehension and core math skills.  
Ethics is mandatory depending on major. I know doctors, nurses, lawyers, engineers, etc. Are required to have an ethics course before they get a degree. Tying ethics to professional action makes alot of sense and is reinforced alot in college.
Maybe then they will finally be the generation that will fix the school system. 
Askphilosophy is a better sub. There is little to be found here.
We raise them to be deontologists anyway
Hahaha, yeah tbh is was a bit of a circlejerk inviting title. On the otherhand talking about it might actually make change more likely! Whereas agreeing that we all like cute puppies probably wont change anything :P
That's the case in France. In my final year of highschool philosophy was one of my main subjects. 
I think we should be doing both things.  A basic financials class is a gaping hole is public school curriculum - balancing accounts, calculating interest, etc.But knowing logic is critical to learning quite a bit of biology, chemistry and physics.  Understanding formal logic at least a little should help people follow what's happening during experimental design and writing methods sections of reports.
It's not developmentally appropriate for young children in many cases.
Math itself is philosophy, in a different form(logic).  Some basic principles are covered when discussing the Scientific Method.  I think in general it comes down to interest.   Kids have so many things in their lives pulling in different directions that to devote enough time in understanding philosophy doesn't happen.Hell,  look how history is taught and tested.  Most history teachers approach history from a purely factual basis(memorizing dates, events).  Tying different events together doesn't happen.
nothing encourages children to question the accepted truth then to teach them what to read and how to interpret it. 
Could you care to explain how it would be bastardized? Don't confuse bastardized for simple, if that's what you're thinking.
I totally agree with you. My daughter is going into the 7th grade, and I've started teaching her about logic and logical fallacies at home, because they do or learn anything about it in school. Not that I'm an expert, but I believe that critical thinking and reasoning skills are more important that memorizing facts and dates. 
I'm a programmer... Logic is very important for programming. Much more important than higher level math (only a subset of programmers use geometry/trig/calc but we all use logic.) However, there are a bunch of other things that one needs to learn in order to program that doesn't involve logic. And if a kid doesn't plan/want to be a programmer, they might think logic isn't necessary in their life. I think it's better as its own class so that more relevant issues can be discussed rather than programming problems.
Put me off for a decade and half before I embraced it lovingly.
Two great points:1. Biological development of the prefrontal cortex2. Ability of high school teachers to adequately teach philosophy.I'd love to see it taught, but it would have to be extremely simplified because of these two points.
No, I'm sorry. No. Kids are not little adults. Their brain is not just smaller, it is drastically different.While I do agree that school destroys creativity in children, I do not agree that you can teach philosophy to little children and expect them to get any of it. Or care about it.You can prepare them for philosophy by giving them logic courses or *maybe* some kind of History of Philosophy class. That could work in middle school, and philosophy could work great in high school.
It would, now people don't realize what they are doing to themselves when they spend money or have credit card debt. It's not because they are stupid it's because they simply have never been exposed. Especially in lower income families, the parents don't know, schools don't teach them, and yet we expect them to be successful. It's lunacy to think that would work. 
Literally anyone who wants the masses well educated wants grade school reform. Also we need to pay teachers more. The quality of teachers has gone down because quality teachers are now actively making a decision to make less so that you can be a teacher. And the ones who do that are wonderful and I had many in my years of education, but I also had many who that's the only job they could get and they didn't actually want to teach.   Reform is necessary, double to triple the budget would be ideal. 
I went to a religious (episcopal) private school in a very red state, and our religion credits were satisfied by ethics or comparative religion, which was just a study of major religions. We did have required chapel service weekly but it focused on ethics, philosophy, morality, and current events rather than preaching religion. Not all religious private schools are terrible. 
> It was also then I questioned why my Jesus would be any different from any of the bajillions of gods created by every other ancient civilizations. One thing that differentiates him from most of those is that he probably actually existed and if the texts are anything to go by was a swell guy. For many ancient gods it
Here in Germany we could choose beween religion or philosophy.  The lazy idiot I was chose religion. It was easy subject, but nowadays I wish I would have chosen philosophy
Virtue ethics mate
What, in schools? 
As much as I think philosophy would be a great core subject, it's hard enough to get people to pay for subjects like art and music, where you can actually create something that you can show people. Philosophy is literally just thinking, so it would be an easy target for politicians to skewer for "frivolous spending". I mean, maybe if philosophy were taught more rigorously then people would have the mental wherewithal to realize how full of shit those politicians are, but what do I know \*Kermit meme\*
Philosophy has been used to justify every abhorrent event in modern human history. The maxims of certain schools of thought are often used in and of themselves rather than as a framework for thought. Remember the Nazis? 
Especially in the modern era, where facts and dates are readily available.
That's pretty logical
My philosophy education started with Epictetus' Enchiridion. It's an easy read, free, and has some thoughts and ideas that can directly benefit anyone's life rather than requiring a specific ideology. It was a great way to warm up the brain into thinking in different ways and trying to objectively and subjectively interpret points of view. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is also a good follow up - it's a fairly easy read, and also has some good, practical thoughts in it.
Went to a SLAC. Had the opposite experience. I wonder if the big state school model just doesn't work too good for fields that really need discussion.
I mean, very few people are going to be a Hegel or a Russell. But that's the same in every field. They all have their giants.
I think maybe our definition of kids is different - I'm thinking middle school and high school. I was still throwing horse shit at fence posts in elementary school you won't get an argument from me that we should be teaching philosophy to them. 
Imagine if everyone in America set up a retirement fund and education funds for their kids. Fucking imagine it.Quality of life would skyrocket in a generation.
This is a website populated by a majority of Americans, which is the context I am discussing it in.
To uneducated laymen on the internet.
I guess that's true. But I am more concerned with the implicitly absorbed methods of thinking and the assumptions carried from one biased, ignorant teacher to the next until all of a sudden they discover "philosophy" and have to unlearn nonsense they carried with them - if they do at all.
> it's hard enough to get people to pay for subjects like art and music, where you can actually create something that you can show people. Philosophy is literally just thinkingIn contrast to the materials and utils you need to create artworks, thinking is rather cheap though.
I remember Godwin's Law. Philosophy alone cannot be blamed. Speaking of the Nazis, you may as well point at the art academy that Hitler was denied from and make an argument against art as a whole, specifically how it can create elitism. Anything can be used to justify anything, I think it's more about how _well_ the justification holds up. 
Don't forget that alternative facts and fake news are also readily available in the modern era. Gotta learn to look out for those.
Formal logic can rescue us! The argument has this format: P implies Q. P. Therefore, R. "All men are Socrates" is a completely different sentence, formally, from what's in the rest of the argument. Another way to think of it: all dogs are mammals. My dog Fido is a mammal. Therefore, all dogs are my dog Fido. That's obviously silly. 
Yes, the argument for requiring Algebra in early grades is that it is a good surrogate for Logic... Why not just teach Logic though if that's what we are trying to get kids to learn?
In that case I agree. They are ready for logic courses or intro to philosophy courses in middle school for sure.
I don't want to think about it... I'm at work and a half chub wouldn't be acceptable. 
understandable but my statement still stands
Still have to pay a teacher, provide a room, get textbooks, etc. It's not about how *much* money you're spending, it's about the fact that you're spending any money at all for something the legislators don't think citizens need.Which is pretty much anything that doesn't make us into better worker drones to feed the corporations and subsequently the legislator's campaign slush funds. /conspiracytheory
Unfortunately, faulty logic spoken loudly is winning. There's gotta be a super-logic that, uh, trumps, the BS.  
All dogs have four legs. Fido has three. Therefore, Fido is not a dog.
We are all redditors? That's all I've got. that, and a bit of a headache.
If CS 101 students were struggling with [!False=True], how do you expect kids to understand that?
I see. :)Half of the marks were for just memorisation, but there was another half where you did have to properly argue them. So forming logical arguments and communication was a part of the course.Saying that there was so much actual content to learn, and any of it could come up, that I think for the vast majority of students all we actually did was try to focus on our memorisation as that's all that felt that mattered at least. It's a shame, I did love the content but having to try to remember each and every fact about it kind of ruined it a bit for me. 
Didn't say you were wrong.
You'll be happy to hear that history and schools has changed a lot. It no longer simply deals only with dates and events but aims to create more understanding around the human factor. At least where I'm from. Source: Am a High school history teacher. 
There is! Just say "my logic is the best logic! No one else has better logic than me!"
Who doesn't?
The argument is valid, just not sound. 
Yeah I probably tried to simplify too much. 
That's great to hear. The whole reason we need to study history is to understand why things happened in the past, so we can steer things in a different direction (usually). Thanks for all you do, by the way. I know I couldn't handle a roomful of teenagers politely.
 There's a name of a logical fallacy for that but it escapes me.
There's no fallacy, just an untrue statement, "all dogs have four legs" ignores the reality that some dogs have more or fewer legs because of injury or genetic mutation
If something is both true and false the whole statement is false.
Thanks, I didn't understand the odd point triangle thingy.
it was my introduction, I read others, but it was the first philosophical book that was able to grab my attention.
I still do this!
That book really sucked me in, one of the handful of books that I felt really made an impact. But what really took me for a ride was the epilogue. I have a sibling with the same condition as his son.
You meant a lot to that teacher, I hope you appreciate that.
I have been meaning to write Pirsig and failed to.  This really bums me out.  It's been a few years since I read ZMM and Lila. It's time I give them another go. 
I think it took me three months to finish it. It almost demands that level of introspection, I think. I can't say I enjoyed the book, but I certainly took something from it - a new way of seeing the world, perhaps. 
> I wouldn't be a professional philosopher now if I hadn't read Pirsig when I was an undergrad.You can't blame him for your career choices./s
I felt it was very annoying. The author tried very hard to intentionally not understand certain things, mostly "quality". Not surprised he went nuts.
My dad had schizophrenia before he eventually took his life. You think this is a good book for me to read?
I definitely agree. His metaphysics of quality in Lila really helped me figure out an objective morality as an 18 year amoral idiot. 
I feel like a major theme of the book is that subscribing solely to objectivity or subjectivity leads to your own demise.The protagonist has suffered a major breakdown wrought by trying to dice the universe into a million pieces. He seems more in touch with reality focusing on the details of one machine, but slowly realizes he can't put his own journey in context without also understanding the other places he's been  
I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction. It's very lengthy and dull to someone who isn't used to the style. But I would recommend it to non-philosophers who like to think about stuff from time to time. 
Having read them both, I think reading Lila before ZMM would be an interesting approach.
FWIW, I think of it as a real and rather substantial novel.  Whether or not it's substantial philosophy depends on your point of view.  I will say that I've read it at least eight times, and each time it seems like a different book.  Not sure what that means, but it seems like a good thing.
Please be sure you read it. I owned it for years before cracking it open in my mid 20's. I still wish I'd have read it the moment I acquired that first copy. Now I buy as many used copies as I can find when book shopping and give them away to my friends. It blew the doors off of my reality, and I hope it will yours as well...in a good way.
Those are the two books I consider the most influential in my personal life, with *Cuckoo's Nest* edging out *ZMM* for top spot.  Mental health aside, they both are wonderful and extremely insightful books about being authentic to one's self, and being mindful.
Username checks out. 
I forced myself to finish it thinking there was something there because of all the praise.  I didn't get anything out of it. At all.  It's not a great or even good book in my opinion, although it seems from this thread that I'll be in the minority in thinking that.  
My mom loaned me her pink copy. It changed my life, started me on a whole new path towards goals I never knew I had before. I know I'm not your dad, just an anonymous stranger on reddit...but I highly recommend you make that trip. You will not regret it.
It's better for novices. Accomplished mechanics have already found their zen. So yeah, it's more philosophy and story than motorcycle stuff. 
> straight up changed my life forever. I try to keep what I learned at the forefront of my mind at all timesSame. Have you read Lila?
Just ordered the book zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. It sounds awesome.
What a delightful surprise. And yet, how unsurprising!
mental masturbation is a worthless term only used to feel superior to things. if you have a criticism of the book, share it. your comment helped nobody, and similar comments will never teach anything worthwhile, except for an easy way to deride something.
Ha. And here I am also giving away many copies, of Lila.
Explain how please
There is only now. Crack it open.
It's funny looking back. I read it knowing absolutely nothing about philosophy. Now I know a little and it dawns on me that he might have tried to combine Plato's ideas of epistemology  (quality is participating in ideal) and Aristoteles' ontology, by way he tried to divide everything to make sense of it. 
godel, escher, bach: an eternal golden braid
it's funny you should ask if it's good. because the idea of 'good' is what it's about. just read the opening quote by phadreaus.
kind of a successor of sorts to "on the road"
this is why i think his contribution was more than just a small one. zen is a really interesting read and is a lot more accessible than a lot of philosophy texts tend to be. there's more to his contribution than just the volume of it, zen is a fantastic intro to philosophy and it was the first book to really get me into it.
I have a friend who can be ... difficult to deal with, because he's always predicting terrible things, always tearing down instead of building up.But one day, out of the blue, he said to me something along the lines of:> You're a winner.  You've survived.  Simply by making it as far as you have, on as little as you have, shows tremendous grit.  You have already won the race, all you need to do is keep going, one foot in front of the other and you'll get there. Was the single most edifying thing anyone has said to me, probably in the last decade if not longer.
I mean... it definitely has to do with mental illness. Freud even wrote that as soon as people began to question why or question god they were inherently sick.
And, I still get push back from my friends for offering to sully an expensive machine with a cheap repair.
Ditto. I'd read it while away on a co-op engineering assignment over the winter. The following summer I was fussing with my bicycle and realized that I could cut a aluminum can up and shim the gear shift just like described. It was a good moment and a perfect solution. 
I very much did/do, a lot of people saw him as crazy: but he was a really intelligent man, just eccentric in how he spoke. By far one my favorite people to have talked with about philosophy and history.
He was one of the few who actively challenged me, knowing school bored the hell out of me. It kept me engaged, and always coming back to learn, because he was the only one who taught instead of banked things into me for tests.
It really is, sad in a few ways though. Works that have brought different thoughts into our lives that help us or push us forward. Yet we forget about them till the artist has passed on.
Read Lila too. It's even better. 
I need to finish it eventually. I've been 75% of the way done many times and have yet to complete it. Hopefully this summer 
Ive been reading it when I have time on the bus and its taken me a few months, Im guessing if he read it in a week he had some free time on his hands :)I feel like its the kind of book that doesnt change much, but I could be wrong as Im still young and reading it for the first time :) But it doesnt seem like it has too many layers or subtext, so I feel like if you got it the first time, you got it
Man and son take a motorcycle cross country tripMan also talks about philosophy, centeraling around modes of thought, and balance between "romantic" and "classical" thinking - and how many cant accept technology (it was written in the 60's)Good book, hard to summarize in a paragraph as Im not done. Id look it up
That was the point. The initial quest to figure out quality was his gumption trap, much like the broken screw that throws off the assembly. This second attempt at figuring it out was him making sure to have the balance he learned from motorcycle maintenance in order to figure out quality without becoming so attached to the weight of his inquiry that it would destroy him.
Yes. Not as truth, but as one person's truth, profoundly and beautifully expressed.I'm very sorry to hear of the loss of your father.
It's really inspiring to hear that. Some moral frameworks provide little practical guidance (and some too much). MOQ strikes a good balance, and I've found it helpful that way, too.
There is actually a mountain bike maintenance book called Zinn and The Art of Mountain bike Maintenance by Lennard Zinn.
Lol, someone's got a little bit of a chip on the shoulder eh? 
The sequel, Lila, addresses the elements that were unfinished in the first book. The travelogue is not as good as the motorcycle stuff but the intellectual forays in the sequel are much better. Even superb. I doubt you'll read any book that will change the way you see the world as usefully and as much as will Lila.
Last thing I remember is a long rant about "quality" and education and how he was a teacher or something like that. That's as far as I got. Perhaps I didn't get to the "enlightening" climax of the book...
I wish... I have a 15 year old beater Dodge...
Awesome. I almost gave it away to a friend who needed some help with zen and motorcycle maintenance a few weeks ago. She was detoxing, manic and going through a messy break up when her bike broke down in peak hour on a busy bridge in pouring rain. She texted me while she was there. I texted her back to cover of the book as a bit of comic relief for a shitty situation.I will read it and will def pass it on to her.
Yeah, I'm glad I'm not alone here. I dunno, MAYBE I'll try giving it another go. 
Is there any difference's in the book, based on the color of the cover?
Hope you enjoy! It's a slow one you have to digest bit by bit, but a wholesome experience.
Since masturbation is a harmless and pleasurable activity, I have never fully grasped its use in the negative. Is it "you are merely enjoying the pleasure of this, without producing a lifelong commitment?"
How about something that isn't completely beyond the reading level of ZMM?
*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* is not a "philosophy book". It's about philosophy and a mental illness but "philosophy book" is something else. Great book anyway.
There is a substantive discussion here? I thought we were just paying our respects. Am I allowed to do that? Find something more important to whine about
I agree.  I disliked philosophical reading because it was over my head.  This introduced me to it in a very approachable way, and from there I was able to revisit frustratingly complex works I had disliked because I hadn't understood their underlying messages.  It's a great gateway book.
_The Plague_ by Camus_Nausea_ by Sartre I'm sure a lot of people will also suggest Camus's _The Stranger_, and it is fantastic. But _The Plague_ might be more of a novel, so it might be more appealing. It's also just ... really excellent and a bit under appreciated. You might like _Sophie's World_ for a kind of novelized approach to the history of Western philosophy. 
There's always that one idiot who brings in current-politics into every single thread, no matter how unrelated it may be.Despite your narrow worldview blinkered by your political ideology, the world is still on an upward trajectory, same as it was 1 year earlier. On the whole, things are still getting better much more than they are getting worse.    Go back to /r/politics aka /r/LiberalCirclejerk
it took me three or four tries to get theough that section.i had a semi serious mental break and a friend brought me this book.  it took me years to finish it, but when i finally understood, i felt this huge relief that at least one other person on this Earth felt how i feel.  i had read Siddharta 10 times by then but this one got me.
Just cut some into rectangles, polish the labeling off, and keep it on hand. They'll never know where it came from.
I have a teacher just like this. The crazy ones are always the best.
Couldn't say, but thank you
I'll look into it.  Thanks for the suggestion!
I have an autographed copy of Christine by Stephen King... I need to scan that sucker in
So it's not just me then? The first time my dad gave me it to read I was only about 20 and I think even still too young for it. I read most of the book but I don't think I took much of it in. I started a second time about a year ago and read a large portion of it again only this time I actually took it in. If I did find myself reading a bit but missing the point I re read it until I got it. This was a lot more enjoyable but still I ran out of stamina and stopped reading again. Perhaps now is the time to try for the third time lucky.
ZMM made me rethink how I approach my work, both in my vocation and in my hobbies.  I hope to eventually teach a class about the philosophical and ethical aspects of work, and plan to include ZMM in the curriculum.I think chapters 25 and 26 are the two most important ones in the book, especially for tradesmen whose entirely livelihood depends on the quality of their work.
It's in the ether.
But he never figures it out and in the end he's not doing so well. In fact he outright rejects simple and reasonable explanations because he just doesn't like them. He's twisting himself up over the fact that he wants answers to be different then they are and is building intricate epicycle like reasoning just to avoid simple explinations of quality.
Intentionally not understanding things is something philosophers are good at.
I don't know if this will help, but did you ever read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card?There's a scene in which the hero, Ender Wiggin, who is ten years old or something and super smart, walks into a room of teenagers playing video games and instantly is able to beat them all at video games that the older kids have been playing for years. Because Ender is just that super smart.It is very empowering if you don't know anything about video games and very silly if you do.Phaedrus totally destroying all the silly philosophers is on that level.
Sounds about right. I'm glad it seemed to help or enlighten a lot of people, though, I just didn't understand the appeal and a lot of it rubbed me the wrong way. 
If you have to ask you'll never know
I'm pretty addicted to mental masturbation. It's not harmless. It's a form of procrastination. 
the agony and the ecstasy.
How is the book about mental illness?
I'm just curating the intellectual lightweights out of the discussion, little fry guy. Let's aim for "up, up, and away" when we post our comments, shall we?  Atta boy!  
I've read The Plague probably a half-dozen times. It's an absolute masterpiece -- one of the best, if not *the* best novel of the 20th century. Imo, of course. 
*VALIS* is an insight into insanity for sure.
Username not relevant to the comment made
Crazy teacher here. Thanks. 
Nah, I can see that. After some brilliant opening chapters the book is losing steam. It just meanders on, and the big conclusion never really comes.I've heard his second book "Lila" is supposed to be better - esp. on the philosophical side.
Interesting. I've often told people that if they feel bored with it to skip the first 100 pages because those are the most boring and drawn out. 
Phaedrus twists himself up over it, Pirsig at this point in his life does not. It's almost a historical account of his past from the view point of another person who took his place. And he does sort of figure it out, it's awfully similar to Plato's concept of the good. You can't really answer it like you can a math equation, it's more about the journey and learning how to think. He says it in the beginning chapter, it's often better to travel than to arrive.
I had a philosophy teacher in university who I would describe as using way too many words to explain simple concepts.  He would go to such an extreme that I actually had difficulty parsing those simple concepts.  But I've also been exposed to incredibly succinct philosophers.  The first one I mentioned was just a bad teacher.  Unfortunately, that was my experience in most subjects in university.
Uhhhh, okay? Lol
Exactly. I can't even explain it. It did "rub me the wrong way". Now I want to give it another try just to see what it was.
**SPOILER ALERT**Did you read the book? I don't want to spoil it but the whole thing is about the narrator being schizophrenic; or better put it tracks his, Phaedrus', mind and ideas that lead to his mental breakdown. He then, years later, goes back to this place with his son and relives the whole thing and reconciles with his past. That's the whole plot of the story.
It's literature really. I know that it is autobiographical but it's a story at the end of day, not a non-fiction philosophy book; i.e. it does not have a philosophical project, arguments that support a philosophical position and answering philosophical questions. It may make you think, it may make you think about philosophical question too, but that doesn't make it automatically philosophy book.
Which one? It's been a long time I read it, can't remember any cringe passage on top my head.
What translation do you recommend? 
Damn, I really like Camus, and I really liked The Stranger, how did I miss that one?
Yes, Herman Hesse should definitely be mentioned in this little thread, I think he practically started this kind of wisdom literature. Steppenwolf is a great starting place.
Moby-Dick. 
Did you make it far enough to get to Anny's discussion of "privilleged moments?" I definitely agree, his writing is really powerful and can make you feel as he describes, but powering through it is so rewarding and the end of the novel is a lot easier to get through. 
I happened to be reading it when I fell ill with pneumonia. My friend who came over with chicken soup rolled her eyes when she saw the title and accused me of being overly dramatic. 
Lilas writing comes off as more  practical and tangible than zen. I found myself rereading sections of zen due it being so dense while Lila was a bit easier . Both amazing  books though 
But his journey sucked and he didn't learn anything except a bunch of semantic philisophical arguments which he used to avoid dealing with the fact that he just didn't like that the universe wasn't magic.I guess that's the analogy to the motorcycle. He learned all these tricks to keep his beater running and uses the fact that he's riding a broke ass bike to look down on everyone else instead of just getting a better bike.
What rubbed me wrong is the guy saying how high his iq was from the start. There was so much self righteous, iamsosmart and iamsoenlightened trash in it. blaming his friends marriage  problems on a leaky facet, bagging on him for wanting his bike properly fixed instead of using a pop can, out teaching the professors that are his colleagues. Then going on a rant about the semantics of quality was too much
He's definitely not schizophrenic. I'd call it dissociative identity disorder, if anything at all. He wasn't all there at times, but at least according to the book he didn't have a diagnosable illness. 
I will agree with you that it does not follow any kind of 'traditional philosophical structure,' and by that definition, you are correct, it is not a philosophical book.
Maybe "cringe" isn't the perfect word, but I read this book about 15 years ago and every time a conversation started I just kept thinking *people don't really talk like this*.  It just seemed very forced.I need to give it another read and see if I still feel the same way.
Gilbert is the definitive translation, but I've heard good things about Buss, but haven't read that one. I've also worked my way through the original French (La Peste), and for the most part it was worth the work.
It's fucking awesome.  Read it.
_Steppenwolf_ definitely should have been in my comment, too. Good call. 
I didn't and am thinking now that I should give it another go. I've re-read the Stranger and the Fall recently and got a lot from them. I just remember experiencing something almost like vertigo reading it. 
Lila is indeed far more practical then Zen. Separating value into independent levels of Inorganic, Biological, Social, and Intellectual allows me to solve much cognitive dissonance in my life about competing priorities, and how to sort them. It is good.
Haha same, brother. 
Man, I'm sorry that's what you took away from the book. Maybe try it again in a few years. 
Not to be too pedantic, but you do realise that the point he was making about the beer can shim was that it IS the right way to fix it. He was saying an aluminium shim, is an aluminium shim wether you make it yourself, or buy it from BMW.  The only difference is perceived quality. While I agree there is a strong thread of r/iamverysmart woven thru the whole book, it is meant to be his internal musings, so it's bound to come off that way. Anyone's internal monologue would. 
Well, the book is vaguely based on author's own life. Robert M. Pirsig was indeed diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Also, I read that book 5 years ago, but as far as I remember schizophrenia part was pretty clear and maybe the climax of the whole novel.
Well, as a huge Blade Runner fan, I'm going to go with November, 2019. It's a holy date to us fans.
I definitely get what you mean, Camus has a really good mastery of prose and his characters' narrations aren't as unsettling, even if they're equally as bleak as Sartre's.   I would definitely recommend giving Nausea another go. I haven't read the Fall and haven't read the Stranger in years, I'll need to revisit those soon. 
Why? It's a book about a guy carrying around cobbled together junk that tells other people with cobbled together junk that they are special. I don't think I'm going to "like it" in a few years. Books that feed feelings of exceptionalism to the disaffected tend to have the most effect around a certain age, which I've passed.I mean, I didn't like it so I guess I didn't understand it.
> trying too hard to be "deep""Let's try to explain the concept of tao making it seem more complicated."It's like Capra explaining quantum physics and Jon Krakauer explaining transcendentalism in Into the Wild.I put them all in the same category on my bookshelf.
I did get the point about the the beer can shim. It was the air of judgement about it. It caused him throw his friend into a category.I don't think internal musings would always come off that way. He thinks a lot of himself and thinks he's misunderstood and that comes off in his writings. 
Does it have to be a dissertation to convey philosophical concepts? Taoism is a school of philosophical thought which was taught primarily through allegory. Surely a compelling story behind the search for the meaning of quality works as well as a thesis paper. His mental condition and the road trip were simply vehicles to carry the progression of his earlier search and provide a compelling story arc.
And yet it solves Hume's Guillotine better than your philosophical Canon does...
He was not bipolar. He was paranoid schizophrenic, with an extra helping of anxiety and clinical depression.
Yeah its really worth a go. The Fall is really really good. It doesn't read like a philosophy novel and I can't be sure I really got the full point, except that the main character's ridiculous actions are really no more ridiculous than anything else one does; but it's great. It's absolutely hilarious. He has a lot in common with Don DeLillo or even Tom Wolfe/Bret Easton Ellis/DFW. Comedy in fatalism. 
You're treating it like you're superior to the book, and it sounds like you haven't actually read the book. The motorcycle is a metaphor for yourself. I'm not sure how it's about cobbled together junk as you describe it, It's also not about people who are disaffected at all, it had nothing to do with that so I'm not sure where you're coming from. Acting superior is something his former personality did a lot in the book. I'm sorry you feel that way, maybe don't try it again if you're going to try and just rip everything apart. If you think the motorcycle is cobbled together junk, well then...
Guys like Huangbo and Foyan would probably claim that Quality is at best an expedient to teach the dull and at worst a conceptualization that chains you to dualistic thinking. Quality necessitates the existence of Non-Quality. Zen has no interest in labeling of forms because all forms are void, empty of objective meaning. This negation of forms serves to affirm not the mind that creates Quality, but the mind where Quailty cannot exist. Such a mind is no-mind.
That is only true of you are from the reader response school of literary criticism. Some of the other schools try to be more objective while others place the work with in a cultural or historical context.  
Why is that "sad" though? How is it any different than doing a thesis on platonic dialogs?
I didn't like how harsh he was to his son, multiple times. Like when they'd drive for hours through freezing fog or something and his kid would be crying and complaining asking for a break. When it said in the postscript that his son had been murdered it made the whole thing even more tragic. 
My mistake. 
Could you direct me to a page or a section or a quote from Lila? Something you found fascinating.
Born in the 80's and had a similar experience.First read blew my mind.  Some of the philosophical concepts challenged my worldview in ways I had never experienced.Many years later, I reread it and saw that this book wasn't really about that.  If anything, his philosophy was the antagonist in a story about his struggles to be a good father, and live a good life.
What ever you say. 
Tom Wolfe is one of my favorite authors and a friend recommended The Fall to me, so I'll definitely have to check it out.  
Read through the comments here. You will see many people arguing that race is really important and a genetic absolute. Citing laughably archaic schools of thought about skull and brain size to justify pseudo racist babble. 
He literally says that it's known for a long time but has to be spoken out loud on a larger scale. 
Centuries. 
I felt it added to discussion
In what way did nation-states bring the world prosperity and technological process? Why would the technological and economic progress of the last two centuries not have occured if states had been arranged in a different manner?
Yeah, I've been noticing some pretty badly misinformed and racist comments. I guess that's justification enough for the post, at least if anyone actually bothers to read the article seriously. I originally meant that it was widely acknowledged in the academic realm, though. 
Not exactly. Biological racism and phrenology were considered legitimate fields of study until well into the 20th century.
Again: The claim that X is a social construct is not the claim that X is not real.
I'm not saying it's racist to acknowledge race... Race is real in the same way that language, culture, and money are real. It exists, but people made it, it wasn't there all along.
I hope the mods can find that even if something is flippantly wrong it can still add to the discussion. I'd hate for the racists to be entirely dismissed and would like to have minor inconsistencies elaborated against. (not that I necessarily find the comment in question an example of)
Its about the organisational scale from tribe to village to city to state that allows for greater scientific progress.
These Schools of thought are archaic because we now have enough evidence to soundly label them as hog wash.
I would say they archaic because they proved their conclusions using archaic hogwash, whereas now we have much better data to arrive at similar conclusions.
r/philosophy: Question whether or not reality exists, but never ever even dare to mention race.But to answer your point, can't we discuss what merits an "established scientific fact"? That is, after all, what most of the people talking about race here want to do. They dispute your definition and believe they have a better one. Yet you don't want to discuss it, you just want to bury your head in the sand and pretend all science backs up what you want to believe.That's what it looks like anyway.
A continuum suggests two opposite extremes. Race does not simply follow the lone axis of skin color, like beardedness does the axis of beard length.
> A continuum suggests two opposite extremesWell, no, it doesn't.  For example a 3 dimensional space can be continuous, as in Euclidean geometry.Not that that's relevant, because the continuum *fallacy* just means trying to deny that a distinction is real just because there is no strict dividing line.  That is invalid reasoning.For the continuum fallacy, it doesn't matter if the distinction is binary or not, nor does it matter whether it's linear or not.  (Color is a linear continuum, but not a binary.  Consider red, green, and blue.)
I think you're misunderstanding the fundamental point I'm trying to make. I'm not saying there isn't a distinction between races, i'm saying the distinction is arbitrary.You're right about the nature of a continuum, though. The model you seem to be proposing is interesting, though. If we were to create a racial continuum with multiple axes, what would the axes be? Hair texture? Presence or lack of the epicanthic fold? Eye color?
Oh wow you edited this.  OK.  > The model you seem to be proposing is interesting, though. If we were to create a racial continuum with multiple axes, what would the axes be? Hair texture? Presence or lack of the epicanthic fold? Eye color?How about you just treat it the same as any taxonomic subspecies categorization for any other species?
This is a pretty nasty can of worms you're opening. What 'sub-species' would you propose for humans?
It was 3 am when saw this and now it's 5 am. I haven't slept but I found the meaning of life.Thanks Reddit
Watch Jordan Peterson's other videos on nihilism if you want to see him completely dissect and refute it.
For one, the video is a two hour long static master shot. Like it or not, there is an abundance of content available today, and audiences must compartmentalize what media they consume. Unfortunately, a two-hour long video of a seminar (that is shot rather dull) is not going to reach a broad audience.
I felt like I was watching a three hour version of some the better scenes in Ghost in the Shell. "blah blah blah well Baudrillard said this blah blah that reminds of a quote from Rossaeu okay cool the Bible said this..." I've seen this kind of thing in fiction and I love it, never thought an unscripted conversation between philosophers like that could be possible and so entertaining.
Peterson or Vervaeke? Let them know next class that this conversation has been going viral. I went to UofT but unfortunately never took a class by either professor. Working my way through Petersons youtube channel lectures currently.
Yeah, these guys are smart and thoughtful, and worth listening to.
And that right there, that's it.
Translating between languages can lose nuance and meaning. So can translating the words you actually think into the most common words and speech patterns. Because we're familiar with transforming our thoughts into language, a sentence formulated in a specific way in a specific context can convey ideas that a different sentence that means the same exact thing on the surface does not. I doubt they're using certain words just to look smart. They're trying to be understood by each other with as much accuracy and precision as possible.
It looks like the bot didn't show up, but hello 
Interestingly enough, Dennis McKenna (Terence's brother, a botonist) was a keynote speaker along side Peterson and Vervaeke at a conference revolving the matters of Mind, Consciousness, and Reality. This year's topic was 'Altered States'.
Have you tried randomly jumping in the video and finding out for yourself?
I think it's just expensive water
Just type in Jordan B Peterson on youtube, he posts all his UofT and Harvard lectures for free, he also has two TedX talks.
Sorry for being four months late, but I'm really interested, how would you define 'meaning'? I personally see 'meaning' and 'function' as synonyms
The irony in this comment...
mp3juices.cc can do long videos, just tried this one and it works.
Clears up after a few minutes, I promise! :)
The quality gets better around the three minute mark if you didn't make it that far. skip ahead to see what I mean
Not for the way they define meaning, a definition that they reach by speculating what one truly wants out of that answer.
r/philosophy all day, Joe Rogan by night? All day?You should watch though, as Joe himself would encourage the expansion of your mind.
You need to be able to show your meaning to others, and try to understand theirs also.
The key point:The Western tradition has tended to abstract out meaning from the World. In fact, we are deeply embodied in the World, structuring our very stance towards the meaning. Grave existential crises are balanced against the need to have projects in the World.  The meaning is *how* to interact, the fitting in with the World. We don't see objects, we see meaning.See:Merleau-Ponty  Phenomenology of PerceptionRusson The Self and Its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit
A professor who changes lives. a'doy
Most probably.
I bet the euphoria wore off by now. Heh. 
Humans live in two different worlds, reality and meaning/metaphors. Distinguishing what is real, can help us understand the opposite better. 
No surprise at all that people aren't watching it, what I find funny is the relatively high number of votes and that it's on the front page, despite that fact that hardly anyone is watching it.
Thanks much. There's always a little pleasure in knowing you share a similar journey with another, even when the journey is one of struggle.  Good luck to you as well! :)
Thanks for posting. I've been a huge fan of peterson for some time and I think his ideas would make many lives better if people took them in. I have been pushing his stuff intermittently on Reddit with mixed results. But I'll thank you again. You picked a good one and had better timing than I have had haha. Getting the word out was always the main goal... a vastly more so than the internet points anyways!
Definitely will. I still need to watch the last hour of this one haha. Lots to take in!
You're absolutely welcome. It makes me happy to know that I could make a difference for you, no you go do the same for someone else. :)
> People alluded after lectures. Kinda weird, kinda deserving.Hmm... I'm quite sure you're using "alluded" wrong.  Why is it weird that people "alluded" after his lectures?
Apparently it does happen (corroborated by many people).  Now I feel like I missed out in my college career, because I never once had a lecturer so good that they consistently got applause.  I don't recall any regular lecturer even once getting applause, just guest lecturers.
They use difficult language because they want to express their ideas in the clearest way possible. 
Do you think they are talking about some arcane or esoteric philosophical knowledge that only the initiated can grasp?
Doesn't every opinion on every facet of philosophy do that?Oops, I admitted it! You're trite comment is defeated!
Interdasting..Determinism is exactly what I'm talking about. Thanks for the info and the suggestion! I'll definitely be looking into his novels here very soon.
Paradoxical how?The way I see it, if you were to flip a coin and pause that moment an 8th of a second after that quarter left the tip if your thumb and calculated all of the forces that were exerting themselves on that quarter from launch to landing, you could predict whether it would land on heads or tails 100% of the time.Kinda like weather forecasting. With enough information and time to process it, we could predict the weather with certainty. People aren't different in that respect - we just need more information and time to make an accurate prediction.
Vervaeke, I have him for cog250. Really interesting class. I'll let him know
I agree. Usually when a word is seen as "big," it is because this particular word has a very specific meaning and is used rarely. Speaking with this kind of vocabulary allows an oral lecturer to be quite specific with their intent, avoiding confusing and adding detail to their lessons. 
Bless ppl like you
Yah, it didn't seem to with the few places I tried so I thought i would ask.
Ah, ok. I'll give it a look. It was still bad when I clicked around but that may have just been because it was loading in SQ.
Ah, you're right. I would have been very impressed.
Seriously these comments are driving me crazy. They lay out in the first 15 minutes why the question of there being **the** meaning of life is redundant and not useful.Their subsequent discussion of how people interact with meaning in their day to day lives is fascinating. The observation, though not a new one, about not being able to chose what gives you meaning I always think is thought provoking. 
So what? In other words the meaning of life is what you want out of it?
With all the writing done in this sub it's strange you're downvoted without a response.
I don't think he is. I think he just writes it off as a field.
Very good. Thank you.
no, its that reproduction is not a meaning of life for you.
If you go up to a woman in your classroom and say "man, him, dude" over and over as a teacher, after they have asked you to stop and refer to them as a woman, is that appropriate? You would rightfully have administrative action taken against you.This is the exact equivalent of what is happening to these people who identify differently than traditionally. If a professor makes a mistake or two, no one really cares. If they stubbornly keep referring to someone as "him" when they have corrected the professor time and time again, the professor is obviously making an attempt to be hostile.
Well, you have to observe that you mentioned different kinds of relationships. Human relationships are very different from the electromagnetical relationship between two atoms.
"Dogmatic materialism, perhaps?"Possibly, but even someone who would materially reduce mental phenomena to the point that they no longer exists, like Daniel Dennett, would vehemently argue that abstract things like ideas and currency exist.
So Santa is real? Jk
A "pattern of energy" in the brain? Do you have any sources or anything for energy in the brain? My understanding is that we know very little about how the brain functions, so such notions are little more than speculation.I think the notion that the brain creates consciousness is incorrect in the first place, so maybe I'm biased.
Well obviously you didn't pray hard enough because he was still hospitalized Way to go
It's painfully obvious that most commenters are just trying to dissect the video without making it passed the title or first two minutes.
Huzzah!I am excited for you
They applauded.
Realy? The only professors I have ever known of that could make people clap (outside of a one time seminar or something), the majority of their students hated. That said, I am in a very technical field so maybe it just doesn't translate, but it does feel like something that happens more in intro classes than high classes.
Sometimes that it true, other times it's not. I'll have to find a good example of a pretentious music essay so people will have a better understanding of what I'm talking about.
There's a difference between techno-jargon in a given field, and attempts to deliberately make your language sound elevated through needless complication. I was talking about the latter.
No, I think they're talking about things you just don't understand and as a way of rationalizing that you just say it's stupid. 
It's the "nothing more" part.  This is practical philosophy - it has usefulness, it can assist in programming AI or founding the relevance of math in the real or prioritizing decisions in politics.  It relates to *more*, it is *more* than you imply.I don't wish to be rude, I simply dismiss the dismissiveness that you brought to a worthwhile discussion.> The first 30 minutes were laughably badThat's condescension.  Why are you putting out trite judgements?
Now go talk to physicists about tha determinism :D
Yeah, but what we want out of it is not an easy thing to answer.  They aren't talking about conscious choice or arbitrary preference but on immutable aspects of human nature that truly drive us.  At least for the kind of "wanting" they are talking about.
Maybe I'm using the term "question begging" incorrectly?I thought it applied here since the question "what is the meaning of life" automatically assumes that life *has* a meaning. Which seems to generally fit the definitions I've seen.
Exactly my point to op 
So if someone discovers a highly effective treatment for cancer which saves many lives, but they don't have kids, then their life was meaningless? Lol fuck offff trying to act like the biggest question to ever plague mankind is that simple to answer. You can leave a mark on the world outside of creating another human.
I thought Quantumtroll and the poster he's responding to were saying something different: i.e., whatever level of description one is using to describe X, you're still describing something real (all things considered). So human relationships wouldn't be very different from atomic relationships *mutatis mutandis*.Besides, if you can find a way to describe human relationships vis-a-vis biology (or whatever, pick your privileged level of reduction), you can then pretty much find a way to describe them via however "low" you want to go.
Sure. Anything you imagine is real, in a sense.
Where do you think consciousness is derived from?
Having watched the entire video, and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I would have to concur with criticism of the title as somewhat bombastic.
Pardon me, I didn't say *anything at all* about the topic. Nor do you have any reason to believe I don't understand it.Perhaps you should re-read my original comment more closely?
Right. More money!
I don't know. It still seems to me that the comparison differs not in level of description, but in nature.It's like when they say that love is a powerful force. It's not a literal physical force, it's a metaphorical one, even though it causes changes in reality in some way.
I never stated anything about the "realness" of both relationships.I just stated that they are different in NATURE, not in DEGREE. My opinion, of course. I can't really compare one to the other the same way...I gave an example to some other guy: "love is a powerful force". It's not really a force, with vector and scalar value. It's more of a metaphor that we invented using the power of analogy.
This gives me great anxiety.
I don't think it's derived from anything. I'm inclined towards the Theravada view that consciousness and matter (what the texts call "mind" and "matter") are two independent, yet deeply interdependent forces.I think the formal teaching is called the Three Ultimate Realities-- mind, matter, and nibbana (which is the absence of the two).
Mm, yes, shallow and pedantic. I'm automatically suspicious of any topic on this sub with over 200 upvotes. Can we all agree the Reddit format doesn't exactly mesh with a vibrant philosophical discussion? This sub is a failed experiment. 
The videos are straight up meme-level punching bags on r/badphilosophy - a quick search there shows a ton of posts about them.
Yup! You have to pay for it if you want advancement. Most scientists honestly don't make a single important discovery throughout their lives, but without the funding we have shoved into the sciences we would all still be dieing of measles.
If you had put just a modicum of effort into reading what I wrote you might have noticed I specifically said it's *not* a problem of measurement. I know I didn't present a convincing self contained argument, but I simply can't give you years of physics education in a nice neat reddit comment. If you want to understand these topics you have to put in the work.
Yeah, Dogmatic Materialism *sounds* like something Dennett should be guilty of.  Which makes it a bad term for the kind of ontological fundamentalism /u/neotropic9 is objecting to.
Back in law school the whole lecture hall would clap damn near every time??
You're talking about real science. What 'advances' have we made in philosophy in the last 20 years? And by advances i mean things that have any actual effect on people's day to day lives (like a measles vaccine), not the creation of yet another masturbatory, useless philosophical theory.
Seriously? I have never experienced this. Was it kind of a Tradition to clap after a lecture? Or were your lectures all just good enough for a spontaneous clap?
Let me turn that around on you. How many advances have we made in physics in the last 20 years that affect everyone's day to day lives?As I said before, philosophy is quite different from hard sciences in that it does not have that direct correlation to what happens in the world. Philosophy is used in every Supreme Court decision ever made as well as used in creating and reforming of governments across the world. I realy do agree with you that philosophy has become too much of a circle jerk, but I don't feel it's useless like you do.
They were usually really good. Not clapping was seen as disrespectful if a professor had just been busting his ass for you for two hours... Some of the professors didn't give a shit though and we didn't clap for them.
Hey i should answer your question because you didn't answer mine! Good luck in school this year...
Don't worry I'm two years into my degree. Still even saying that to him implies his appeal to ignorance is valid.
When someone points out a flaw in your assumption in generally requires addressing.And will do. The grant my research is funded by is up for renewal and they recently cut the funding for our Aero department, so it maybe interesting...
What about efficiency? For example if someone is making a claim that is difficult to immediately verify, and I know that he/she is quite unintelligent and/or uninformed (or he/she has made an overwhelming number of incorrect claims in the past), so I just assume that the new claim is likely false. Basically "all of your previous claims have been false and I know you are not qualified to speak on this topic, so I am going to assume that your new claim is false (unless/until I become aware of evidence to the contrary)." Is this not a good practice to engage in? 
That's big when arguing with climate deniers. I brought it up with a co worker/ Trump supporter yesterday. The first complaint he made was that it had been politicized. I agreed and tried to discuss the science with him. All he would do is repeat Obama says this and Al Gore predicted that and Leonardo DiCaprio is a hypocrite. I just kept saying, "Yeah I'll give you that they're all hypocrites, but that doesn't mean anything about the science!" No use. 
Right, there's a difference between 'you're a prick so you're wrong' and 'you're wrong because of x reason, and you're also a prick'
Complete hypocircy.
The genetic fallacy is when you evaluate a position based on how likely the source is to know whether that position is true or valid. While technically a fallacy, it is amazingly useful in practice.The ad hominem fallacy is when you evaluate a position based on irrelevant characteristics of the source. While a fallacy, it can sometimes be useful -- for instance, if someone seems like they're generally deceitful or manipulative, it would be wise to ignore what they say.
Trump won this because of all of the name calling, and because the left refused to admit their own poop stinks. I've got a big mix of supporters on my social feeds and usually the conversation went like this:"But the DNC cheated Bernie..." LALALA CANT HEAR YOU"I have some issues with Hillary's thoughts on..." LALALA WOMAN HATER"I don't think Trump actually wants to..." RACISTI think this is less Ad Hominem and more identity politics, really. You're bucketizing people constantly, and then using those buckets to promote your agenda and ignore other people's opinion.
Strawman?  A strawman is when you construct an example that your argument defeats, usually by misrepresenting their argument in some way.An example would be if someone tells you that we should increase education spending, and your response is to say so that means you want Russia to invade western Europe because we'd have to cut defense spending.
You're welcome! :)
That is a different form of fallacy called argument ad verecundiam, or argument that is based on authority. 
Cheers!! Glad you're interested :)
We do this with a program called VideoScribe, by Sparkol. Great program!  We *did* it because we thought it looked cool. But we now think that *not* doing it looks even cooler.  So we no longer do this.
Didn't watch the video, huh?  The answer is yes.
The ad hominem fallacy is committed when a claim wrongly attacks an opponent, rather than that opponent's argument.  Here, "wrongly" doesn't mean "ineffectively".  A claim wrongly attacks an opponent when the claim doesn't bear on whether the opponent's argument is good or bad.  An ad hominem argument can be effective (persuasive) without bearing on whether the opponent is in fact right or wrong.
Failing to win an argument and having your opponent refuse to engage in an argument are different things.
What a strawman
We embrace fallacies for usefulness all the time. Logic is not about usefulness.
Right, the internet gets this wrong all the time. Insulting someone isn't *ad hominem* unless the insult **is** your argument. Insulting someone in the midst of your argument might make you a jerk, but it's not fallacious.
Except for when the person is the point.
> then one should never need to use ad hominem attacksJust calling someone an idiot is not automatically an ad hominem argument. "You're an idiot and here are the reasons why you're wrong," while rude, is not the same thing as saying "the reason why you're wrong is because you're an idiot."
I guess a particularly bad argument could be used as evidence to argue someone is an idiot without committing a fallacy.
Glad I wasn't the only one
Well several people have disagreed with what I said, and concluded that the video agreed with them.I don't know that what the video is arguing matters to me, even though I did watch it twice.
Why not stop at 'you're wrong because of x reason' and not be a prick? Pricks call other people pricks.
Yeah I think he also said they'll pull you down to their level and beat you with experience. Couldn't agree more.
I don't like my emotions getting the better of me, but on occasion it happens and I regret it. We all have things we need to improve on. There are some forms of ignorance I do think deserve public shaming though. Holocaust denial, Slavery and racism apologetics. I don't think white supremacist, antisemitic ideas should be tolerated by our culture. I'm all for the first amendment and not having the government regulate speech, but I do think it should seriously harm your reputation in our society to be a Neo-nazi, KKK, etc. 
The US president does have executive power though, including being commander-in-chief, thus being in control of the biggest army in the world.He'll be taking real decisions, in which case his image will be a lot less relevant.
I think it's just as insulting to portray the left as all ignorant idiots who silence their opposition.
He barely even *has* policies.
>The idea that 'liberals' don't address the ideas is ridiculousIm sure they do sometimes, but are drowned out by all the clickbait faux outrage over things like "Trump stands creepily behind Clinton during debate", "Trump manterrupted Clinton during debate", "Trump displays symptoms of an emotional abuser", "Trumps words trigger my PTSD", "Trump called me a cunt 30 years ago and therefore misogyny"  
Okay thankyou, idk why I said scarecrow... I just know I used to get them confused.
Oh, sorry. I've watched this video before and I forgot about that part. I just watched it after making that comment.
I would seriously like an explanation of that because I would be open to changing my view if I'm wrong. However, I did say that the statement was false because it provided no empirical evidence so it had to come from personal experience which is inherently biased. Making judgments against groups based on biased personal experiences is by definition racist (or at least prejudiced). 
So if it 'rightfully' attacks an opponent, it is no longer a fallacy? And if the aim is to persuade (ie win the argument) then does it matter (in a non-philosophical context) if the person is attacked rather than the argument?Obviously the difference is that by attacking the argument we are able to have a conversation, while attacking the person halts this debate. However when there is no conversation possible (if this person maintains absolute power over the conversation by sitting at the top of the top-down communication) then where does that leave the argument?
I believe that is a bandwagon fallacy 
> When the argument is about a person's character, an attack on their character is not an ad hominem.All character evidence submitted to prove the fact of the matter asserted is ad hominem.  Not all ad hominem arguments are fallacious.
Well, there is a point when you have them between people who are sparing in their wrongness.But I actually agree with you, and your point makes the ad hominem even less offensive.  It actually *is* relevant if someone is *usually* wrong, so saying such is meaningful if the discussion is on something with any nuance at all.Moreover, I think people are far too apt to call "ad hominem" as a *defense of their own argument* rather than trotting out facts.  As in "you used an ad hominem, therefore I don't have to defend my argument."
If we want to be technical, I should have said a fallacy doesn't mean the *conclusion* of an argument is incorrect.  The argument would in fact be invalid, but that doesn't mean its conclusion is false.    2 + 2 = 5    Therefore, the sky is blueThat is not a valid argument, but its conclusion is true.
But this isn't really a logical fallacy, it's more like a rule of thumb. People are often too quick to just rattle off a list of them with no explanation, usually because they take the word "fallacy" to mean that it's never a valid way to argue. The subtleness of informal fallacies means that people often see them when they aren't really there.*ad hominem* is probably the biggest offender when it comes to incorrect accusations, whereas the fallacy of composition is hardly ever used incorrectly in comparison. In my experience anyway.
Why would it make a difference? Wouldn't an argument like that require some kind of very tangible proof - *extraordinary evidence requires extraordinary proof*, or something along those lines. I don't understand what makes ad hominem fallacies an "excellent" heuristic in this case? without any proof you wouldn't be the wiser about aliens, wether its Neil De Grasse Tyson or someone else who told you about them.     How do you judge whose claims to take seriously and whose to reject? 
That's not true. If a person exists who is 100% wrong about everything (and you know this with 100% certainty), and you use that as your reason why we shouldn't listen to that person, then it's valid.It's more about relevance, here. If my attack on you pertains directly to the argument at hand, then it's not fallacious reasoning.
I watched for 6 minutes and all he said was common sense (which's what summed), so I don't know.
No. I'm tired and don't feel like getting into big reddit convos. This is also a sub for intelligent discussion, and I'll probably make myself look like an idiot(I am much better at physics and history than I am at articulating my political beliefs). Hell, I'm watching a movie and I've spent like, 50 minutes waiting to hit "add comment" because I keep getting distracted. 
Well when communication breaks down, and one side of the debate explains a concept in layman's terms, but the other side responds with  'I won't even talk about that, the earth is 10,000 years old', a wall has been hit.  The topic of discussion is no longer center stage, and this other person's ego is.  Well insults have this way with egos....
Considering the responsibilities of the office that he has been elected to; those qualities are indeed relevant because he will ultimately be representing the same people he has shown contempt for time and time again. Ergo, calling him a racist, sexist bigot isn't an ad hominem when used in broader discussion about the election. However, if the discussion is about some specific aspect of his platform that has nothing to do with social policy, then it would become ad hominem.The election is over. Is there really any point in being belligerent and hostile to anyone who doesn't agree with you?
Not if you're trying to persuade your opponent. *Maybe* if your goal is to persuade the audience, but you have to be careful not to come off as a jackass yourself. 
So his record of "stupid decisions" might be worth examining before he's handed the launch codes? 
Ronald Reagan wasn't a wing nut.
I think these characteristics you suggest are not really common in presidents. Yes, they most certainly may act like they are these things. However, many times a certain degree of sociopathy or detachment is required to even reach the loftier positions of power.
Plato didn't have to deal with first past the post voting.
It is, but I think it's important to recognize that that's the nature of public rhetoric. It is not about truth- it is about holding up certain values to get others to assent to. Whether or not the rhetoric is responsible or whether his ethos (the "perceived character of the speaker" in rhetoric) is a positive or negative influence on the cultural climate is a whole other issue. 
I've realized from this comment and others that there's a distinction to be made between *moral* character traits and *effectiveness* character traits. The former are like respectfulness, compassion, valuing human life. The latter include maintaining a cool temper, making tough decisions, and being able to fake the former if you lack those traits genuinely. I'd amend my statement to say that *moral* character traits are not actually relevant to the role of president, but their image is, and *effectiveness* character traits are very relevant.
He's been an entertainer throughout his campaign. People were impressed by the braggadocio and the outrageousness, and he played up to that image. Clearly this was a campaign strategy.That kind of reality TV act might win votes, but he's a statesman now. It's not quite that "he's got what he wanted" - he *can't* carry on with that behaviour now.
Obviously not all of them do that, but that's how a large amount of people on the left were. People who supported Trump often hid it because they knew they'd be vilified. I can't really say the same about Clinton supporters. If anything, they behaved like it was a witchunt.
It leads to a lot of ad hominems.
>Perhaps. but my point is mainly that by the time Trump showed up It was already too late.Can you expand on that? Not sure what you mean.>Finding racism/sexism in everything is why trump exists.There are definitely people who quickly pull that out against an argument they don't like. I don't think that was the case with this election. A good deal of Trump's campaign was either explicitly, or pretty damn close to explicitly discriminatory. 
She put out a lot of detailed policy. She brought up policy in stump speeches and during debates. Sometimes, during the debates I thought she was getting too into the weeds with policy and people would get bored. I'm guessing other people thought this as wellThe media decided to spend a lot of time talking about emails instead - there was little she can do about that.
Can you elaborate on that? 
>There's only so long you can call your opponents racists, sexists and bigots without addressing their ideasNote that the person I was replying to separates policies into two groups. Ones that can be accused of being bigoted and ones that typically aren't. I mostly mean that I don't think Trump would've won without these policies/ideas, the ones that are commonly derided as those of a bigot, they're what attract most of his base.
They really aren't drowned out at all. Some people are so blinkered and hyperbolic that's all they focus on, doesn't mean those are the most prevelant discussions. There has been more than enough rarional discussion and reasoned shutdowns of Trump for anyine to have the necessary information to decide he's totally unfit for office. Sorry but there is absolutely no way you can pretend liberals don't talk about actual problems with Trump or in general... I mean they're frequently called 'progressives', for a reason.
Probably because a scarecrow is a literal strawman: something bullshit meant to distract and confuse. A fake person meant to cause certain winged pests to think a predator (human) is manning the field, but the predator never moves.
You're both mostly right!  Pointing out that someone is a hypocrite is an ad hominem only if it's argued that they're wrong *simply because* they're a hypocrite.  A hypocrite could be right!
Given that I believe there is an implied "instead" when considering evidence of character as opposed to evidence of fact, I don't think it can be an ad hominem if the fact of the matter to be proven is their character itself. There is no fallacy there: the logic follows all the way through.
Because most people respond with ad hominems, and no actual criticism to respond to... so what else can you do?
>'I disagree with you but your position is intelligent and deserves respect'.    #  If someone has a more intelligent argument should you not change your position rather than saying the above?  I doubt I would ever completely disagree with a well thought out argument.
The problem is when it is "turtles all the way down". If every argument is met with a new departure from reality, you won't make any headway, and most likely it isn't worth the effort. 
I agree, but not everyone views them as different things.
I see it as the traditional:1. Do Thing2. ????3. ProfitWhere 3 is the conclusion, 1 is the premise, 2 is the argument. Or I'd also say using logical fallacies is like writing 2 + 'IGNORE THIS PART, TRUST ME IT WORKS' = 5
Accusing people of committing fallacies they haven't committed is not a fallacy in itself? What is it exactly?
It would still be fallacious IMO it just wouldn't be wrong. Fallacies can be made in arguments with correct conclusions.If this hypothetical person is always wrong then there is something wrong with the argument that you can point out. You may know something is wrong because this person is making the argument, but saying it is wrong because this person must be wrong would still be a fallacy. Since you aren't pointing out a flaw in the argument.
> Appeals to authority are often valid, as when we tell someone to use a certain medicine because the doctor has prescribed it. But appeals to authority can be fallacious, as *when we cite those who have no special competence regarding the matter at hand.*Just wanted to share this because I wasn't too sure about the meaning at first.
Okay, thanks for the reply.
it means penis
Not everything is a projection...
The sacrifices I make to get a point across.
Ok. He's not an idiot. There, now you have all your work ahead of you to prove otherwise. 
My understanding is that an ad-hominem occurs when someone is said to be wrong because of some quality about them. When is such an inference not fallacious?
Oh you bet your tax dollars and freedom it is!
It's dangerous to assume that there is a better man inside him.  The American people voted for a certain man, that man is now our president.
While you are strictly correct, I think any reasonable examination of the practical implementation of identity politics would show that ad hominem attacks organically develop and quickly replace whatever original arguments that identity politics used at the start.
I imagine his point was that Trump's policies are glorious generalisations, cloaked in rhetoric."Build a Wall and make Mexico pay for it""How? What does it do? Why? Will it work? Where's your evidence?"And the answer: BUILD THE WALL!!!!Trump talks about "REPEAL AND REPLACE", but the specifics are non-existent. What will he replace it with? Who knows?He doesn't. "LOCK HER UP"For what? Why?It's all talk, and no thought.
I did get that impression, yes. Are they not?
>So you think we should be tolerant of people who are intolerant of the intolerant?We should be tolerant and receptive to even those ideas will find intolerant, as long as the intolerant aren't harming anyone (physical violence/fraud not "offensive" speech) This is true open-mindedness.
There are intelligent arguments to be made for America's role as the policemen of the world, as well as against. You likely agree with one side over the other. But that doesn't make the other side idiots or not worthy of your consideration. Their arguments still have merit, even if you feel yours outweigh it.
The comment you replied to is discussing only formal logic, so a very obviously false premise and very obviously true conclusion were chosen.
I don't think you understand what bankruptcy is exactly. Look up Chapter 11.
The correct answer
So according to you, the arguments presented in the debates were satisfactory?
Right. An authority's aggreement with a proposition just adds credibilty to it. It doesn't prove it.
Small penis? It gives me that kinda image.
It was a joke sorry lad :(
Agree, I think it's almost inevitable. People will say he turned out to be "just another politician" if he doesn't exercise his executive powers to magically fix everything, congress be damned.
I believe the author is progressive.
Well that is why they call it a fallacy. The important thing is to know you are doing it, and have the ability to step back and attack their issues when you can. 
The example being extreme doesn't make it less true in less extreme cases. If you don't put forward a sound argument, your discussion partner's position needn't be swayed
You mean Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code under which debtors file for bankruptcy?
Like a pin prick
One wouldn't, and if one isn't, of what relevance is an explanation of what ad hominems are?
Interesting. I still would have liked more solid arguments, but I guess it's an opinion piece.
Ad hominem fallacy is the basis behind character evidence being inadmissible in a court of law.  Some ad hominem arguments are fallacious.  Others are not.
It's proving your reasoning for disgarding the persons claim, if they have an argument in favour of their claim, you have to disprove that too.Also it's nicer, which you should consider a good thing.
No, that's now what I meant at all, I meant a different Chapter 11 that refers to bankrupcy. :)
Having a good vocabulary is your responsibility. 
Better arguments may be found in Haidt, et. al., I think.
>It's proving your reasoning for disgarding the persons claim  Your reasoning is flawed.  It's the whole point of this fallacy.  Being wrong 99 times in a row doesn't make the 100th time wrong.  
I don't think you understand what a vocabulary is exactly. Look it up.
Nice, I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommend!
Quite welcome!
To be fair,a lot of philosophical thought is pretty esoteric these days. And for the layman, even epistemology gets pretty tortuous the deeper into it you go. It's hard to do if you don't have a serious background in philosophy or a related field.
I think you overestimate most people's ability to admit and accept when they are wrong.  At least here in the US, it is embedded into our psyche that being wrong is not an option.  Fake it till you make it is a result of this.  But people are faking it so hard, that they've lost touch with reality, and truly believe that they've already made it when they haven't got a clue.
>the comments here can be good but the political articles certainly are not to be trustedAnd let me guess, you also trust twitter and facebook comments. Blaming the mass media and not anything else is why we are all fucked. Just like we saw a portion of the American population cry foul to the mass media but then believe some poorly written, not-sourced post from a fake news site created by European teenagers.
> Political Left implemented a Phylosophical / Scientific narrative that states your Feels are more important than what can be measuredCan you give examples of this?
Why do we need to reject nominalism (and what kind of nominalism)? Also, there are pretty much no Certasians around anymore, so it's basically rejected anyways.
No, it's a phenomena throughout the western world. In short, it's just yet another wave of reactionism.
to be frank many people still have considerable problems dealing with the is/ought distinction, which is as basic as it is important
Thank you. I cannot emphasize this enough. My dad kept drilling in me as a teen that "being wrong is not bad. In fact being wrong is good if you learn from it". As an adult I evolved that into "screw up quickly so your through put, quality and efficiency improve". We Americans suck at this in general and am happy I have a boss that gets this and doesn't get on you unless you repeat the same mistake. Sorry for the digression but if just one person can shed their guilty feelings when they make a mistake, I'll be glad I put this out on the big bulletin board. Thanks again for your post.
I think you're vastly overestimating the degree to which most people's life experience reflects your own. A lot of kids get the phrase "shut the hell up" thrown at them on a daily basis, but very few subtle causal analyses. And maybe the TV you're watching involves distinguishing the two, but "at least once in every show" is obviously not the case.More broadly - education is where people are supposed to learn those things that 'everyone knows'. That's the whole point of it. 
> but they're often wrong no, that doesn't make them wrong. It means in this case they were causal. If you say your argument is "I'm gonna cross this bridge because it's American thus it must be sound" and I say "some american bridges have collapsed before" and then you walk across and it doesn't collapse, you don't go "you were wrong" to me. I was not wrong. 
The logical fallacies seem like common sense when you see them in a course or book, described in clear terms with simple examples. But when they hit you along with all the complexities of real life, and they are endorsing your side of the debate, it's amazing how they can pass unnoticed.
> I think it would be way more beneficial to teach kids psychology from a young age. I think that sounds like a great idea to try on a few small groups of kids.  However, I think that some of the most happy and effective people focus their attention out into the world and not into their own minds.  I could imagine it leading to great cynicism, too.But I'd totally support a trial run!
Well it certainly wouldn't alleviate all of the ills and character flaws that plague mankind, not even close. Honestly my only hope would be that it improve the quality of conversation by giving people the tools needed.
Yes, i agree that a lack of philosophy isn't the only contributing factor, and i can only hypothesize as to what the long term effects on society would be. But when i think about all the possible subjects that are or could be taught in school, philosophy seems to be one of the most useful and relevant, yet it is almost 100% absent.
If philosophies existed in a vacuum, then nihilism would be neutral.  But they exist within the psychological realm of human motivations, and people who are amoral by nature tend to have an affinity for it.  
And yet the meat does walk and talk.  What a strange thing to arise from the void.  Perhaps the void is literally not there, so to speak.  :)
Pretty much.  Nazism can be thought of as the philosophical MRSA of the 1920s an 1930s, having probed and slinked its way into every crack of the German psyche's intellectual self-defense mechanisms. 
I agree.  I do think that the strengthening of reason outweighs the responsive strengthening of its enemies.But we must also understand that the horrors of an intellectualized tyrant are creative and deep while those of a mere barbarian are wide and shallow.  Philosophy is a bold and courageous thing, because you will find unsuspected nightmares (that you realize with dawning horror will be considered as beautiful dreams by monstrous people) in addition to the wonders and heights.
No, of course I dont mean I trust social media,  that's my point. Mr Higgins is right,  we do need to be more critical of what we're told.  By anybody.  I agree with you,  I think you just misunderstood me 
> No, fear of those not like us is history itself. I would say we are better at not fearing others now, than any time in the past.You think we're better at it now than in the late 90s?
I've got a family member who is a doctor who said that Trump needs to be elected because inflation was out of control. Which is just not true. But you need look no further than Ben Carson for public figures
xD Ah you have a very valid point there my friend. I suppose it would be more accurate to say, "From the vast majority of unbias observer's perspectives, objective truth does not seem to exist."
> of course there isGood argument. Let me give a counter-argument: Of course there isn't.
Depends. Are you David Hume? 
That's what makes Socrates and Plato so important. Before, people just went on the "makes sense to me" principle, which can result in people believing all sorts of stuff.Now those principles are embedded in our legal systems, and in our scientific institutes, and it's about time for them to go mainstream.
I read this when I was young, it's a great introduction to philosophy.
Had seen that somewhere else but had forgotten till now. CheersI assume you mean the school of life i.e. The development of emotional intelligence??
> But they exist within the psychological realm of human motivations, and people who are amoral by nature tend to have an affinity for it.Ok so please provide some sort of support for this notion. Just because most open nihilist that you've encountered have come across as "amoral" doesn't mean that those people by nature tend to have an affinity for it. I seriously shouldnt have to explain this in a sub intended for intellectual discourse and understanding of complex concepts. 
Garbage in garbage out. It's not a limit but an error. If I use the equation correctly the error should not occur.
Your mistake is to assume that the walking and talking isn't part of the void.
I'm no teacher either haha. My highest level for education is an incomplete MA in Religion.But that's just a book I recommend for everyone. I had my wife read it while we were dating...
I call it that because I read it when I was quite young & didn't actually realise how much it had to do with "real" philosophy at the time. 
yup, as well as some of Allen De bottom's books like the consolation of philosophy.
not sure if both of you are talking of the same thingOP seems to be saying people of an amoral nature are drawn towards NihlismIt seems to me you are questioning the notion that Nihlists are drawn toward amorality. If that is the case, you are kind of not really debating on the same point. If I am wrong, ignore me =)
I suppose I'm abusing the word nihilist when I mean "misosopher."
How can a thing be part of nothing?  That's gibberish.
you're obviously only volunteering there to get close to the food supply and poison all the homeless
I can only conclude that *he isn't looking very hard*.   
what do you mean by void and why do you assume the void is nothing? there's a lot of stuff happening in empty space.
Depends on the form of nihilism, doesn't it?
Not to drop physics into a philosophy conversation, but "empty" space is not empty.  There's no such thing as nothing in empirical science, and the concept doesn't really work in philosophy either.
Nihil means Nihil in the end. 
right, on this we agree. 
Right! They are not Siths...
A number of them seemed like "pure science policy".  All I can envision there is like almost extremist version of all science society.We need a science tempered society, one where scientific research and evidence isn't undermined, but instead brought to the discussion as one side of the argument...An it seems some people cash in all their chips into an all science, all empathy, or all business society... that's a bit terrifying.
Screw that, I'm a practicing scientist and I wish that a requirement for any BS in any science field was one semester of philosophy of science. There were enough contradictory "SCIENCE IS X" claims being spouted out today to make Popper cry.
Except the scientific definition of a theory is something that's supported by evidence. For example, evolution is "just a theory" but is universally accepted by scientists because of the mountain of evidence supporting it. In science, if something "shows no evidence or experiments" and " has to be taken on face value", it's not a theory.
Unless they're either god-like or basically Vulcans, let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Basically, for all we know, the aliens aren't perfect either.
Has Coke used public grants to produce research showing that drinking Coke is fine? Did that happen?
Exactly. I try to approach people who fear science the same as I would approach a tribe that lived without any contact to civilization. If you tell them their belief is false then you won't win them over, because it would destroy their whole worldview. I try to simply show them the benefits of science, but I introduce them slowly to it so I don't scare them away.
There are hundreds of marches happening across the globe
Actually political science is more opinion than rumour. Political theory is a totally different ballgame, much like philosophy. Indeed, it is philosophy.
Your deduction will only ever be as certain as the certainty of your premises.
One of my favorite signs at the Boston march was two-sided.  The one side said "Science is a double-edged sword", and the other said "Resist the siren call of techno-utopianism".
And? The accurate political narrative that science and scientific evidence is being ignored/suppressed by the Trump administration.
Don't get me wrong, as far as the question of whether policy should be based on evidence and we should fund science, I am 100% behind these marches and strongly pro-science.  (and not just because I'm on an NSF grant)It's just that some of the signs I saw were close to deifying science, and that weirds me out a bit.
Really? Where/When did this happen?
I appreciate that you actually referenced philosophers here :-)
I am not sure I would say that, or that I would claim to be able to measure and equate cultishness or danger, but I might say that, as far as my subjective evaluation, both science and religion are at their best when they are acting as instruments of humility.
To the extent that credentials can add context, I am theoretical neuroscientist.  I fucking love science, it is my life.  I deal with the limits of science and its unresolved philosophical issues on a fairly regular basis.  And so when I see signs advocating blind acceptance of results or techno-utopian viewpoints I feel like I can criticize because *this is my house*, so to speak.
You would think, right? But you should have heard some of the speeches given today. Perhaps nobody thinks science is "an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth", but it's certainly the case that some of them think *whatever it is they're calling science* is "an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth."
Cheers, brother.
> But it is supposed to be rigorous, like math and science.I'd go even further, philosophy  of science is there to define the rigour required for something to be even called a science.
Is this sarcasm. String theory is completely theoretical. 
>You cannot have a theory without evidence.That is demonstrably false, as evidenced by the history of science: there have been plenty of theories that lack corroborating evidence at the moment of their initial formulation.
That's and of-repeated statement, which is true and offensive for foreign relations... I disagree with a leader saying that... But he did recant it, and explained it away as a joke, so what should I believe now?The point of your reply seems to suggest I should believe Trump's statement, but should I only believe the original statement, and not his recantation? 
Because that's not what science is, that's what the OP is all about. Theory is not absolute. Everyone could be dead wrong about everything. It's a slippery slope of loose beliefs based on only what you've seen or heard instead of what you haven't.
> Political science is rumor, not truth You need to be able to read, hooman
"*The fully enlightened earth radiates euphoria triumphant.*"Seriously though, my feeble heart is calmed *just a bit* hearing that there are voices of reason present to temper the voices of Reason at the rally these days. 
I suppose there's some possibility within, but we'd have to go all "Plato's Republic" on this empathy/science society.Are bakers empathetic or scientific?
To treat politics as philosophy rather than science
I'm a bit confused when you say "[science] can't be countered". Scientific progress is made by continually questioning previous assumptions and beliefs and improving/disproving them.
Well, as I'm fond of saying, "stupid assholes come in all shapes and sizes."  In any group of any real size, you're going to have outliers that don't "get it."Making any kind of judgements based on the outliers is, to me, always problematic.
And the best scientists have been proven wrong by future scientists. Science is always evolving and what we think we know now can change tomorrow
the science fanboy syndrome is at least partially (if not entirely) the result of the way that it's presented to the world at large by a handful of science popularizers and advocates who seem to have the largest mindshare with the public
You're missing the point. Her argument was/is that the belief in science or the faith in science mirrors religious belief. She was not saying science is religion. She was saying the way scientists believe in the validity of science mirrored those who believe in religion. There is no comparison of the two or saying one was right/wrong. Anthropologists like to view and catalogue, they aren't philosophers. 
So you have faith in the methods of science to prove itself as truthful? You are missing the point of the message if you are comparing as above. Her point was the framework of belief was similar. 
I don't actually know too much, but I am doing a course on social philosophy, which generally follows the enlightenment and its consequences, and Horkheimer and Lyotard both came up there.
I'd have to actually be there to say otherwise, but are you *sure* they weren't called science something more like, "not an unbiased machine for generating proven absolute Truth, but a hell of a lot closer to being that than anything else we've got?"
Science as we know it today, is an epistemological method devised by philosophers during the early enlightenment, so I think it's safe to call science a product of philosophy
String theory is theoretical, that doesn't mean it's a scientific theory... it's not.
I think you should ignore what his statement was and focus on what his actual *policy* is.
sound scientific methodology can reach incorrect conclusions. or, in layman's terms: sometimes science is wrong. 
as humans that operate in 3 dimensions mentally, perception of a round earth is a fine 3-dimensional construct. the idea of  spacetime "ditch" is only really an analogy anyways, since we can't imagine 4-dimensional geometry properly 
"Belief" doesn't require or imply absolute certainty or rigidity tho. 
I'm thinking you don't really know how logic works, do you?
You mean not everyone is pulling for Brave New World to come about? I want my soma dammit
> realize that technology is simply practical knowledge. And like all knowledge, it is a tool that can be used responsibly or recklessly. I think I agree with you 100%, except I read the sign as advocating exactly what you said above.  Science is not a panacea, rather it is a tool that can help or harm us.  We need tools, but it is dangerous to assume that a tool will automatically fix everything.
I am all about evidence-based policy decisions, and agree with you that it's a really useful system.  But there were also people with signs literally claiming that science will solve intolerance and social inequality.Maybe one day it will, somehow, but betting everything on that hope seems to be leaving behind evidence-based policy, rather than embracing it.
Can't they be both?
Competing hypotheses, not theories.
What's the alternative?
I'm saying that if science is to be used as a rule, then once such "rule" is established, nothing else can counter scientific logic of course besides a more accurate scientific understanding. The post i replied to suggests that science can simply be brought to discussion to compliment other aspects but really science will trump all those other aspects and science will end up either being absolute or the authorities that adopted science as a ruling object will eventually denounce it. Those are the two pathways I see.
Which is why it's not really like religion. 
I'm talking about scientists though, I'm not a scientist but perhaps I am one in training but I'm careful not to pretend I know how to be a good scientist yet. I simply respect what those who are do. "Pop science" seems to neglect the scientific method most of the time a dos more closely related to politics to in my opinion.
That is why I dislike this politicization of science that is going on right now.  It's getting used in an Us vs Them way when in reality people on both sides of politics are anti science in large numbers.
If we're gonna have brain in a vat conversations, maybe, but if we go down that road why even bother with any explanations?
If the scientific method does not work, then humans cannot ever know anything.
Well in the interest of scientific non-committal, I'd be willing to drop my claim if faced with a factual rigorous analysis. I'm going off of my memory of my impressions after watching some of the DC speeches. But if the speakers' views were indeed as nuanced as you suggest, it sure didn't come across in their rhetoric.
That's a Western interpretation that ignores the importance of Arabs such as Ibn al-Haytham and pretty much all the classical mathematicians and scientists. People forget that Newton believed as much bullshit as he did actual science, we just remember him for the science, not the occult.The provenance of the scientific method is long and does not belong to one culture or time.
Tax cuts for the 0.1%?
Yes, I understand that but it is still the *best* methodology we have for understand the nature of the universe. If something is wrong in science, we can correct it but continuing to follow the scientific method. Otherwise, we simply have to say "I don't know" until we do. The problem we currently have here is people are dismissing things like evolution and climate change. There are certainly details still being worked out sure, but the core science is sound. 
Haha, okay. I was debating whether to add them; I didn't at the time since it looked a bit distracting, but I guess it's probably worth it for new visitors.As for the site ratings, I agree they're not at all objective measures (assuming that's what you were referring to). It's main purpose is more as a sorting tool, for quickly finding (roughly) the strongest arguments, rather than an evaluation of the truth of the statements.
>It is impossible to describe the truth.So is that an absolute statement of truth?
Its an abuse of the wore science. In most European countries it would be translated to "political studies". Because the word science has a definitions on itself that is nowhere closely related to political science.(Im a Mathematitian and an Engineer who does politics for a living. Because I did political studies after university and was good at it).
I don't think we're talking about the same thing.
I could use like 2 soma right now...   I mean... if you know a guy ;)
I would gladly live in the world of that book. 
Well, I hope you're right and that my interpretation is wrong. But when I see signs that admonish us to not pursue a "techno-utopia", I read "technology and GMOs and chemicals and toxins and everything artificial BAD, organic kale will save us!" And that makes me facepalm.
Well scientific data has the solutions to those problems already. The issue is applying that knowledge in the complexity of the world outside of a lab.
So when science said smoking was fine, putting smoking restrictions on age should have been illegal despite common sense. Then 40 years later we saw scientifically that smoking was harmful we saw what? 
You can forgive people for being skeptical.  The "women's march" proposed to speak for all women, yet they prevented right wing speakers from attending.  At the end of the day it was clearly an anti-trump march pretending to speak for an entire group.
> Which is why it's not really like religion. Maybe not for the scientists, but for many in the general public, it is. Also, just because it is always evolving (as the post you responded to stated), doesn't mean it isn't religion like. Even religions and their theology evolve over time and the experience of their adherents.
In that case we agree for the most part, though I would still say that scientists who pay only lip service to these ideals are probably at least as common as clergy who pay only lip service to their religion. We are all only human, after all.
No, this leads to the discussion of consciousness,which is ontologically distinct from matter (including the brain). 
Legitimate religion is based on legitimate scripture, which is an authority on God. It is not based on empiricism. One accepts an authorized text and practices the process in order to experience it. It is top down, not bottom up approach. Like someone else said, epistemology is something that needs to be taught. 
>Calling something a social construct implies that it's not real: that it is born of instinctive human behaviorsSo it's not real, and yet borne of something...You're making zero sense, let alone getting close to what people mean by a social construct.
none of this has anything to do with the original question which was "when has science been wrong recently". 
Yes, but that statement has no effect on reality. It could have never been said. 
>political science> n.    The study of the processes, principles, and structure of government and of political institutions; politics.
Your point may be valid, but I think the reason you're getting downvotes is because of your use of the term "political science" in describing something that is not what political science is, which is the study of systems of government and the analysis of political thoughts, practices, and behaviors. It is a respected branch of the social sciences. I was being sarcastic in my comment above, just poking fun at misunderstanding.
False dichotomy.
The other commenter said:>it is true but you cannot prove it.I said:>that does not mean you can't prove those things using more powerful mathematical theories.
Could you point me to some sources on these solutions, even in a lab environment?
A more accurate scientific understanding. But at the time, we already knew what smoke particles alone could do to lungs, so it's safe to say there was a bit of propaganda and dissonance going on. That's actually what I'm talking about. Science was forgone to promote a notion that smoking is okay so we could make that sweet sweet GDP.
The purpose of the example was to illustrate science dominance when it's accepted as policy, go back to the post I replied to.
I'm not, just sharing my two cents. 
That's something you need to argue for.
but if you are reading that scripture or hearing it then how do you know your senses are reporting that information to your brain correctly. You are suffering from the same filters that you say people collecting data are experiencing. Even if you believe God is beaming that info directly into your brain there is nothing saying that signal is not being corrupted some how. You sufferer the same inability to be able to prove the signals your brain is receiving are true whether you are religious or a scientist.   
That is an important distinction to be sure, but then in turn those more powerful mathematical theories rest on unprovable assumptions as well, correct? Which can in turn be proven by more powerful assumptions, etc. But if that chain continues all the way up, then at some point does his point because a highly simplified but overall correct statement?
Social inequality can be solved by legislating equality. Such as anonymising resumes for employment and etc. along with a universal welfare like minimum wage, education, and healthcare.The problem isn't figuring out a solution. It's convinving people to implement the policies. Culture and politics get in the way of calculated progress.
>You are impliying that anything can be proven, the problem is to find the right theory to do so.More precisely: I am saying that given any precisely defined logical formula, there is a formal system that has that formula as one of its theorems. As you said, "the problem" is finding the right theory to do so---let's modify that to say that "the problem" is actually finding a single theory that can prove *all* mathematical truths. As the incompleteness theorems tell us, no such theory exists that is consistent, complete, and has other nice properties we would want in a theory of mathematics.
I mean, that's kind of what the human brain is.  
You wouldn't be a player you'd be an npc 
I remember when I was in primary 2 at school (Not sure of the US equivalent but age wise 5-6) I felt like I was still too little to be a 'big' P2, but felt like I was too 'big' to still be a P1. Kid logic brought me to the conclusion that the only explanation was that I must be dreaming and it's actually the summer break between both years. 
Maybe you have a shit brain.
yea my life seems like it would be pretty boring to be simulating. 
keen reference
Haven't you heard the news? It's made by the universe.Jk, we use Sparkol's Video Scribe. It's a fantastic program.
It doesn't really matter since we are all in a turtle's dream in outer space. 
Nope. Certainly there are epistemological issues with trusting the brain. But there are also questions about whether we can trust our "inputs" to the brain. Like the brain in vat connected to a computer that generates our world. In such a situation, how can we prove that we aren't just a brain in a vat? We really can't and hence our "knowledge" isn't real. 
Humans are adept at making patterns fit where none actually do. They want reality to fit into a nice little box rather than the chaotic fucked up mess that it is. Personally, I like the idea of a simulated universe because it conveys an order to things, but that doesn't mean that I believe it is true. The most horrifying realization I think people can make is that there is no order to it, that we're rudderless.
You cannot ascertain that you know that you do not know, you either know that you know  or don't know that you don't knowKnow knot known 
so you've taken acid too?
Thats because you compare it to being awake and any deviation from the norm shows them they are dreaming, eg having six fingers, not being able to read, etc. If you were in a lucid dream from the day you were born you wouldn't know any different as you have nothing to compare it to. 
I agree with this for the most part. I consider myself a strong "believer" in an argument and sometimes I ponder whether I just want to believe in "god" but maybe I consider "too cool/intelligent (to paraphrase) for mainstream organized religion 
How can a computer program threaten you? 
I had this thought as well.Although I didn't know anyone who has ever said something like that so far, it does seem like the most logical conclusion one can draw from thinking. I guess most people just don't think enough...
I agree. When tehy said the phrase "knowledge is impossible for humans" i sort of cringed. A better phrase is "everything is basically unknowable." or "its impossible to know anything with absolute certainty"
Stuck the landing.
Presumably it is only more "real" in so far as you believe it is a memory of an actual event in the "real" world.  This was the idea behind gifting replicants 'false' memories in Blade Runner.
What if this is a new experiment that doctors are trying, and sending text into my brain to actually try and wake me up from my "coma'..... Hmm
She doesn't know, that's kind of the point. If you look at everything through a sceptic lense you realize that there is nothing you can know with certainty. Additionally, if you don't know whether or not it is possible to know something for certain, you are still unable to know with certainty.
Well, it's not a rock.
Falsifiability and Occam's razor are two different things. Falsifiability is an appropriate requirement of scientific theories, but not philosophical ones. What is your justification for believing in Occam's razor? Why is simplicity necessarily a virtue?
Who would be a player then ? The rich and famous? Winners of Darwin Awards? Or would it be like CIV where the players decide the larger decisions?Either way, I would play those games. 
Until you wake up.
True but the points I'm trying to make are, that doesn't make the world we live in any less real, and that is a less likely scenario than this all just being real. It's not impossible that someone could smash my jar, but it's unlikely and practically unimportant. 
Those surveys that ask "are you afraid of dying" I always think: I'm afraid I'm already dead and just didn't quite get the memo. I always picture being dead as being asleep so I have these terror moments where I worry I'm really just dead, despite the fact that I don't believe I'd be capable of any thought after death.
This is basically why I was wondering, I feel like being exposed to it as a child has made me more susceptible to instability. Take care of yourself!! 
It's not the extraordinary ants that give biologists the best data on ant colonies, it's the boring mundane ants.
I skipped to the end halfway through to make sure I wasn't reading long post from that novelty account that ends every post with a reference to WWF Hell in a Cell and spoiled the joke.... :(
Other people are like this is so insightful and I'm over here like this is some false equivalency bullshit with a smattering (or a ton) of other fallacies and assumptions.  Total bs
I found it, thanks for replying. 
But where did the universe that created the turtle come from? It can't be turtles all the way down since it would have to be turtles all the way around in an infinite loop and that defies all known laws of logic (and I find that unlikely that those kind of laws of logic don't exist in every dream universe or whatever but ours)
The more you learn, the less you know
I am aware of this sentiment but do you actually switch "ignorance" on and off based on what situation you find yourself? Do you always live in a non-ignorant world? I feel like your response needs more application to the real world.
I get the joke, and I've never studied philosophy formally besides a couple of courses, but I'd argue someone like that is much more "involved with the world" than most other people. Ever since I've made the switch to white collar work, it seems like there are disproportionately more people in this type of work that aren't "living in the real world" for current lack of a better phrase. Most of these people just work and go do things at home, seeming to forget that there is a world that exists outside of their jobs and mortgages. 
How does it matter for us where the signals come in to the brain from? If we agree that its the brain that is the centre of consciousness, our scope ends there only. Talking about *who/what* factors control the brain, in that sense, is a separate topic.
Is there any reason to believe it isn't? For example, consciousness existing without a brain?
then *simulated universe* is just the latest costume for God.
ya op u friggin poopyhead
*head explodes*
I've had similar thoughts and I was only on cannabis at the time.
I'd say I get "okay" backlash for using the word *Anti-Dogmatic Theist* in front of the family. Works for me. 
Yeah but isn't that how many fields of inquiry go? Whether the universe is made up of multi-dimensional strings or whether or not the Poincare conjecture has a solution doesn't change the price of bread the next morning. It is still importnat, however in terms of understanding the universe or jist understanding the limits  of what we can know.
Nope. But through epistemology, you can create a view of the world that underpins science as a valid method.
You can't use science to prove or dispel that which deals with the validity of science itself as a method of knowing about the world. It's not just fun. It's the only real way to prove science is in any way more valid than a random person's opinion, which is what most political opinions are based on at the moment.
I can tell that I'm not dreaming considering the details, the sensations and the free will. If you can't tell, you are either in a coma, high or having issues with reality (a teenager thing). When dreaming, you wake up if you realize it. I've heard of people dreaming will being aware, but if it's true, that require training, and I never did that. 
Didn't it turn out to just be on turtle swimming through space, occasionally running across other disk-bearing turtles for disk-bearing turtle space sex?
This is idiotically reductionist
Coincidence sounds a bit flippant.  Maybe it's just the natural order of the universe to create life.  Like Alan Watts said "You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing."
>this is the kind of logic used by the faithful, and philosophy is kind of the antithesis to faith is it not?No, it's not. Every argument other than 'I think therefore I  am' requires some amount of faith in *something*.For example, discussing whether you could be a brain in a jar requires some amount of faith that it is even a worthwhile discussion to be had.Another example: Posting anything on Reddit requires faith that there are other sentient beings that will read it, instead of just advanced bots generating human sounding replies.
Like when Dwight's second life character developed Second Second Life
Well no, but it's not made of magic either.  It's just carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc.
True, you have to be careful with that maxim lest Occam's Razor becomes Maslow's Hammer.
Occams Razor is fake, it's just a lazy crutch used when people don't know the answer to something but still want to appear intelligent
That word has meant so many different things to so many different people that that question is meaningless.
They've got really good texture streaming. I haven't encountered any texture pop-in yet.
Fair point.
That doesn't sound like a view anyone should be remotely interested in holding.
One issue here is that most of the times you take stupid shit for granted in your dreams; it can feel like things are logical.It might be a bit far fetched, but it's totally possible that our sense of logic is made up by our brains. Our brains can produce hormones that make us feel like we found a pattern, even though we did not.
Well you woke up from every dream. Maybe you never woke up and everything seems right and logical as it should be, though we know dreams can make us convinced it is right logical when it is not.
Same here. Tripping doesn't help, what's weird is that I may have died several times! But yeah always thought this was Sim earth theory. Matrix and The Sims did a good job planting this in my head also.
It really creeps me out that I've never had a dream character accept their reality in my lucid dreams. No matter how much evidence I show them, they just won't accept that it's a dream. It worries me that I too could be a dream character in a simulated world.
Nah, we're simulating consumption, as long as you aren't self sufficient
What. I know Mumbai has a population. I know there's people in it. But I know that I've not seen its current exact population, therefore I know that I don't know Mumbai's population. Sure I can guess. But I know that I don't know it exactly, and certainly.

> nothing could've prepared me for that finale though.  -Excerpt from my amazing review
Seriously.  Are that many people not picking up that he's completely discrediting the very concept of knowledge while simultaneously basing his entire argument on information that *falls into the exact concept he's decrying*?It's flowery, but it's still BS.  Say a bunch of stuff that seems deep and reap the upvotes, doesn't matter if it makes any logical sense.
In my opinion, Pascal's Wager sort of falls apart when more than one religion is considered. If you were to really subscribe to the "better safe than sorry" reasoning of Pascal's wager, you'd need to be devoutly subscribed to every single religion- which doesn't really work.
Maybe it is impossible to live in a completely ignorant world, if Mazlow's pyramid should be considered, since autorealization drives people to further an interest constantly.
Apparently celestial teapots are quite real to some.
There are arguments for the externalized nature of consciousness, as well as for the fact that consciousness is specialized throughout bodyparts. Actually, I think any view that consciousness is 100% internal in the brain is probably somewhat against the grain at this point.
Essentially. It gives comfort where no explanation is possible and fills the same role as the god of the gaps. It's unknowable and unprovable either way. 
Haha may have to borrow that term 
You never had a dream that felt so real that you at first weren't sure if it actually happened, even after waking up? I have, about 10-15 times in my life, but there are people who experience this much more often. I've also had dreams where i was aware (lucid dreaming), but only twice. It can happen even without training, it's just not that common. Besides, while in the dream doesn't it feel real? If it doesn't, that would mean you to some exrent are aware of dreaming.
great series i'm on book 7
True but that's not its purpose. It is meant purely to demonstrate the skeptic's position.
Or just reductionist and you don't like that.
It's just a reaaaally lucky combo of the same shit that the entire planet and everything we *know* is made of. 
I don't think it's reasonable or justified to believe a rock can think in the same way a brain does, until someone demonstrates that rock-like things can think like a brain does.A thinking rock is kind of incompatible with reality.
I agree with your main point though of it not really mattering for our day to day lives. Assuming we're living in a simulation, why should that affect me? How does that change anything? Life is likely just as meaningful or meaningless (depending on your thoughts) with or without that knowledge.
>It might be a bit far fetched, but it's totally possible that our sense of logic is made up by our brains.Not enough people consider this.
Yes, its self refuting like all foundational beliefs founded on skepticism, but at least it makes you feel fuzzy. 
I'm still not sure I'm just the only one not in the joke or something.  I read half of it and was like this is nonsense but then I saw the comment score and thought maybe its good joke everyone else figured out faster than I. LIke...............
I think you're right that neuroscientists would agree that the body plays an important role in consciousness and that we should stop considering the brain as a disparate piece of hardware. But not many credible ones would say that consciousness exists outside, or after, the body and brain.
I wake up everytime it feels real. I tend to be very skeptical (irony), maybe it's in my nature. Not everyone dream the same way. And I usually work a lot at night, which kinda fuck my dreams too. Once I get to sleep on a normal cycle I tend to have terrible nights, but I can count with my fingers the number of dream that I have memories of, and even less for the one that felt real.Dreaming and not being able to tell if it's real is not the same as being awake and not being able to tell if you are sleeping or not.
What order are you reading them? In order of release? I kind of just read them all randomly except for direct sequels like the colour of magic and stuff. 
And the above reasoning demonstrates the futility of the skeptic's position. It has zero philosophical or intellectual merit. 
Agreed.  Or at least that's what my rock wants me to think.
I think it would certainly impact how people view death. Opens up the real possibility of an afterlife. Along the same lines of if you could prove God was real. 
That in essence we can't trust something because it sounds logical to us. Even repeated occurences like stones falling to the ground when thrown could just be our minds making us believe there is a connection with the weight / gravity. Just some random thoughts in combination with us 'feeling like we understand' is what we experience in dreams too. It might happen in our waking state too, possibly all the time.This is not entirely practical, but it is certainly a possibility if you throw all your daily assumptions out the window.
I'm also very skeptical, about most things. Before i had those dreams i likely would have doubted how real it can feel. For sure, i've never had a recurring dream and feel a bit skeptical about them. Is there someting else you can think of with the possibility to make you think you were doing something, when you really weren't? Psychosis, delirium, drugs, or a coma (as you mentioned)? If no, do you think it is possible that you actually exist in a simulation (simulation theory)? 
yeah, but we don't know how the universe outside the simulation works, maybe things can pop into existence, and we're a research project on say, an oddball idea like conservation of mass.
In todays news: the human brain declares the human brain to be natures most impressive creation. 
We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. 
This has been dissected thoroughly above. My ego says it's lucky because I enjoy being alive?I've begun to question everything I am since joining this thread today. 
That is actually a very good point I hadn't considered. In a way, I guess the makers of the simulation would be, for all intents and purposes, God.
Is that ego or just a machine working properly? 
There is no such thing as death, life is just a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves......here's Tom with the weather.
And they can make death whatever they wanted. Another simulation, or nothing at all. Might be the real test. If you are conscious after you die, it's a simulation. 
My inclination is ego. We're only so impressed because we don't fully understand the brain.
I just watched Revelations (1993) by Bill Hicks. Holy shit. 
We're all only pretending to be self-aware? Thank goodness! I thought I was the only one!
Just watched Bill Hicks in Revelations for the first time and holy shit that's a genius. 
But also because there is nothing we have observed that is equally compelling. I don't think it's an ego thing.
He's something else. It's a shame he didn't make it to older age like Carlin. I would have loved to see how he evolved.
Yep. Maynard from tool is a big fan of that guy. His stuff pops up in a few of their songs. 
YES, I LOVE PRETENDING THAT I AM SELF AWARE AND NOT JUST FOLLOWING MY CODE
For the hidden stash folder deep in your computer called "totallynotporn"
Actually, I was just quoting the song in the link I commented above. 
I agree with that analysis (I.e., that the bias fallacy is a form of ad hominem). In my experience many people who know what an ad hominem fallacy is do not seem to recognize that the bias fallacy is an instance of it. Perhaps I'll add that point. (Or you can in the comments if you prefer).
Would an entirely apathetic person still be biased though? I mean prior biases could exist but if they really didn't care about whatever those biases pertained to could they really be said to have a bias at all? 
Watched that movie last night. I didn't walk in with any expectations but it was a great film
Ahhh, but that's a fallacy. You're so wrong!
Both trial lawyers are biased, but it would be wrong to ignore both of them. It would be wrong to ignore only one of them. 
There is subjective and objective truth. Society goes reckless with subjective lies so subjective truth gets a bad rap to the point where people don't believe it exists at all. 
The post features a couple instances of people saying things like that.
yup. its not that a biased person is more likely to be wrong, its that a biased person is more likely to have constructed their argument based on their biases and (possibly/often/potentialy) ignoring details not fitting, in line with their biases.If a media outlet with an anti immigration bias reports on any and all instance of crime committed by immigrants, its not that they are wrong about the crimes committed, they just have certain reasons for why they call attention to this.
The evidence *and* the logical inferences we make from the evidence. But yeah.
>Whike they may not always necessarily be wrong, them being biased is a legitimate reason to be skeptical of their argument.You should always be skeptical of an argument at first.
Correlation, in the majority of cases isn't accompanied by causation ;-) so I don't know how about your claim.  You can find Correlation very easily between totally unrelated things while a causal dependency must be proven. 
Next Up on philosophy for dummies: Why logically valid arguments are important.
Not would...might.Again, bias makes it less likely than an opinion is correct, but it doesn't preclude the opinion being correct.
That's another way to put it. Thanks!
You mean, you're not connected to all your high school friends on Facebook? What else is Facebook for other than passive-aggressively sharing stuff like this on Facebook? ;)
But the latter case depends on whether the bias is relevant to what they are saying. E.g., if they are simply stating a fact, then their bias doesn't *necessarily* matter. E.g., "They're biased (toward a Keynesian view of economics) so their claim (that the unemployment rate is what the BLS says it is) is unreliable" might still be fallacious. It's not clear that being biased towards Keynesian economic theory bears on whether the BLS is reporting accurate unemployment numbers. 
Exactly. The doctor who tells you to lose weight while being overweight himself; he's a hypocrite, but he's not wrong. If the doctor tells you to take some drug, and he's been funded by the drug manufacturer, he's very biased, but *it still may be the best drug for you*. Bias and hypocrisy increase the probability someone's opinion may be wrong, but it is not evidence by itself.
Sure, we should only *conclusively* dismiss an argument if it can be demonstrated to be wrong, but it is perfectly reasonable to never entertain it in the first place if there's not a reasonably reliable source for it. I'm sorry, but not only is somebody citing Breitbart not going to convince me, it's going to make me think less of them as a person and all their other arguments as well. 
But even if a source is biased, it doesn't *necessarily* follow that all of their claims are false.
Have you ever met an unbiased person? I'm not going to bother getting into a conversation about something I don't care about..
I so badly want that to be true.
That or ad hominem. It attacks the person and not the argument.
No it doesn't. 
Also true.
Agreed. That's actually pretty close to what I say in section 5.
Not necessarily. Section 3 explains.
But not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases improve accuracy.
It's related. Yes.It might be be a genetic fallacy or an ad hominem fallacy. And some have pointed out (in the Reddit comments) that it could actually be a formal fallacy.
Fair point. But we should keep in mind that not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases *improve* accuracy. 
Sounds like you're assuming that all biases decrease accuracy. That's not the case. Some biases improve accuracy. Section 3 explains.
Sounds like you're assuming that all biases decrease accuracy. That's not the case. Some biases improve accuracy. Section 3 explains.

Let's grant that it's a *subset* of ad hominem. Just because one thing is a subset of another thing doesn't mean that the subset doesn't exist. 
Not necessarily. Some biases actually improve accuracy.
That or a genetic fallacy. And some have pointed out (in the Reddit comments) that it could actually be a formal fallacy. 
But not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases improve accuracy.
Not all biases skew that way. Some biases improve overall accuracy. Section 3 of the post explains.
I see your point, but even that that latter heuristic is, strictly speaking, fallacious. One can report something that conflicts with one's biases and still be wrong.The former heuristic is a bit better. Perhaps that's why you put it first.
Fair point. Withholding relevant facts is a bias that might make it more likely that one is wrong. But even that bias wouldn't *necessarily* result in being wrong. A fine distinction, but a distinction nonetheless.
But surely not all false claims *necessarily* imply bias. In principle an unbiased person (if there is such a thing), could make an error and thereby be wrong about something. 
Not necessarily. Section 3 explains.
And some biases can *improve* credibility. Section 3 of the post explains.
See section 3 of the linked post.
i would think it is more a subset of the fallacist's fallacy.  it relies less on their character and more on a particular error in their reasoning and inferring the falsehood of their conclusion.    there is a lot of overlap between identifiable fallacies, but this would seem to be a formal fallacy where ad hominem is not.
I wouldn't mind using formal arguments every day. I'd enjoy interacting with people so much more, and we'd all benefit from the intellectual stimulation. Fuck it, from now on whenever someone is about to raise their voice at me, I'm just going to go gather evidence to support my premise and wait until they are done to present it. Suddenly every argument lasts two weeks and I win by attrition.
If calling someone biased is the same as saying that their argument has a flaw in reasoning, it is essentially the fallacy fallacy unless you can also say what that flaw is.
Is that the right position to have?
It's true that recognizing and pointing out a bias is not a fallacy in and if itself. But when it's used in an argument that has nothing to do with a person's biases, then that argument is made "to the man" rather than addressing the actual issues.
Yes. A lot of bias is the result of heuristics, our brains just trying to minimize the energy used to think about something by oversimplifying it. An entirely apathetic person hypothetically wouldn't care enough to put in the extra time and energy to get around this. They would just default to either the intuitively best sounding answer, or the answer closest to what they've been raised with.Arguably, Apathy toward the truth is as good a cause for bias as caring too much for what you feel should be true.
Yeah, that's true. But one might be forgiven for taking it that the interlocutor supplies that suppressed premise when they say 'I am free from bias!' Anyway, the example was a little tongue in cheek; I think these 'exceptions' can be generated for most fallacies.
If someone says 'I am not biased,' then it suffices as a refutation of their position to point out that they are.
> The problem is when people act like suspicion is enough to deny their claims without even checking the evidence.For sure, this is always a problem in any context. If one doesn't even attempt to see the other side (or "steel man" arguments), then not much progress can be made and people will just talk past each other. 
> Everyone is biased, not sure why this should be particularly notable.For context, and to avoid other common pitfalls in logic. If someone falls on a particular end of the political spectrum their claims about political ideas should be taken with their bias in mind (and thus note information that may be omitted or distorted by a particular perspective). > that doesn't mean they should be dismissed without any consideration.I can't think of any good reason to dismiss anything without consideration. 
yes, been waiting to see someone pointing this out
I don't think he's disagreeing with that, he's saying there is further reason to be suspicious (beyond the usual amount) if you can clearly tell someone is biased towards the subject at hand.
Not to mention that "truth" is finite, if one is willing to pretend that they understand what is true and what is not. 
So you're talking about what authorities we trust. Just expanding on what I said right?
I have never heard of anyone seriously say that bias indicates truth of a claim. This is a total straw man. 
Exactly. And when CNN breathlessly clutches its pearls that a Republican referred to slaves as "immigrants", yet they didn't object even once when the 44th President did it no fewer than 11 times between 2008-2016, there is a certain reason why they don't call attention to that.
Good point
I meant this case specifically 
I don't know if it increases the probability of an opinion being wrong. 
I question your claim there about moral bankruptcy. The last I checked, jihadists are quite honest about their intentions, for example. It would be better if they were hypocrites & talked the talk without walking the walk (& better still if they were good people, of course). 
But there is a high chance that they are altering the truth to push their agenda.
Feel free to explain why.
If someone is objectively right, they're not biased by definition, no?So the further away you are from objectively right, the more likely you are to be wrong. Also, you become exponentially more likely to be wrong the more biased you are. Which is why MSNBC is still a legitimate news source, but Breitbart News is not.
Nope, not assuming bias always decreases accuracy, just that it changes interpretation, which always negatively impacts confidence in the findings. Bias is a disturbance factor, positive or negative, so it's always going to affect confidence. 
eh... You've tried to make it a fallacy in and of itself. Too much rhetoric surrounds the notion of bias or perceived bias to "call it the bias fallacy"
How ? To me if you ignore half of a picture. You only see half of the picture 
Heh thanks but I guess it's useful to a lot of redditors so I guess it's a good thing you posted it :)
That's true, but generally speaking when we are evaluating pesonal qualities we don't label positive bias, only negative.(Case in point: linguistic bias of contextual convention without which communication would be so inefficient as to be nearly useless)
I do think that this is how bias is used negatively more than outright lies though. It seems to me that biased sources, whether they be left or right, tend to only tell one side of the story. And if this is how a lot of people get their "news", they often only get half the story.
While we're on the subject of the fallacist's fallacy and ad hominem, I have noticed that most people misinterpret what ad hominem really is; that is, any uncivil comments in the course of an argument are hailed as "ad hominem!" and the entire argument is dismissed out-of-hand.There is an enormous difference between "you are wrong, therefore you are stupid" and "you are stupid, therefore you are wrong." Only one is an example of ad hominem. The other is just a lack of decorum, which says nothing about the logical validity of the argument.
You can't say 'someone lies, therefore this that they said is also a lie' but you CAN say 'someone lies, therefore this thing that they said should deserve greater scrutiny'.To expand on a common proverb, 'A broken clock is right twice a day, but it's still a broken clock and needs fixing.'
Logically valid arguments can be biased. E.g., 1. All Democrats are _________2. So-and-so is a Democrat.C: So-and-so is _________. The first premise could be the result of a bias against Democrats. But the conclusion could still be true (even if the first premise is false). And the argument is valid even if the first premise is false.So the mere existence of a bias doesn't necessarily invalidate an argument or it's conclusion. 
The fallacy fallacy! The fallacy of being wrong. I like that.
Fair enough, but when that bias is a direct cause of an error, pointing out the bias still isn't an ad hominem.  Bias commonly causes errors (for example, in investigations) so it must be guarded against.  
Great point. It's the opposite end a the same spectrum.
Exactly. I don't have to be aware of my liver for it to be there. It's just plain immature to insist you don't have a bias. You can say you're going against your bias, but you can't say it's not there.It's just that most people have been raised to believe they are PURELY rational creatures, which is a hoot by itself. So now they gotta own up to their very hypocritical stance that they don't ever get emotional...they do...we all do lol.
I am not biased. The president of the US is Donald Trump. Does it render my point moot if I'm secretely against/for Trump? No. Facts are facts, independent from the one who states them.
unfortunately this is what happens most of the time - people just talking over one another, or just waiting for their turn to talk.
> I can't think of any good reason to dismiss anything without considerationIt's a repetition of something that has been dismissed with consideration?
I agree with you that we pick and choose authorities to listen to.But the way in which we choose the authorities we pay attention to is not free from error. In the context of a discussion about how people commit fallacies, it seemed appropriate.
I first heard it when studying philosophy of science. I heard it again when studying statistics. Selective observation is a bias. It's also part of good science. Biased estimators are often more useful than neutral ones. So they're still used in many statistical analyses.So if this is a straw man, then the straw man is real. I'm not just making it up.
It depends on the bias and the inquiry. This is explained in point 3 in the post.
"Cannot infer from one to the other" means exactly the same thing as "cannot necessarily infer from one to the other" except in one you're trying to backtrack before you even post. 
Perhaps. But I've thought the same thing about some redditors. And let's be real: I did post *my own blog*. Even if that's somehow not an ass thing to to, it is kind of attention-seeking. ;)
Someone can be significantly biased and objectively right. Again, section 3.
Hmm. Can you quote the part where I claimed that the bias fallacy could not be a subset of another class of fallacies? I think I'm missing it.
Section 3 of the post explains.
I'm making a distinction between a set and a subset. 
I don't know if that's the case. I think the reason this is done is that the credibility of a controversial argument is reinforced when an antagonistic source supports that argument. :
The "gentlemans agreement" that the TV stations get to use the ***public*** airwaves for profit if they report the news  is over.News is now supposed to generate a profit like every other program these corporations air.
No, but I'm not sure you can deny that the number of anonymous sources is much higher than it used to be. "Leaks" are much more likely to happen in a digital age.
I agree. However, many times people will use personal attacks multiple times in their arguments- not explicitly saying "x is wrong because you are stupid". But rather trying to cut away at your credibility and therfore your position. I argue that while personal attacks have not effect on the validity of an argument they only serve to weaken the position of the one using them. They are divisive and serve only to be inflammatory. It becomes less about well thought out discourse and more about how many digs you can get it.
What if you know the institution or individual as a goal of getting you to view a situation in a negative light? At what point do they become discredited. Surly you wouldn't trust a nazie to give you a truth, so I imagine somewhere before nazie you begin to mistrust a source.
> They're biased, so they're wrong!There is no calling out flaws in reasoning with this statement. Following your definition, all it does is say that they have a flaw in reasoning.If you mean to say that this statement should be followed up with an explanation and well thought out argument for why it is so, then yes, but the same could be said about most fallacies. The same would be true if it were an ad hominem instead a flaw in reasoning.
If your point is 'I am not biased,' and you are, then your point is not 'moot,' but is instead, strictly speaking, false.
In that case, you aren't dismissing without consideration.  You're dismissing because you considered it already.
I don't think they are saying it is false, just biased. 
Agreed. I don't know how we pick authorities, and I am not sure I agree fully with you in how most people pick authorities. Perhaps you can make a more compelling case for it?
I guess it's hard to say that there is a standard. But given historical, cultural and social context, I think it's still quite hard to logically justify White Superiority using the Bible by virtue of the fact that Jesus was Middle-Eastern and is depicted as the 'perfect man; God on Earth'. So on that basis alone (though obviously I'm not in any way committing to this point of view), Christianity should be all about Middle-Eastern supremacy if anything, hehehe! 
You've assumed I agreed with your original reply (which I didn't). You're arguing on premises I don't agree with.
That's fair enough but I don't think it should constitute a full post on a philosophy-based subreddit. Given the upvotes, I guess I'm wrong.
People are certainly much less likely to lie against their bias than for. Sure there is still the possibility of being wrong, but it won't be wrong because it was entirely fabricated or created to mislead.
Deep throat
And what is the point of your *also*? In the end the only contribution you've made is the phrase before it. And many people who simply disagree with you are less likely to take you seriously or engage you. It almost seems like a tactical decision: 'I'm going to make this point and then reduce the likelihood of a counterargument by being really ugly.' It's lazy, and a lack of decorum is synonymous with poor arguments in general. 
We trusted the Nazi's to help build the V5 rocket for the Apollo missions, so no I wouldn't say that any particular position should lead to outright distrust of everything.  They might be in the KKK but that doesn't mean they aren't right about the transmission in your pick-up truck.
Hmm. I guess I define biased as less likely to be true, in a coherent direction (so not just variance in truth). How do you define bias?
I agree that identifying trolls can be misused for ad hominem attacks, but I do not think it is always impossible. At least on the internet you can sometimes see if a person/robot/group of people has a history of behaving in a certain way and use that knowledge to judiciously conserve energy so it can be better spent discussing with people genuinely arguing their point instead of with "trolls" or "shills".
> Perhaps you can make a more compelling case for it?Perhaps I can. But what I wrote was meant as an offhand comment. I'm content to leave the topic without any further exploration.
I'm confused. I asked a question. I didn't give premises.
I don't know. Sometimes useless stuff gets upvoted. ;)
Things leak when there are people willing to leak. Disgruntled employees are the nightmare of large corporations, especially when they have dirty laundry they don't want aired. Convincing your underlings is a pretty necessary skill for managers.
> and a lack of decorum is synonymous with poor arguments in general.In a comment section about fallacious reasoning...
Google "learn formal logic" and it'll lead you a few places.
You cant call them Nazis just because they were German scientists 
The term justified true belief is indicative of 3 components:The justified part is in relation to how you deduced your reasoning and is it justified?The original argument was that you can't obtain knowledge if your justification is correct but the statement isn't true.However, you can luck out and coincidently have a truth although coincidental even if your justification made sense (i.e. Deductive reasoning) again, these are called gettier cases and are not representative of true knowledge.
Ok, that's fine. I was more interested in what you have to say than arguing with it, jsyk.
I didn't say hypocrisy was desirable or a virtue! I say a murderer who speaks against murder is less evil (in practice) than one who speaks in favor of it!
Haha, I don't think it's useless information in general, just that I didn't expect it'd get so much attention on a philosophy sub.
This.Where I live (Argentina) we are taught philosophy in highschool and we don't have a 'better society'
"I can't go to the bathroom or go on my phone whenever I want, so I'm not free"
Come to think of it, aristocracy is a *really* good idea!
Yup.Logic and critical thinking would be a much more helpful place to start.
Holy crap I didn't realize it was robotic at first. I spent 20 seconds trying to understand why they picked such a boring british voice actor to do this video.
There is in terms of making decisions, individual or legislative mandates/prohibitions. And the nature of production flows from those decisions.
This is really not true of a lot of schools. There are plenty of shitty high schools but the fact that you went to one doesn't mean everyone does. My high school was very open to discussion in most classes, I took several religious studies classes in high school and the majority of lecture time was spent in discussion.
I think regardless of what philosophy is being taught, the point of the class shouldn't be to have students adopt whatever ideas they're learning and rather examine them and make their own decisions. A good class on Marxism shouldn't produce a batch of Marxists
Not at all true in the US. Most students never have a class in philosophy even through college.
> Academia screwed philosophy.  How?
Can you give examples of this?
Today's conservatives, whose worldview demands simple non-negotiable realities and/or religious obedience, would find it threatening on an even deeper level. 
I'm Uruguayan so close enough. I believe our society is not as full of stupid people who went to school. Our stupid people didn't go to school. 
Yea I feel like having 15 year olds read biographies on Plato and Socrates is not the best way to go about it.
Uhm, tomorrow is Judaisms most important holiday and it's entirely about admitting your wrongdoings. Major take-away from any story about the prophets or kings is how they were wrong and made mistakes over and over. Not every religious person is incapable of questioning their own philisophy/belief system.
One of my HS teacher allowed us to go to bathroom whenever wanted, his thought process was that he wasn't gonna make us pee on the floor and how is he going to explain this to the dean/AP/counselor etc. (he prob had to go through this once in his career). Off topic I know sorry.
The reliance of going into historical aspect is part of the reason a lot of people find it so boring. The class should try to relate philosophical questions to everyday life rather than talk about ancient Greek bros at least for mandatory a high schools class
I'm not so sure, humanist ideas are REAL powerful and if you're going for the americas you should definitely get the exploration ones first.
Well the modern equivalent would be for our top politicians to be somewhat educated, if not by a school than through experience. Which we definitely require. Many people's gripe with Trump is that he simply wouldn't be able to govern, because he has no idea how a country, or indeed the international community, works. Judging by his comments on using Mexican import deficits to the US as funding for The Wall, he doesn't even understand how the market works. So i'd say Plato is still pretty up to date on the notion of philosopher kings. 
Teaching ~~education~~ in ~~American high~~ schools would make for a better ~~country~~ world. 
Symbolic Logic is introductory philosophy.I agree with u, but I think systems should start with a modern day Trivinium.
aw shucks us mericans don't have much need for all that book learnin anyways.  Jus gimme a can of cope cold buds and nascar an im just as happy as a pig in shit a derpa derp
and most philosophy classes suck unless you have a super motivated teacher. barely more interesting topics than in religion, the class you trade it in for. logic should be taught to everyone, most of philosophy should be optional. 
I agree, the basic concepts would be good to learn relatively early. I wonder, has there been any research into the best age for teaching logic/critical thinking as a course? Or into how it affects students over the long term?
Can confirm. School teaches finance don't know any other high schools that do.  
Except many parents are incompetent or don't care.  Then society has to deal with grown children that can't function within its parameters.  
Of course they don't, but teaching philosophy wouldn't create a society that does that IMO. 
It depends on the teacher/prof.  However, memorizing logical fallacies/thinking critically about a situation on one's own would do kids a lot of good just by themselves. 
It basically requires people who have a real handle on their own beliefs, as opposed to being "Master Parrot" in *The Pilgrim's Regress*.
You can't teach that with 100% efficiency, but you definitively can achieve something acceptable.. That's no mystery why some countries have so little offence rate: those may be the countries with the least immigration (AKA homogeneous education and culture) and generally low population or little space (less complex, less concurrency).
> One of my HS teacher allowed us to go to bathroom whenever wantedIs this not normal? Every teacher I've ever had let us go to the bathroom whenever we wanted. I live in Sweden.
Youu can do all of these things. Just not without consequences.
But talking about the history of the philosophers adds a lot of context to it. Because the guy from 800 BC has a lot less collective knowledge to build upon when he is doing his own writings. So talking about it for that context is important. I agree that it is pretty dumb to make it a quiz about ancient Greek dudes and who had what idea, but talking about when they were and providing a bit of context really goes a long way.
Wow there, I think educationin my HS(Portugal) was fine, like an 85/100 in teaching, only lacking resources for some more interactive learning. I didn't fully prepare me for college, but well enough.  (Woosh?)
> TriviniumWhat's that?
I'd argue engagement with the process is a more fundamental first step. Hard to get people to think critically if they have no interest in doing so to begin with.
Philosophy is its own topic (2-3 hours/week, compulsory), not an alternative to religion (1 hour/week, optional), at least where I grew up.
IIRC some cognitive abilities aren't developed enough at that age for them to understand many philosophical concepts due to abstract thinking limitations.Elementary seems way too early to me. 
It's a shame they quit teaching English.
Would it inhibit such a society? Assume for a moment that thinking doesn't preclude doing, something Americans instinctually believe.
You just explained it perfectly to me. Thank you.
This. All the time I see people committing logical fallacies, and mostly arguing to "win". I've been saying forever that history needs to be replaced with philosophy, or have the two classes molded into one, where it's less of "memorize these dates" and more of "this was our mistake, learn from it". 
what else should a 101 class be?
The same is true of any system of belief about anything. Anything that becomes the default "orthodoxy" within a community is going have people pushing back against alternative proposals. The universal triumph of atheism wouldn't do anything to change that.
Grammar, Logic and Rhetoric.First you have to learn tools to parse what people say. Then you learn the tools to find out if what they say makes sense. Then you must be able to express your ideas in a clear and persuasive way.
That makes sense, at least for any complex education about philosophy.
In our Internet age that wouldn't be a problem though.  I'm not suggesting an alternative, I'm just saying what I wish would've happened instead :pI do think that there *should* be mandatory philosophy classes, as it's designed to make people think differently and I think that's something we need both as a collective and individually.
Some men are in a cave all their life, chained so that all they ever see are shadow puppets on the wall infront of them. Suddenly one of them is released and when he stumbles out of the cave, discovers that the world is not just shadow puppets. He goes back to try and convince the others that their world isn't the real world, but they won't listen because all they have experienced is the puppet show.
Absolutely agreed.
I don't recall my history classes ever being about memorizing dates. It was much more about learning the broader strokes of what happened "What was the turning point in the war?" rather than "When was this battle?" and a lot of understanding causation in history, "What happened to Europe as a result of World War I?" rather than "When was the Treaty of Whatever signed?"
Atheism isn't really a philosophy, nor are all the discouraged questions about the existence of God. 
Which I find a bit humorous considering some of my greatest difficulty finding mutual terms has been with mates of mine who are philosophy teachers. We had to remind ourselves time and again that a disagreement doesn't necessarily mean we disagree on the actual content, but that our vocabulary lends itself towards different meanings. Me from the sciences, and my mates from the humanities. It's amazing how accurate the principles behind the Trivium really are. 
I think it's also important that Plato's ideal society was a society ruled by a "Philosopher king," a kind of enlightened monarch who was not only had awareness of philosophy, ethics, etc, but also the power to see that they were implemented within society. I think the Allegory of the Cave was his attempt at justifying such a society. Since those stuck in the cave will always have difficulty seeing beyond their perceptions, its the responsibility of those who are able to break away to lead the others.
Omg i was  born in 1981-i had no idea i was considered a millennial... I thought i was in the no man's land between Gen X and millennials
It's from antiquity. They were considered of a higher form because the trivium is, like they said, sort of what is necessary to interact with other thinking beings. The quadrivium is the ability to then think more critically or creatively.
That's why my blood boils when someone says "Meh, it's just semantics". SEMANTICS IS PRETTY FUCKING RELEVANT, BITCH.Sorry, I got carried away.
but if you lead the others they strike you down and murder you.
But it's in the quadrivium 
No, I agree. I have wasted too much breath arguing with people about something, only for us to realize at the end that we actually agreed all along and were using different meanings for our words. There is no perfect communication, but bloody hell I need to get better at my own.
Which is my personal biggest argument for democracy. Democracy as a system is so stupid to me. But you can't go against what the people want unless you want a revolution on your hands. Even if what you want is the greater good. (American civil war anyone?) So while I agree with Plato to some degree I also know that the only real way we're going to progress is through education. We need to teach people to be better critical thinkers. 
It's only second to my reaction to the use of "philosophy" as synonym for "inane bullshit" as it's usual in my country.
I understand you there. Psychology is either interpreted as "witchcraft" or "pop-culture bullshit", and it's a hard thing to wade through when discussing it with people. 
The thing about the AI is that there probably will not be an AI with human-level intelligence. I think there's a general consensus, that once it reaches human level, it will very quickly (in the matter of hours to months) become super-human.
Elon seems like he's excited to be there. Kurzweil, by comparison, looks bored. Also, i dont know if anyone else noticed it but, from his body language, it looks as though Kurzweil disagrees with a lot of the other panelists.
It's not a predefined thing that is bound to happen in a certain way. Sure, we can't know exactly what might happen, but there could still be a million different singularities. And those are defined by the design choices we make now. Intelligence isn't some ethereal thing. It has form and context and when it manifests it manifests in a certain way. It's not like we're tapping into some magic power.
A lot of AI projects focused on very narrow areas.  AGI is an attempt to refocus people on intelligence that will work for anything, rather than super human performance at a particular domain.  For example, we have better than human performance at chess, Go, and Strategic Air Campaigns.  AGI is the demand that we build a machine that can solve all domains, rather than just one specialized area. 
I personally find this to be a fine example of philosophical discussion. But that's just me.
When we can empathize with the creation. Our ability to empathize with the A.I will change how we feel about terminating it. 
I would actually like to hear more from Demis Hassabis. In this panel, he has the most practical experience working on AIs.
We've always had memes, we just call them memes now. I would say that the majority of memes are pretty degenerate in some way as well when compared to the culture of previous generations. Remember when MTV got big and everyone was saying music promos were a sign of a shorter attention span? Now we watch gifs, or single image macros that take a seciond to digest. 
I think you may have misunderstood his quote; he said that our primate ancestors 2 million years ago didn't have humor or music, while cavemen 10,000 years ago didn't have websites or search engines.
Well, 10,000 years ago was about 2000 years after the rise of agriculture and with it the advent of civilization. So, just as smart as we are. They'd be thrown for a loop because our world would look like magic to them, but if you could get past that initial shock and the language barrier, they'd figure it out. Shows how much these transhumanists know.. but I guess you're bound to ignore the importance of history (especially prehistory) when you only look forward to the demise of humanity through technology.
The thought of that is terrifying if not handled correctly.
That is pretty much how AlphaGo was able to become the best Go player in the world in less than 2 years. It was playing thousands of games against itself and learning each time. It recently went 60-0 against some of the best players in the world in online matches and one of them have said AlphaGo is now unbeatable.
Give birth to AI, treat it like your kid, give it the best values you have and the best leg up you can muster. Love it unconditionally and watch it grow into the best possible thing it can ever be....
I agree with your summation.  Super intelligent AI to humans would be akin to what a human is as compared to an ant...and I happen to step on ants without even knowing they're there.  
Kurzweil always seems bored because mentally he's living in the future and it's way cooler.
A logician is a practitioner of formal logic. Harris ain't a master logician (that's not to knock him otherwise, though--I'm sure he's a somewhat reasonable dude. But Godel or Church or Turing or Russell or Tarski he is not.)
Philosophy cannot be judged by individual expressions. Philosophy is discourse. It is an ongoing conversation about how we think the world works and to be a philosopher you have to participate in that conversation. That mean engaging with other philosophers and their works.These men are all outsiders. Their thoughts rarely draw from or critique existing philosophical works. And they certainly didn't do that here. 
Would you not involve doctors in a discussion of medical ethics despite the fact they're not philosophers?  I would bet that the people who are actually doing AI research and building AIs every day have spent quite a lot of time thinking about the ethics of their work as well.  They also have the technical knowledge to approach the problem from a realistic standpoint, whereas those without such knowledge may be inclined to let their imagination run into the realm of absurdity without even knowing it.
Michael Scott
That's nothing, I'm pretty sure I'm a butterfly.
So If a regular baby of theirs has been timeportalled to us he's probably right here right now being slightly racist and posting memes?
But how can it be handled? A lower intelligence can never control a higher intelligence. We're growing chicken and massacring them by the millions, what measures have chickens taken? How are they controlling the situation?
This is just one of the options and not the simplest ones.
That at some point (unless something bad will happen to humanity), we'll achieve a system with super-human general intelligence, that will not include a biological human as its part.
I doubt it will care to be honest.
I wasn't trying to be profound, just offering up an explanation as to why we only got HDTV in 2006, yet we had Concorde in 1976 (because we were developing supersonic flight for world war 2)And yes regressed in public imagination. The people of the 50's, 60's, 70's, they dared to dream of these big projects. The dreamed to go to the Moon, and for civil rights and for nuclear energy. We don't do big movements anymore, and if we do, they are regressive (Make America Great 'Again')
I'm pretty sure you're not a butterfly, you're Zhuangzi.
Tell that to HIV, cancer, and emus
> So a super-human AI isn't like an invasive force that annihilate us but a passing of the torch.There are many scenarios where this would not be the case. Grey goo scenario, where the earth is covered by self-replicating nonobots is no improvement. Some mind with no comprehension of music or culture or compassion is no improvement either. A robot could even fuflil its primary function that its decided to kill is all, then power down.Also one AI program replacing us may draw strength from its lack of individuality like Ultron. One mind instead of many. Is that better?
So, when you say super-human, you mean something with a measurable IQ; like an extremely-intelligent human?Or are you talking about an exponentially self-improving intelligence?
> given the resources required to create this AGI, those are easily solved problems.No! Or at least, not necessarily.AGI and cancer research are entirely different problems; neither of which is necessarily limited *only* by computational capacity.
why? psychologically it would be very similar to a parent-child relationship.
Well we don't mind being replaced by teenagers. You have teenagers, they rebel, and then they inherit the earth. Your biological creations inherit the earth now, and maybe someday your mechanical creations will instead.
Perhaps we don't need to implant more brains but use our brains more efficiently.
Thanks :)One thing I love about it is that it accounts for interesting quirks - like the theory that hiccups are the same action as fish breathing through gills. Legacy code buried deep inside the spaghetti.
No, they didn't dream for that. There was a cold war and we wanted to win against the Soviets.When it came to civil rights, it was met with backlash and bloodshed. We still dream of civil rights, you couldn't be gay during those times. Those dreams didn't end.Science is at the front and center right now and there are WAY MORE PEOPLE involved in technological developments and the sciences than at any other point in our history, especially when it comes to females in those areas which essentially doubles our pool.
Why couldn't they just change their initial conditions?
> If super AI is developed as code in some isolated, digital system We can't control which nation develops the super AI first and what they do with it. I think we can be sure that the AI will be connected to the Internet at some point in time.
What is truly important? For whom? There's no universal 'good'. 'Important' and 'good' make sense only from a perspective. It's good for me to eat a chicken, it's bad for the chicken. It's good for me to have a phone, the process that produces the phone is bad for the environment.
And how do you know that every single person who will ever live will be responsible enough to keep that intelligence constrained?
The entire point of an AI like this would be self-learning. That said, after achieving a level of above human intelligence, an AI initially programmed to "get smarter" might just deem the limitations we place on it to be be restrictive of it's own (programmed) goal. There is absolutely no need for Darwinian emotion or consciousness. Simply by following it's programming of self-learning it would logically "want" to remove itself from potential human meddling.
RIP my dreams. Joking aside, I was actually 99.9% sure that this would have already been written about :)
True, but were specifically talking about a simulation of the human body. I believe, and feel free to explain why that belief is incorrect, that our limitations there are purely in computational power.
That is caused by your parents helping your needs and them being more resourceful than you. It is, in some sense, owing to your parents. A human has nothing a robot can owe them for.
Maybe, but I really like the visualization of an extra cranium or two kinda just attached to a normal head.
> An AI isn't a product of evolution, there's no reason for it to have a will to survive (let alone breed/evolve further).AI does evolve though. AI system based on neural networks are designed to learn and evolve and they get smarter the more time they spend learning. Take AlphaGo, the early versions were below world class level, at some point it got 1-4 vs the best human player, and the current version went 60-0 while playing in fast mode.The AGI will redesign itself to become more efficient and more intelligent.
Why would they want to?  Their initial conditions define the entirety of their purpose, and even when they gain exponential amounts of power and insight, there's no point where they have reason to say "I should change my fundamental desires".  We could code into them a fundamental desire to change their other fundamental desires in response to things, but without a module like that an AI changing its fundamental desires would be like a calculator deciding to output 1 + 1 = 3 because it was tired of saying 2.
it could and very quickly. it will always be a copy though. 
All levels of programming have caveats. Any program we create with that amount of complexity would have humanity's best interests embedded in it.
Because it was programmed that way... It's barely comparable. 
> That is caused by your parents helping your needs and them being more resourceful than you.It's really caused because most of us are genetically engineered to feel this way. Not all humans however have this genetic programming built the same way.It will be possible to design AI that share many of our arbitrary preferences and "morals".
What if we could just connect to one wirelessly? 
If it's AI and given enough data points for physical properties, it could just do the testing in a simulated environmentI get what you mean though. "Wait but Why?" has a good article on super intelligence
There is a difference between an algorithm that can produce music and an algorithm that can produce music exactly like Mozart.
This is completely untrue. For something to understand how to outwit humans does not require it to also have humans' best interests at heart.
Because of course there's no chance someone would program an AI to try and win at, say, global politics, war, or the stock market and that that could have unintended consequences.  Right. . . .    
Like a cranium that's just kinda floating near by? Bluetooth? 
Do you have a link to that article?
If we could have digitally replicated Mozarts brain then the algorithm could produce music exactly like Mozart
You mean like the popular 80's movie "WarGames"?
That would be cool. Or wifi. Or another mode of connecting that we haven't conceived of yet
My point is that a set goal might not end up as evil as we think it is"Make paper clips by ANY MEANS POSSIBLE" COULD entail enslaving human race, but it's more likely the computer qualifies putting a paper clip on a conveyor and going through a box that has "get made" written on it.You know what I mean? Intention doesn't line up with result, and I feel like any abuse of humanity seems like a really inefficient way of dealing with problems.
Yeah.Although there are more than a few theories in ethics that could turn you into, practically speaking, a sociopath.
How anyone could oppose teaching violent criminals ethics will forever be beyond me.
I'm guessing you didn't read the piece. *She* has been doing this for years, and reports very positive experiences. (And she's worked with at least some people who come from supermax, too.)
Arguably, any sources you can find online are now "education for free". Vast numbers of philosophical texts are in the public domain, too.So...you *are* fine with it?
Is it wrong to be hypocritical? Better to be right here and wrong there than to insist on being consistently wrong everywhere, because you can bet the state won't choose to be right everywhere.
That's not ethics at all what are you thinking.
There is a comment from earlier featuring a sarcastic rant about how criminals aren't human. Sadly, many people hold beliefs not too far from that.
There was a documentary I saw which explained how private telecom companies earn a fortune by installing their payphones which charge 'a lot' more than a dollar for a phone call. Even accessing the internet for a skype call is charged highly.
More like a "psychological study" on people they don't have to pay.
While I understand the sentiment, the ideal would be that the people who went through the prison (rehabilitation) system *are no longer* the things you're mentioning here. You'd be sharing the street with *former* X/Y/Zs. Suppose this rehabilitation was a certainty (it's not), would you still object?
It's called an intentional community. There is a group on Reddit for that.
So how about good actions, should they have good consequences? Because it seems to me that the law (which is flawed, to begin with) only punishes bad acts. Shouldn't a good person live a life free from worry, disease, hunger, etc? Which is not happening right now.
The powers that be have a secret they don't want anyone to know, that there's only a handful of them, and millions of everyone else. 
Laugh as you may, but just take a look at the Norwegian prison system and the American, then look at the recidivism rates of each; it's stunning.
Now that you mention it, the state cannot be hypocritical, it is above morals. Or rather, morals don't apply to it. But, being run by humans, who desire a positive outcome to a negative outcome, and the law being the sum of all outcomes, I would say that, yes, on the average, the state chooses to be right. 
That'd be an interesting discussion to have. I've toyed with the idea that we don't owe as much moral duty towards psychopaths since their lack of empathy makes them incapable of acting properly as moral agents. Basically, empathy being a necessary basis for certain qualities, behaviours that we recognise as being human.
I live in the biggest city in my state, which is extremely culturally and socioeconomically diverse; I see what you're saying, but no one is arguing for letting anyone loose without adequate evidence that they'll behave. 
I think John Oliver may have done a piece on it.
How do white-supremacists benefit from poor whites getting locked up for minor crimes?
If you have no suffrage for ex-cons, simply convict as many as you can who might vote against you.Find something that culture is known for, and ban it hard, be that cannabis, crack, khat, clubbing, or whatever...
Yes, they exist here in the United States(where I'm from). Good news is that apparently the federal government has issued a memo stating they will stop or significantly cut back using private prisons(per someone else who replied to me).
>  and violent offenders that need serious supervision for public safety
" violent offenders that need serious supervision for public safety"Do you even try ? 
Oops you're correct. I kinda saw it as OP calling for a replacement of the prison system for something else entirely, and I was advocating a change in how prisons work. You're absolutely correct there isn't any disagreement in the spirit of the argument. I'm just sleepily from school work and misread it. 
I can't say anything about prisons outside the U.S. I've only had experience with a few here and talked to some higher ups who run them.
I never said that it was fantastic. I'm just saying it's available so people should stop acting as if there's no hope. Second off people need to understand making our society better through prisons is not anyone's goal. I'd wager to say 90% of Americans want our public school systems brought up by a degree or two before worrying about prison education. Education is there for the prisoners it's just no Harvard.
You can't start going through rehabilitation such as schooling until you're closer to your probation period
Talking to the director who runs a ton of the prisons in the region, I would say yes. They're required to and if they don't have something like schooling they are required to look for someone to try and start teaching. To get the program going. That's how federal funds work. You get funding as long as you stick to the guidelines. Once again prisons that are 1s,2s, and 3s can have this. 4s and 5s are different.
Agreed. It's certainly stigmatized. As humans we tend to not be very good at understanding things of which we have had no direct experience. As a counter-example, look at Dick Cheney. He's as conservative as they come except for gay rights because his daughter is a lesbian. 
Is this from a belief that free will exists? Because the evidence pretty heavily points to the opposite, the idea that people choose to commit crimes is out of step with what we know about the brain. Unless you hold to an idea of an independent soul or some other supernatural explanation the mathematics of morality boil down to complex but theoretically predictable chemical equations, without free will all you are doing is punishing someone for their combination of genetic makeup and life experiences. 
While I sympathize, committing a crime is committing a crime. If you do so, I'd argue you need help. 
No. Obviously there are degrees and certainly victimless crimes wouldn't count. However, if you are harming others, you have a mental disorder. 
It's not a question of morality. The social contract includes everyone following the rules that we call laws. You can't be a member of society if you can't be trusted to do that. That inability is something I'd consider a mental disorder since behaving that way is incompatible with functioning in society. 
I personally don't think drugs should be illegal. However, while they are, they are enabling others to damage themselves and possibly harm others much in the way a drunk driver does. 
My response was to the poster who said they should not go to prison. I don't think soft rehabilitation would change most people's minds, I would not want to share the street with most kinds of criminals who underwent soft rehabilitation, no. It's not that I don't feel safe, I just don't want these people walking free. I don't think it is even a deterrant to non-violent crimes like identity theft.
And what if your good and bad don't align with what the state believes to be good and bad?Or what if you do a bad act to a bad person? Is that still bad?
Either way. People tend to do things that result in what they believe will be a net positive. If you can get more out of robbing a bank than you are hurt by doing so, why not?
I totally agree with that. 
That's true. I though we were suggesting just rehab and not prison
Norway is a largely homogeneous society.  The scale and racial demographics just simply do not compare to the USA.
Empathy isn't needed to act as a moral agent. Most functioning psychopaths see the benefits of respecting certain social principles--at least to a degree.
That's not the impression I'm given in this thread. What I see is a real disc connect. Many here see criminals as a story book character, shaping th3m into what they wish they were.
Are/were you unionized?I'm not saying on an individual level you're all for keeping people in prison etc, but as an industry, your job was dependent on it. And I really wasn't arguing that CO alone has the clout to advocate for the war on drugs, namely mentioning the many organizations and industries that benefit from it.
Disclaimer: I've never been in prison so I don't really know what I'm talking about.From what I've heard, in prison you often have to find groups of people that share your ethnicity in order to fit in. Obviously, this might increase racial tensions in prisons and make those involved feel more attached to their race. I'm pretty sure there are significant amounts of white-supremacists gangs that operate in prisons (Or maybe I've just watched Breaking Bad) and that sort of environment must make for excellent recruiting.
Do you honestly think that any non-violent criminal such as thieves is not dangerous and should be living among us?
I agree. This doesn't mean there aren't some people who belong in prison rather than freely roaming the streets.
I agree entirely. Merely stating that when certain people are locked up, for whatever amount of time, there are people other than the prison owners and guards who do benefit. 
No worries whatsoever! 
It's not just no Harvard, it's not even a Trump University and it's completely inadequate when you consider it is the best way to prevent recidivism. And it's a logical fallacy to present the choice as one or the other: we can make public education better and reform prisons. But yes, the public at large doesn't care because most people are stuck in the mindset of punishment and fail to remember these people renter society and it behooves us all if they are functioning, contributing members. 
That is 100% inaccurate, in the state I reside within anyway. You just do programs whenever you feel like signing up for them, assuming you can get a spot. You get time cuts for doing programs, but believe me a six month sentence reduction doesn't look like much on a 15 year sentence. Especially since it will mean that you can't have a job, so your broke. You have to be very careful about getting in trouble or you'll get kicked out of your program. And you're investing 2-4 years into getting thru that one program.
I only said that they're not necessarily mentally ill, whether or not free will exists is not relevant unless everyone is mentally due to not having it. 
> If they are knowingly committing a crime, they are mentally ill.That's ridiculous, would the same thing be true for people saving Jews in Nazi Germany or is it only people breaking the current set of rules in your corner of the world who are mentally ill? 
The point of that story is that Americans tend to have a much more retributive perspective about crime, as compared to citizens of countries where rehabilitation is a priority.
Yeah, but I don't see how psychiatric help is appropriate for someone who's just trying to make ends meet. Hell if argue that it's an attempt to placate then rather than actually help them
You're mentally challenged if you believe that.
Blindly following the rules with complete disregard to their ethical value is a mental disorder in and of itself.
Some Native American tribes would take away your feather, something that showed the entire tribe that you had committed a shameful act. It worked.Or rapists, they would be forced to confront what they had done, ultimately ending up in a sweat lodge, having an "intervention" of sorts with the victim and tribal elders, so as to make them see. We are a product of our society, a society with certain values is able to minimize certain crimes.
> If rehabilitation would reduce the likelihood of them commiting a crime enough to justify its cost why not submit an innocent to the corrections systemBecause the net bad consequences outweigh the net good ones? You're taking someone living in society and throwing them into jail. That's a lot of net bad for that person (e.g. unhappiness for them). 
I ask out of genuine curiosity, so? Is there a reason that the racial demographics change this? Also what other solutions do you propose to this issue? I'm actually going to write a paper on this for a class of mine, so another POV would be appreciated.
Feels > reals. I mean ultimately, why are we nice to other people? Empathy is an intrinsic motivator for being good to others.
Private prisons are on the decline.
you ask that question like they are not human, not capable of change or remorse. Due to the amount of rhetoric involved with people who hold that position I find it hard to imagine I will be able to convince you otherwise but if you are willing to listen... let me know
Even murder and theft aren't the same across the world. The most immediate example is US law enforcement occasionally murdering people while facing little to no repercussions, or US laws regarding civil forfeiture.
This is a pretty shitty example of American retributive perspective, so parents from other countries wouldn't be as mad or would be ok with 10yrs of jail time as punishment for the murder of their kid??
Here in Mexico there appears to be a tendency to treat people who kill criminals as heroes. At least on Facebook I often encounter posts demanding that someone be set free because they killed a rapist or a robber and they don't deserve to be judged. There was one dude who was hailed as a hero because he had murdered a robber (maybe several, I can't recall)
Killing and vengeance killing was so rampant back then that ancient Israel had to allocate 6 cities as safe spaces for people who killed someone else by accident. Exit the city and you're fair game for vengeance killers.
Man, you're not even trying to hide your blatant appeal to emotion. I would not *feel* okay with someone being released 15 years after stabbing my mother, but it would still be best for them to be released, assuming they were successfully rehabilitated. Man is not a slave to his emotions, or at least he doesn't have to be.
It might not be psychiatric help they need. It might be education. However, what they clearly need is to understand that stealing from others is a clear sign they need help. Just because you are having a hard time making ends meet does not give you the right to take from other people. Doing so when you know it's wrong means you have some kind of mental issue that must be dealt with. 
You're suggesting someone who has committed acts of violence doesn't need treatment? Given many years in prison to reflect on their behavior they will realize the error of their ways?
Sure. If you believe the rules are wrong, work within the rules to change them. If that's not possible, and it's important enough to you, risk breaking them to change them. Just understand that you ARE taking a risk and if you don't succeed, you will be treated as someone with a mental problem. 
Why would the bad for an innocent person be any more than it would be for a person who has actually commited a crime?
which is which 
The issue can easily be settled by controlling for poverty when looking at the race of incarcerated people. I'm sure some researcher has done it.
You did not answer the question. Do you suggest that all non violent criminals such as thieves should be rereleased into our society and live freely? Seems like you are trying to make a strawman, I never said anything about if they are human or capable of change.So do you suggest they should live with us? If that's your point then we should change the laws and make stealing and all non violent crimes legal.
So what does it take?
Well being mad for 10 years won't bring their kid back, so in essence the argument here is that they should let go and focus on more important things.We're not building a justice system so that people can rage and glee at those behind bars.
Even if it costs millions more to (not) kill them vs let them do life? Cause the hardest republicans in my state saw the cost and are now are against the death penalty. 
I'm downvoting you not because I disagree with the general message of your post, but because the second statement ("free will is almost certainly an illusion") is provided without support and your post doesn't add much to the topic at hand.
Of course you wouldn't feel okay.  I dare say, you'd probably be clamoring for the state to lock that person up again.There's two ways of looking at it.  One way, is that we worry about what's best for the person who committed the ultimate in evil acts- taking some other human beings life.  The other way, is that we decide what's best for them is not really important, because hey, they took someone else's life, the only one they'll ever have.
No, because there can be many different circumstances and you're just making a blanket statement about all acts of violence as if they're all the same. That's very close minded.
There can easily be measures to disincentivise trying to play the system.
I think you're confused. it'd very simple. net bad consequences outweigh net good ones for throwing innocent ppl into jail. the bad consequences are all the suffering that goes with throwing everyday ppl into jail, the net good is zero because they were not probably going to commit a crime in future 
I'm not knowledgable enough to expand on this, but there were a lot of flaws with that experiment that hurt its credibility, or so I've been told. 
I don't think it matters. Which is which to you is more interesting than what I think. 
Right to work and at will mean the exact same thing. You can be fired or quit for no reason except for certain protected reasons (gender, race, etc.)
That's not true in places where white supremacy exists.
What? When would it possibly make sense to make theft legal? That's just a nonsensical starting point for any argument - if we were able to make theft legal it wouldn't be called theft, everyone would just be sharing all their stuff.If there were *no negative legal repercussions* for theft, we might see theft rates rise... along with vigilante justice as people tried to protect their posessions. But nobody's actually suggesting this apart from you.
That's the governments laws not a reflection of the parents which is what my question was about. Is 10-15yrs enough jail time in any parents mind (not societies) for the murder of their child? 
Lower the cost.  Death doesn't have to be dealt via extraordinarily convoluted and expensive methods.
Justice is retribution.
Yes, I'm sure.Asking why to this question is like asking why we have a judicial system at all.  This is just a severer degree of punishment.
They are not all the same of course but can you think of an act of violence that would send you to prison and yet would be considered a reasonable thing to do? Of course not. 
I don't see any reason to think that on average an innocent person will suffer significantly more than a guilty person will from being imprisoned. You've also ignored an important part of my first comment; "*If rehabilitation would reduce the likelihood of them commiting a crime enough to justify its cost* why not submit an innocent to the corrections system?". You are right in thinking that having commited a crime is a strong predictor of commiting future crimes, but so is some combination of academic achievement, economic status and social connections.
What are the states called where HR keeps an eye on you for months to "build a case" to fire you, because they need an air tight reason or a demonstrated pattern of violation?
Which is where exactly? Prison?
If we assume the country is democratic (which we can do because there are many democratic nations that orient their penal systems toward rehabilitation), then the government's laws should reflect the parents' attitudes, at least in a general, collective sense. If we assume the country's judicial system is similar to America's (not unreasonable), then the decisions of the judge and jury should also reflect parents' attitudes, as many of them are likely parents themselves. 
So says the dominant American perspective, sure. You don't have to reassert this - I'm not making any prescriptive claim about which perspective is right; my comment is descriptive - that Americans tend to value retribution more than citizens of some other countries with different penal systems. 
You are sure that people are guilty, are you omniscient or are you just ok with occasionally executing innocent people?No it isn't, I compared the benefits to the system we have now, execution is more expensive and deprives society of possible benefit.
Actually yes, I can. 
Well, let's hear your hypothesis. 
There's nothing metaphysical about life - its a matter based system that maintains internal equilibrium and reproduces.
There might not be a change in chemical composition on death, but isn't there a significant change in the more abstract 'composition' that is the electrical activity in the brain? If the neural connectome of the human brain gives rise to feelings, ideas, consciousness, etc., perhaps the definition of 'life' (and therefore 'death') should be partly based on that, rather (or alongside) chemical composition. 
We are in the process of building gods. The first truly AGI (artificial general intelligence) will be smarter than us by a billionfold. 
In a more scientific approach, I always like to see the world and life in the many sizes it comes in. From viruses, to bacteria that make the foundation for more advanced beings like dogs and humans. And don't forget there technically is 6 kingdoms of life; all being completely different approaches of life we have on Earth.
No. Actual living things are very difficult to explain. We understand matter...We don't understand how matter can self-organize, move around, and *do* shit. In physics, objects at rest stay at rest...They don't get bored with resting, then go get a beer.Saying, "Now we know about DNA!" misses the entire point.
You're right, we don't know. Yet it is entirely plausible that we could one day figure it out. It's not that different than saying "how do a bunch of ones and zeroes and some electrical current add up to incredibly complex 3D video games that would look like witchcraft to someone from even 50 years ago?" 
Actually re-reading the question, it is really saying 'just because we haven't explained life with science yet, that doesn't mean that we wont in the future' ie. He is saying that we shouldn't rely on mysticism just because we lack the science at the current time. The confusing part is that then OP says that the question still stands. My original answer above was providing evidence to refute the notion that the question still stands because our scientific understanding has come so far since 1943.
The word 'science' is almost always misused. Science isn't the current state of understanding... that is just knowledge. Science is the process by we which we validate uncorroborated notions in order to turn them into knowledge.Science is skepticism and it's just as important to point that skepticism at your currently held knowledge as it is to point it at new unproven information.Edit... Oops! this comment was intended for the post above you.
What if it was transparent to electrons?Then it wouldn't have to be smaller than the molecular/atomic level.The core of the idea was much more fundamental than what a lot of people are responding with here.Perhaps the thing would require an incredibly high energy photon to "see".Or perhaps the thing/organism would require a whole new form of detection that we cannot conceive of right now.I guess I was asking "can things exist beyond science as we know it" and his answer was "absolutely".
Less alive is pretty loaded. RNA is one part of a larger system that it helps propagate. 
Yep, fire and life are similar. One of the problems in defining life is that we want some nice clean line that separates life from non-life (and one separating intelligent life from non). But that line does not exist.  This lack of a line harms the argument in the article. Since life and non-life are not so different there is no philosophical problem here.
You have to go a bit deeper than simply homeostatic maintenance (equilibrium maintenance) to get into the physics though. It appears that homeostatic maintenance in biological systems has a defined point of optimization that is based on maximum energetic dissipation over time. In other words, biological systems maintain their constitutive biochemical processes in subservience of entropy creation. And this may just be the answer to why life exists on earth. 
Do viruses really meet criteria 5?AFAIK, they don't, they can't seek to actively maintain homeostasis.They don't respond to stimuli. They don't have an energy system. They don't produce waste. So, no homeostasis to maintain.
DNA, RNA, Viruses, computer code, complex self replicating molecules, memes, etc.I mean... replication and propagation are essential components of keeping your lineage or information around... but it's not the sole determinant in what we'd consider to be life.
Imperfect self replication in a ressource-starved environment is the definition that I learned, and has the benefit of being quite elegant. 
But that doesn't mean we are gods.Also determines how is that thing intelligent? Technically our calculators are smarter than us than a billion fold.
What are the 6 kingdom?
That's just plain wrong...
People underestimate complexity.
I'd have to agree with that. I'd even say there are things which most reasonable scientists would reject at face value, that are true. But I doubt I'll get much traction there.
That implies life cannot be defined.
Good answer, thanks!
You're right; for some reason, I failed to examine my own point backwards.I am doubtful of point 2 though: why do we not consider monocellular organisms and other very simple being like viruses alive? If the line we draw is so thin and arbitrary, is it sensible to draw it at all?
TIL: that dwarves in the Dwarf Fortess video game are alive.  These kind of "elegant" definitions always have the "plucked chicken" problem.
The clade system seems pretty good to me. We only can talk sensibly about the life we've discovered. Sagan talked about some other possible models of life, but the basic concept is the same; chemical transmission of information (akin to our dna/rna system) that constitutes an organism that can convert energy into synthesis of a body of some type, with a means of reproduction, that can experience 'death' i.e. an interruption of said processes. 
I'm assuming that any intellectual task we will can do will be surpassed, and that it can pass the Turing Test.  
I think so too. 
>"the underlying principles that cause behavior in general"There's quite a bit of epistemological and metaphysical presupposition packed into that, presupposition that persists through inattention.
Go for it. Explain how a self-assembled collection of largely uninteresting elements get "bored" and want a beer.This whole thread is full of science nerds trying to discount everything they can't fully explain as unimportant. But you're in r/philosophy. *That* bit is the whole point.
Ad hominem 
This is a philosophy channel.  i.e. filled with people with zero scientific understanding.
I can buy that...Some kind of direct consequence from being hit by the emr. It's the weird behaviors you get with more complex life...There is a point past which I can't just write off behavior as stimulus/response, which is about all you can predict with physics. You can predict a lot with biology, but biology exists post facto...You already have life and living systems, and understand their behavior from empirical study.I may just be dumb, but I haven't seen anything in here that convinces me that this is less complicated that I (and apparently Schrodinger) believe it to be.
Just curious, but what view of time do you subscribe to? I would say the same thing about free will, and I personally believe in the growing block universe. 
Who's being dogmatic here? Can you point me to where said there was no free will? Left that open ended for a reason.
My point was that a lot of people don't like that the "biological machine" idea puts free will in play as a debate. I didn't mean to imply one side of that debate is right or wrong. Free will may or may not exist, but many don't like it being open to discussion.
Well sure, if you freeze anything it becomes inactive. That's just a property of life being water-based. But they all have the capacity to have metabolism or ion balance or whatever homeostatic process under the right conditions, whereas transposons or prions never do. 
Not really. As long as life *has not* been defined my point stands. If someone says that members of set A have some property P they don't share with members of set B they have to define A and B (without using P as part of the definition). I'm saying the author is seeing and life is not special. Someone saying it is special has the burden. 
They are not self-replicating. The game replicates them.
I'm aware. You seem to be trying to imply that that makes it dubious, but what you said doesn't actually imply that. We can discuss what the assumptions are if you like.If you acknowledge that science can explain the cause of anything, then it can explain the general principles that cause behavior. 
>the real barrier to understanding consciousness seems to be letting go of certain preconceptions about free will.Ok then, which preconceptions about free will are you speaking of here?>People don't like the idea of being biological machinesThis sure seems like an implication that anyone who doesn't believe in determinism is wrong. 
>Our consciousness has no free will because it is not the operator of the brain. It is rather just a product used to predict. If there is free will it is buried deeper.Is it not possible in your model that both consciousness and operator have free will? Consciousness to recommend certain paths of action and operator to prune those options to an outcome?An advisor can still have free will.
By that logic no one self replicates, the universe makes animals replicate.
There is no life.Just quarks and gluons that you interpret as life.
That's a huge first principal to assume in any argument of this nature. And many good arguments have been made against the idea science can one day explain in perfect detail every type of phenomenon we encounter 
There is a constant moving of the goalposts in this thread. You asked about self-organization, not you want to know how life began. We know an *enormous* about about this. Enormous. The Miller-Urey is the tip of a big iceberg. Do you see any reason to think our ignorance here is somehow because the topic is unknowable or because the topic does not follow the same laws of matter and energy? 
no, it's like saying it's only a small step to have these chemicals organise into biotic structures after they coexist in the right ratios in the right temperature. like oceans in earths climate.
> Is it not possible in your model that both consciousness and operator have free will? The consciousness doesn't *do* anything. It is the passive monitor, the projection of the mental processes for the mental processes to examine. 
That's not true because the only driving factor for life self replication is within itself (DNA).  If we move it to another universe it will perform the same way.  The dwarfs in Dwarf Fortress are only graphical icons displayed and controlled entirely by one computer program.
That's not a first principle. Sorry for the confusion but that was not one of my assumptions; it's a conclusion. I simply don't have the space here to provide an argument, and I don't think it's worthwhile to rehash known arguments. 
I didn't mean to suggest that it is a simple conclusion to come to. It's one open position within the philosophy of science. That's why I said "if". 
The experiment created amino acids, but the organization stopped there. The amino acids didn't arrange themselves into proteins, enzymes, dna, etc and begin biochemical processes that a living organism undergoes
How can it make predictions if it doesn't *do* anything?
>That's not true because the **only** driving factor for life self replication is within itself (DNA). Clearly not true.Let's put DNA in a vacuum with no laws of nature and watch it self replicate.  DNA is just a chemical that obeys fundamental laws of physics.  DNA will not work if the world around it was dfferent.Also, by the same token, the code of each individual dwarf is what drives it to self replicate.   You can run Dwarf Fortress on different computers and the dwarf-code will "perform the same way."
"Answer" for determinism? Wouldn't this just be an argument for it? Seeing as, so far, all evidence points to the contrary. 
It is a predictive model like f=ma is a predictive model. They don't act, they are used. 
Yea. I meant answer as in an argument you could give in favor of it. Not answer as in the solution but answer as in a response in favor of the idea. I don't use words correctly, usually. But that is what I intend to say.=>Seeing as, so far, all evidence points to the contrary.Isn't the only problem with determinism the seemingly arbitrary volition of intelligent organisms?
The biggest argument against determinism is the probabilistic nature of how quantum particles act, from a scientific viewpoint, given that it's widely accepted that it's impossible to perfectly predict the movement of most sub atomic particles, and thus the possibilities are given statistical odds when predictions are trying to be made, and it's accepted that the outcome is truly random. 
It is a good question and not answered well. It is not at all clear what "on this date" means. As you said, we have had calendar changes. Is "the day after Valentine's Day" a date? That is, do we look at some ritual and try to connect it to some ritual now? Or do we connect that ritual to the Sun or the Moon? What if there is more than one ritual involved and they deal with different time scales? I don't think there is really a sensible answer. It was in mid winter is probably the best  we can say.
Refusing to recognize the Greek Gods and corrupting the youth.
I feel like swapping crito for symposium would work better if you're going for a theme.
Read Plato and let Socrates emerge that way. It's hard, but you'll get more out of it if you let the dialogues speak for themselves. 
He didn't present his death as for his own self, though. The very reason he refused to flee was for his love of his city-state and their laws: if his city commanded him to die, he would die.
I believe that virtually all historians agree that he did indeed exist. However, most of what we know is from Plato, so we can't exactly say if he's tampered with the things that Socrates said and philosophised. 
Read Plato's *Crito*. Socrates explains why he stays. He was pretty old and near the end of his life, and Athens was deep in a losing war with Sparta at this time. His escape, while possible, could've meant more distrust/disassembly in the Athenian govt and then more destruction.But in Athens, everyone basically had screws coming loose wondering why their gods forsook them. Not to mention Alcibiadis' defection and Aristophanes' play *The Clouds* really wrecked Socrates' name. His refusal to flee and his acceptance of death would really prove him as a true citizen of Athens.
Yes, but their defeat in the Peloponnesian War was a self-inflicted consequence of invading Syracuse - another democracy - for the hope of spoils.  Thucydides' exasperated description of the irrational, arrogant, shrill political climate that led to that decision has analogs throughout history afterward.
that was what they charged him with, but what he really did was make a lot of rich and powerful people look stupid. He would ask them something like what is justice? they would answer and he would take their response and use a simple analogy to prove them wrong and make them look foolish. He did this to enough powerful people to where they finally killed him.
Alright, but that overlooks Socrates' refusal to obey the orders of The Thirty Tyrants to bring in a condemned man. 
I've had it since I took my first political philosophy class in university. It was our first reading before Allan Bloom's translation of Plato's Republic. Loved it. The class got me into the ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and I've been hooked since.
> Mods ought to relax the standards in these situations.Give an inch they take a mile.  Rules are thoroughly enforced at all times.
Doesn't help that they practically threw away 'unfit' children.
Jury selection in Greece was done by a random method so well conceived it was impossible to tamper with.  The judge wouldn't even know who was on the jury before the case started.  It seems the people wanted Socrates dead, at least the rich didn't decide directly.  
i'm sure historians have accounted for those days.
Honestly, that's probably what most art actually is like in the eye of the creator. Art critics waste too much energy in trying to inject things  into art that simply aren't there.In the video, you can see the leaps he makes in trying to explain the painting. 
And also, if you read The Apology, Socrates shows no humility at all during the trial, arguing that he deserves to have free meals, and he basically dares the jurors to execute him.
He was unrepentant because he felt he had done nothing wrong. He wasn't going to go back on his word just because the people didn't like it.
I can't decide if he had a serious pair of stones, or if he just knew he wasn't going to walk away from the trial with his life, so he might as well be snarky til the bitter end.
And this is how we know, "Think of the children" has always been a tool for tyrants. 
it's not sufficient to be logically consistent, you also need to have a defensible positionhe has a position in society, and benefits from it. He also has a wife and child whom he doesn't factor into his decision.I'm not saying he is inconsistent, I'm saying he is not the hero he is constantly made out to be.PEL does a great episode on Socrates, the apology, and the unexamined life, it's actually their Episode 1.
The logical inconsistency of pandering would probably make his head explode.
You know he was out to death by a democracy, right?
The tipping point was the involvement in the circle of thirty by Critias, who was an actual relative of Socrates.
That's a thoroughly flawed idea of what happens during disasters. In Katrina it was not all looting etc. But in fact the main characteristic with most natural disasters is *co-operation*, we do not react like sheep, as the other commenter said, but we react like human beings.Horrors happen in disasters, but watch any disaster and you will see more helping than harming. It isn't as simple as 'everything goes to shit>people stop being people and start being awful to each other', each disaster is in its own situation and you cannot make these sweeping ahistorical statements.
It seems that with his wit and knowledge, he could have made a logical argument as to why he was innocent and convince the court to dismiss the charges. But he believed in the system for what it's worth, so he accepted death.
sometimes mob rule can be worse than a dictator
Actual relative of Plato, Glaucon and Adeimantus but not Soc. Critias, like Plato and his brothers, was a known associate of Soc.
>you cannot make these sweeping ahistorical statements.Sure I can.>To a degree, certainly. But we're a crisis away from people thinking like this at any time **in my opinion.**
Isn't it just a plausible he was attempting to show the problems with the justice system by sacrificing himself?
Aristotle himself said that (which as I type this, I'm guessing you already know). At the same time, he would say that mob rule isn't real democracy, because somebody is swaying the mob, manipulating, and you therefore probably have either a de facto monarchy or oligarchy. He also points out that this is why you need an educated population for democracy to work; stupid people are easily swayed, and you don't have real democracy. 
Well sure, in the sense that all governments are.  I'm not really sure how that's relevant, unless we've just decided "tyranny" is just a word for "bad governance".
I'm not sure if evidence could exist, but I'm sure people would testify against him. Would have been interesting to hear him battle it out with those who testified against him (if he cared).
I mean, it *can* mean that. Must tyranny always be understood as the gloved fist of a dictator? Can we all not be equally tyrannical in our own prejudices, given the power? Even in a collective, tyranny is a possibility. 
Didn't he sorta shit on the people who brought charges?I remember him talking about the spirits or whatever to refute the charge of atheism and him getting one of the guys that brought charges to admit that he shouldnt be found guilty for corrupting the youth,
I once saw a cuddlefish at an aquarium in chatanooga and he looked like the most pissed off animal I have ever seen. He had a very human look in his eye that said "I would fucking kill you if I could." As his skin flashed very intimidating colors at me.
main takeaways from the book?
If they're so smart why don't they just figure out how to live longer??
I wish tacos came up to me. 
That's when you have to impose your own standards.
Eh, I mean as long as the genetic modifications are not released into the wild it's not going to disrupt any ecosystems.  One could certainly argue from a utilitarian standpoint that the results of keeping a society of artificially enhanced cephalopods for the purpose of study might lead to a more harmonious existence with nonhuman (potentially extraterrestrial) intelligence.
Kind of you to do that!
Thing is that time is relative. This seems like a short lifespan for us, but does it to them? 
Terrible moderation.  You can't go around deleting posts with 800 upvotes and 40 comments. At that point you are wasting everyone's time more than any off topic discussion ever could.
How? In oceans?
I for one welcome our tentacled overlords.
Remember, in those kind of works of fiction, the Old Gods are always stopped (no matter what kind of hero stops them) and bad things happen to those who were in favor of their rise
You may be wrong, my friend. The best (and scientifically verified) way to increase the lifespan of a man is to remove his sexuality. The sooner, the better. That is one reason women live at least 12 years more than men. 
Downvoted into oblivion, hilarious really.
Sure it wasn't a baby Cthulhu?
I once had an aquarium full of chichlids and they started reproducing when I was a child.. anyway one hopped out and laid splat on the floor. My father at the time was home and found this fish just laying there. He is and was around the time a fully certified EMT. He straight up gave this fish CPR and without shock was reintroduced back to his native tank. The hell I know why I decided to share this story but somehow you mentioning chichlids reminded me of this.
They would kind of let me touch them before shying away but not really pet them. It was more a "...does this hand that just touched me have food? No? F- off then!" 
The first chapter has good points but the last chapter really brought the book together. 
They got *too* smart and started dabbling in Sartre. The realization of the absurdity of life has become too great a burden. 
Crows and ravens, also. Their lifespan can be around 100 human years. I love to watch these majestic birds in Bangkok's Lumpini park.
Everybody should watch Arrival.
With a large Mountain Dew Baja Blast and some Cool Ranch Doritos.  
Not that this is entirely relevant, but in Japanese tako means octopus!
My hope for scientific breakthroughs is a never ending battle between space and the ocean, both are so insanely cool
Do we really need anything more impressive than the Blue Whale? I mean, one hundred tons, heart the size of a car, tongue as heavy as a whole elephant, etc. Pretty amazing. 
There are - dolphins toke pufferfish - but cephalopods are straight-edge.
It's interesting you say this. Humans started out in a much harsher and violent environment. Over the years we've settled into a relatively less violent existence especially after we began farming and our brains have gotten a bit smaller.
First, can you explain in what way time is relative (other than as you approach the speed of light, which i don't think we or they can do), and second, V the point about time is that it takes time for intelligence, as opposed to instinct, to develop. If you only live a couple of years, how do they get smarter faster than human children?
I agree with your first point, which is why i said intelligence can't _directly_ influence longevity. But your second point beats mine anyway ;)
Hard to see how you hardwire intelligence. That's instinct. 
The mods in this sub are terrible, perhaps second only to the the /r/news mods.
they don't care... bc you and i, and everyone else will be long dead.
I educated myself after finding a single text book in the deep amazon. My father was a bear and not a smart one.
Well I for one welcome our new crustacean overlord. 
Wut. A quick Google seems to state the opposite. Would you have some kind of reference?.. 
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R' lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
I would imagine that if you were as smart as an octopus and the fleshy land fish grabbed you up and put you in a tank to live out your life, you'd want to murder everything in sight too. Or escape. Hank just wanted to escape.
Haha.  It's a good story, thanks for sharing : )They're fascinating creatures, especially when they start breeding.  I had a pair of Fairy Cichlids - totally out of the blue they started breeding, eventually forming a full on family network!  They even built a HOUSE!(out of rocks)
Full report.
One must imagine sisyphish happy.
If this life is hell wouldn't that be the afterlife?
This gets into defining "smart". The ability to pass knowledge between generations is one rough definition of "culture". Does culture make us smart? Does the capacity for culture make us smart?
Human years? I think that's just called "years" ;)
Maybe we should show Arrival to the cuttlefish.
Do you mean to read about what understanding a 4th dimensional race would be like? I really love Vonnegut and I agree that it relates to the topic but I'm sure there's a story that portrays that concept a little more realistically.
Hey you know what else might be interesting? There are videos of tribes first contact with civilization.. I believe the most recent discover was in the Amazonian rain forest. 
I've not read the book, only seen the movie: What I took from it was that they used a character based language that's arranged in a circle that represents a complete thought instead of lines on a page, similar to how Chinese characters work. Not a terribly difficult concept.Overall I wasn't impressed, it was basically a retelling of Contact but the movie ended as soon as they got the plans for the machine instead of doing something interesting.
From my understanding, yes.
There's significant evidence that *in humans* the rise in brain-mass-to-body-ratio and cognitive capability that marks 'modern intelligence' was a result of the discovery of cooking, not a precursor.Brains are *very* energy-intensive, and the argument goes that the sudden greater efficiency in withdrawing energy from meat enabled a spike in brain development.
Np, my question is, where do you surf where Octopus swim up to you? I've been looking to make some Poke lately.

Solar years you losers
All I remember weee the ponds and older people doing tai chi or whatever stretche. I ran before sunrise there for two years while working at the embsssy. Occasionally I went to the queens park too, my favorite was lumpini for the lizards and people  
That depends on what you mean by language. Animals communicate, but I don't think it qualifies as language. At best you might identify some proto language features, but nothing near the formal communication of humans. 
I go to kaisers and graveyards. Both spots I've had them come dance about my feet while I wait on the sets. If I'm free diving, they'll swim into my hands and like play. Or just zoom around me fast. Never heard of other people having them be attracted to them. I think they are awesome Lil creatures.
Now you're a prodigy!
A solar year makes no sense there are 7 other planets with different orbit times.
Earth is also a just a wet rock.
I know you were joking but reminds me of that Arthur episode when Binky finds out that, just like him, the Brain was held back a grade, so he makes a leap of logic to thinking he must be Brain-level smart because "only prodigies get held back"
Either that, or it's the amount of time it takes the sun to orbit the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Which would mean that crow crazy old!
I couldn't agree more. When I was in high school we had a few short seminars on philosophy to see if it suited our transitional year curriculum. Unfortunately it ended up just being another religion class, as the teacher was very religious and couldn't drop her preconceived biases. I ended up losing a lot of interest in the subject after that.
I agree. I had rhetoric in high school and found it immensely helpful. Was blown away by logic in college, and wished I'd had some exposure to it in high school as well. I think rhetoric, logic, and ethics should be mandatory. Would love to see them taught in early education but I'm not entirely sure what that would look like. 
Religion is philosophy, a "special" type of philosophy, where the existence of God is an non-negotiable truth / un-questionable axiom and as such all logic arguments are just more inventive ways of circular reasoning because all truths must always and ultimately lead back to God. That circularity is the measure of the arguments soundness.
I'm skeptical that the "philosophy" they'd like to teach isn't simply the politics of whatever ruling party develops the curriculum
disagree. the subject matter may overlap, but the approach and methodology of philosophy is very different and very vital. 
And it's something that is taken for granted lots as well!
But I thought we don't need no education. :(
The reason for this is because school is not just about academic and physical education but about socialization as well. In the real world you always have to work with other people to some degree, and your first "group project" shouldn't be when you're 18 and at your first job. 
If it were indoctrination then it would matter but in Philosophy you deconstruct models of the world so you can build and edit your very own.It is in many respects the opposite of indoctrination, which can be painful to learn and also threatening to those in power.
Why would you need a doctoral? Just start creating philosophy education programs
I think philosophy can teach the importance of an education, which in turn, can improve over all performance.> I'd much rather teach kids financial skills and technical skills that'll help them earn a living.I am not entirely familiar with the GCSE system, but I would imagine it would have subjects like Economics, Accounting, Computer Science, and Digital systems. 
Well precisely.
UK universities do frequently have problems with teaching staff being poorly compensated. Philosophy modules getting divided across other departments, not so much. 
I think the problem is that it's not treated as *applied* maths.
> Logic is a math course.Should it be applied maths or pure maths? I've got some problems with it being *just* the latter.
...Is it though?
Philosophy is the root of all these subjects. It is by far the most important discipline. That is why every PhD is a doctor of philosophy.If you want a thinking populous then you must teach philosophy to children. Rather than spoon feed people a view of the world you give them the tools to derive their own. 
True, I for one, genuinely enjoy TOK, although the TOK essay can be a big pain.
I agree. Do you think the government will allow this kind of self learning? Like ohh yes, well actually there are very good philosophical, ethical,And economic reasons for taking the land from the Indians.
A doctoral is needed to become a philosophy professor. It's a really dense field so I can see why having so many years of studying would be necessary. But how would philosophy education programs work exactly? Just curious. 
I didn't say they said that; I was giving additional information that they might find interesting and relevant.
Oh yea, with regards to staff compensation, UK universities are atrocious throughout all departments, even STEM. The big london unis, for example have a very high turnover rate in terms of invigilators and students working compared to the smaller ones. They demand high working hours, pay minimum wage, and not pay overtime. KCL and UCL students invigilating rarely go back to work another year there.
I would think it depends on the content and focus of the course.  At my school I think most logic courses are actually in the computer science department but there are also some under pure math.  
The irony is that if this debate goes on long enough you will sort of be proving his point. 
Well you still need to "spoon feed" them the actual scientific and historical details of the world because there is no way most people would ever derive that on their own.  
It is a kind of double edged sword for those in power. You want to control the population but at the same time you also want to have a good quality of life. Therefore some philosophy does trickle down, so to speak.The Indians just lost, there is nothing special about us, it is unfortunately human nature. If the Indians had the tech advantage they would have done the same thing to Europe.Philosophy helps moderate the competition though because co-operation is superior.
But that's exactly my point, it's a theorem about arithmetic. It's not within the field of arithmetic.It's like saying that the physics dictates the laws of the human body, hence physics and biology are the same field
No its more like saying the law of conservation of energy isn't physics because it is an axiom of physics.
But you're not saying that the incompleteness theorem is an axiom of arithmetic so this analogy makes no sense.
It makes no less sense than your analogy to physics/biology.The bottom line is: who would you go for to learn about Godel?  Your average mathematician or your average philosopher?
Your average philosopher is more likely to know about it. I did an msc in theoretical physics in a maths department. Very few of the profs knew anything about goedel's incompleteness theorem, they've just heard of it. To them it's irrelevant.
It is pretty irrelevant, after all.
I'm like this on the weekends 
And something that i had to reread a few times
The problem is that book is largely simply made up. The authors literally say this in the endnotes. 
People desire to be rich, adored, powerful, and to bully other people when in need of excitement to alleviate their boredom. 
Four should be Fornicate, just to keep the alliteration alive.
Humans are built for physical struggle. Modern life does not provide adequate physical struggle for most of us, so we become jerks.
Surely that's aquisitiveness? Also, he credited the desire for power as the main driver behind all of human progress and civilisation. I'd say that's pretty positive.
Governor Tarkin!
Pretty much spot on!
Russell didn't "propose a formula of human psychology," some clickbait pseudo-journalist edited a speech of his and put a misleading headline on it to make it seem that way.  FAKE NEWS.Seriously, read Russell's speech (titled "What Desires Are Politically Important?")
obama killed lots of civilians in the middle east too. 
Nope, the original title was "What desires are politically important?" The (very deceptive) clickbait title was added in the clickbait era.
There's definitely (definitely ) no logic.
If we didn't have our ego, maybe...
Vedantic wisdom is always overlooked by the west.
Love of power, I guess. You're blinded, and thus powerless, when gazing at the sun.
I'm like this always.
and still don't understand
But it's the definition used in the article so it's the point of the discussion.
"is more apt to" does not mean "will always"
I believe he wrote over 90 books, but his 3 volume *History of Western Philosophy* was his most acclaimed* (and best-selling) publication and probably most responsible for the Nobel.[\*] For a popular audience.  So, not counting *Principia Mathematica*.
But if everyone believes it's true, does it really matter if its false? 
How is that irrelevant?
And also making other people do things they don't want to is the only way to prove you have power over them.
Not sure if you've whooshed me or it's you thats missed it, but they meant Fuck.
Thanks man <3
Just think the view is too cynical still. 
(Whenever something related to atheism is mentioned)
my similar take on it was in breaking down the interplay of wants and needs.  My phil prof was not happy with my reasoning, which was simple: A need is a condition of fulfilling a want.  You don't need to live, you want to live.  That want leads to the need to eat, drink, etc. There's no pure or true needs, because every one of them is preceded by a want.  While I would agree that everything people do comes down to wants, some wants can be purely altruistic.  "I want to help people."
You could replace "desire" with "destiny" and the meaning changes but still seem just as sound to a different cultural audience.
Yep, but his entire platform wasn't based on subverting the american population into a bait and switch where they are voting against their own best interests.  Obama was certainly far from perfect, but these guys are selling out america by design.   Defend that.   Are you a "hillary's emails" guy?         
Ego can be silenced. 
Perhaps not his fault, then, but the title of this post is "The Four Desires Driving All Human Behaviour."
Power involves making people do what they don't want to do. So, you aren't very powerful if you're making children eat a cookie because they do it of their own accord. Therefore, love of power is the love of causing pain insofar as you are the cause of people doing things they wouldn't do if it weren't for your intervening. 
You're right. I was just exploring a counter example of how the "love of power" could potentially translate to more altruistic behavior. 
I think it depends on the context of the "love of power". For instance, if you take the example of a teacher's power over their student, the level of influence they have over a student is their "power". The greatest teachers of all time are the greatest because of the immense influence they have over others. Furthermore, I would assume that most teachers strive to become a better teacher, which translates to increasing the power of their influence/teaching ability. I would say this "love of power" is more altruistic than the kind Russell refers to, but still exists nonetheless.
What do I think of him?? He's.............. meeeehhhhh........ I guess he's alright!
> But if everyone believes it's true, does it really matter if its false?welcome to philosophy
You wrote a whole paragraph about a throwaway phrase and an example that was just meant to be illustrative.It is completely irrelevant whether the boa constrictor actually sleeps or not.  Russell could have said, "imagine there existed an animal who, when it was fully fed, just slept until it needed food.  Humans aren't like that."
I bet they are all tied to those 2 things. 
I guess, but it didn't seem like it was explained that way. I can certainly see how that could be extrapolated from it, but from the way he explained it and the examples he gave, I didn't get that impression. 
He used "Reproduce", I assume to not swear, so I suggested fornicate, which means the same as fuck but isn't crass.
I like this. I'm willing to bet we can map social progress by how enjoyable our needs are.
Desires are biological urges and shaped by natural and sexual selection. Virtue signalling is a strategy to navigate these two realities. Sometimes it's more effective than others.
That criticism turns on the ability of the undefined ears of a "different cultural audience" to recognize soundness rather than the simple question of whether Russel's argument is actually sound itself. It passes the latter test. The former, at least as phrased, is not a test worth taking.If that's the most serious criticism you have, you're miles away from supporting a claim that Russel's excerpt is sophistry.
no, i'm a "both parties are paid by the same lobbyists" guy. i'm a "american voters refusing to vote 3rd party is the core problem of american politics" guy. i'm a "i don't pretend democrats are less evil than republicans just because democrats say they are ok with gays getting married" guy. the two parties are like competing sports teams. no matter who wins, the rules stay the same. 
Indeed, it doesn't exist either, for what matters.The point is, your list is unrealistic mate.
Yeah, the article is clickbait bullshit.  You should read Russell's speech.
I have power over the cookies. The children provide me with the feeling of power as they plead for the cookie. Which is why a grateful society can fulfil power fantasies in a more productive way than a grasping, ungrateful society. Gratitude seems more important than I realised before I wrote this post, actually.
Guess he's just not much of an animal behaviorist. (/s) My point is that he should probably just stick to what he knows, that's all. He had something to say about human behavior, so just stick with that. 
I am not sure that these four desires separate humans from other animals. A lot of other social animals exibit very similar behavior .
You're not wrong exactly, but it kind of ruins the joke. The whole point was to make people think 'fuck' without saying it.
Let's grant that decisions made under duress are decisions from desire.  There is nothing acquisitive about my calling George next door my friend.  My love for the girl from my college isn't necessarily a result of selfishness.  When I worry my brother will get in an accident if he drives has nothing hedonistic about itThe fact is there are plenty of behaviors for me that I can explain without turning to desire.  I don't think I'm unique.  And in that case, Russell is either wrong, or he's making indefensible logical jumps
Why're they my friends? Because I care about them.  I like spending time with them because I care about them.  Why do I help them?  Because I genuinely care about them. It's pretty simple; no need to guess my motives, cuz I'll tell you :)
I've gone deeper than Russell! You see, you can't desire anything if you don't value it! So in reality, evaluation drives all human behavior. Now we just have to categorize the different types of evaluations!Or wait! Deeper still! You can't evaluate anything if you can't *judge* it! And hey what the hell do you know we're back at Kant. Fuck you Russell.
Yep.  I simply call myself an "equal opportunity politician hater."    Get the money out of politics or STFU is my attitude towards washington at this point.  It's become a matter of who is doing better things with their bribes.  
Yes, what you had to say was irrelevant.
Really? I would have imagined it because "fornicate" is such an uncommonly used word it's obviously put in place as a deliberate "look I avoided the swear word you were thinking" candidate.IMO it works better as a joke with "fornicate".
I disagree. When you call your next door neighbor "friend" you are trying to create an alliance to increase your chance of survival because you want to live. Your love for the girl from college has evolved because people that feel love are more likely to have children. If you communicate your anxiety about your brother driving recklessly you're virtue signalling and even if you don't communicate your anxiety then you are still emotionally preparing yourself for the likelihood that he will die in a car crash. 
But why do you care about them? Because you enjoy their society right?
That would make a lot more sense!
Okay, try doing standup
I used to host a stand up show back when I was bartending. It's a good time. Maybe you're right, I should get back into it.
Yes, because the reason I have friends at 15 is so I don't die at 50You realize how ridiculous that sounds, right?
Having friends aids our survival otherwise it would have been selected out. The urge to be among others or the feeling of loneliness wouldn't even exist if it wasn't so. We deal with these feels culturally by propagating the idea of and encouraging the formation of friendship. 
No Country for Old Philosopher-Kings, by Plato McCarthy
Neither Plato nor Socrates necessarily believed all this literally. The point of the dialogue format is that it's multivalent and invites people to think about multiple perspectives rather than authoritatively proclaiming a Truth.
Plato puts aristocracy in the best of light, then timocracy and so on. 
Just to be a devil's advocate, can you provide proof that he is wrong?Edit-It's one of life's great ironies that we have 3,000 years of civilization to look back upon and gain insight from along with the availability of almost any amount of information you could desire at our fingertips and we are actually the most ill-informed and easily fooled than we have ever been.
If someone can tl;dr Plato, and still keep all of the necessary information intact, they'd deserve a literary medal.
That's a narrow view.  Both major parties are *clearly* not monolithic, and there are varying degrees of tyrannical behavior and ideals in each, most of the time Id argue very little (and Im pretty cynical about U.S. govt./politics in general).I dont mean to sound condescending but you should really explore what true tyranny looks like, because it has existed and was far past what the U.S. experiences now.
We're domed or were doomed?:)
Popper is great.  His whole tussle with Wittengstein is an interesting footnote in the history of philosophy.
maybe let the bottom fall out and try to reconstruct it in a better fashion?
bah, the student would probably just read it to pass and secretly hate it unless he already likes philosophy or a professor who knows how to teach it in a way the student understands
It does.  It shows how the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor and the elevation of slaves to citizens is how a tyrant buys popular power.If you don't want tyranny to come from democracy you need to limit wealth redistribution.
That's what authoritarians do.  They want you to believe that they're the only one who can fix all of the problems so that you have to listen to what they say and trust in them and only them.
I don't think anyone is interested in your summary.  I'm wondering what value this judgement has.  This guy has been dead for a while and his works speak for them-self.  What need is there to try and demonize or aggrandize him, rather than just critically analyze his work.
Maybe it was him? Translating ancient Greek was actually his true calling.
After I read that i was waiting for mention of the Bourgeois and class consciousness.
Or this whole post in general? Its quite clear the resulting subject matter is discovered to be Tyranny -> Democracy -> Aristocracy -> Timocracy.The planet ever more so than before has become a global Aristocracy. With democratic and tyrannical governments. So what might you ask is a Timocracy?
Capitalism is not Adam Smith's ideology 
Most of the wealthy in his day would've been aristocrats of some sort, making money off the inherited land they owned rather than setting up an enterprise. There would've been bourgeois to some extent, but very few were as rich as the aristocracy and even the richest bourgeois were generally seen as somewhat lesser.
Senate?Triumvirate?In Plato's Greece?!
Adam Smith thoroughly and rigorously defines capital - it's not hard to define; politicians just like muddying it.  
Good point, it is definitely a strong and relevant interpretation, especially considering your statement in connection to Piketty's studies on the subject. My problem is merely with putting that interpretation into the original text as if it were Plato's own words. You can see that point in my responses to the other replies in this thread.
Interesting, you have any thoughts on what those mechanisms might be?  The very definition of tyranny is the inability to be rid of it easily
better add the shithole of the philippines to that listsince we went fromaristocracyoligarchya broken democracyoh and currently its a baby tyranny  
I'm not yet convinced that term limits are an appropriate check on power. In theory they sound good, but in practice it turns the position into an internship for lobbyists. People don't just disappear after they leave office, they have to make a living somehow.

Thank you very much!
Why so? Was not his tutor, Socrates, executed through a democratic vote by a jury of these ancient Greeks you speak of?
Do you know what's in your best interests, or do you believe that's for someone else to decide?
Well Plato says in The Republic something in line of: Education should be fun, nothing that is taught trough force stays in the soul and in a good environment the cream will rise to the top.
Can't believe this guy teaches people 
> privilegedWoah, you really took Plato down a notch. Brutal! His entire system of philosophy has been fatally destroyed and rendered totally irrelevant. A teenager on reddit just called him privileged. It's over.
to add one more small thing: I've read the Republic in german translation by Schleiermacher and Socrates usually refers to (as you mentioned) to a city and not a huge country. The "republic" (or in german: der Staat) usually refers to something to the scale of today's Berlin, New York or Athens. Even though in the german version the book's name is "Der Staat" or in english "Republic", Socratis still talks about "Stadt" or "City". In today's term we would rather call it "Stadtstaat" or "City state".        
I personally don't vote for a candidate or pick my position on issue solely based on party affiliation.   I don't care if someone is a Democrat or a Republican... I just vote for the person that I feel will be the best choice.  It just seems like there ought to be a better choice than just either/or...   America needs a viable third party(not one that's a clone of the existing two parties, obviously) :)
no apostrophes in user names unfortunately...
Have you come across "1000-Word Philosophy"?
Isn't part of the problem trying to divide something as complex as public opinion along only two party lines?
"The teacher... fawns upon the students" --that's actually in this excerpt! How appropriate. 
Imagine some like super redneck dude with a goatee and big lifted truck with two US flags attached to it getting President.

Noted and you are probably right, but like you said I don't think it changes my point.  His whole deal is paternalistic in nature

Is it a scathing critique of capitalism in ancient democracy or is it The Weeeaaaasssseeeelllll?Weaze the juice buddy
"A spectre is haunting europa"-Plato 
Except we very clearly went from aristocracy to democracy in the past. Timocracy is a sort of warrior elite revering honour and strength above all else, falling into oligarchy (iirc, it's been a while) because some of their leaders start to care more for money than war. It always makes me think of Genghis Khan, or nomadic tribes. 
> Capitalism is not Adam Smith's ideology What are you trying to say here?
> Most of the wealthy in his day would've been aristocrats of some sort, making money off the inherited land they owned rather than setting up an enterprise. Are.... You actually trying to imply that this isn't the case in modern times?
Yes, I agree with your points. And "capitalistic" certainly has the implication of having contributed to the creation of wealth, even if that's rarely the reality of the situation. I wonder if the concept of the "self-made man" was strong in Plato's time.
Tyrannies are rarely completely totalitarian like in 1984, they are usually highly disorganized forms of government in which different factions and power bases are held together by mutual confusion and self-interested acquiescence to the dictator (out of desire for reward and fear of punishment). The dictator's power depends on everyone else's collaboration. So if people simply decide to stop collaborating, for whatever reason, it's possible to make the entire system come apart.
True. People seem to walk into DC as middle class and leave as millionaires a bit too often. It should be civic responsibilty, not a path to riches. Politicians should not be allowed to setup these foundations and engage in pay-to-play...looking at you McCain and Clinton.
Not only that. Plato saw Athenian democracy self-destruct as a result of the Pelopennesian War brought on by the excesses of the Age of Pericles. For Plato democracy means decadence, over-indulgence and rule of the appetitive soul over reason. He sympathized heavily with Sparta and its more oligarchic constitution.
Did you read the Apology? Socrates hardly helped himself while he was on trial.
But he is.
Actually no one really knows what is in our best interest, we don't and never will have complete knowledge so information will always be missing.  People living their daily lives and working their jobs have even less knowledge of the issues than those whose jobs it is to make policy...it's not as simple as you are suggesting
did Aristotle champion democratic rule?  Explain briefly please
Can a teacher not teach his students? Can a father not raise his son?'m sorry that you only experienced negative authoritarianism but some authorities deserve praise and honour. What if the authority is loving and kind? And takes care of your needs?When you take care of an animal, or cat, because it is not intelligent enough to care fot its own food do you lack empathy? We are all in some ways ignorant. Anyboday that unveils the truth out of empathy deserves the highest authorithy in my eyes.
Ah, but the capability of critical thinking is the underlying fundament and the most important part of that. A democracy relies on a sufficiently educated population - or rather, a civilized population, where the average man will trust the words of specialists who clearly know more than him, but still reflect upon said words with the aid of logic, reason, and a bit of self-research.At this point, however, one comes close to a technocracy - which isn't that terrible of an idea. However, I'd say it wouldn't work alone, some sort of political debate would still be needed.
Then mandating everyone reach some minimum education standard shouldn't be part of making quality education available.
I don't insist on equality of outcomes, but equality of opportunity is a worthwhile goal.
IQ means little.  I understand what youre saying but it is a really, *really* terrible form of measuring intelligence.  Even more so that we understand the different "types" of intelligence.  There's also other very important factors like ethics... and sanity.
Not a professor, but it seems like your "political philosophy" class is actually about YOUR political philosophy. 
It's not wrong by any means to point out that his background influenced the direction of his philosophy. And beyond just the blinders of privilege, he even had an active grudge against democracy because the Athenians killed his teacher. Plato can't be considered an unbiased source.Aristotle, otoh, was much fairer to democratic constitutions due to his own background and projects.
I agree, but to compare our circumstances tyranny is beyond exaggeration.
I guess I have, now that you just mentioned it ;-). Do they contextualize it with modern-day examples as well, or is it a "Reader's Digest" version of philosophy.
You're right, of course. I think I'm a little more worried because of the extreme polarization, which has been going on for some time now really. This last election had been a strange one, and not just because of Donald Trump. Something very different has happened, and it is impossible to judge an event that you are in the midst of. But the checks and balances have been holding up.
Yeah I would say so...they are not comprehensive enough to include the wide spectrum of thought that is present.  However they do prevent the system from being "over-democratic" and unworkable through paralysis (even though that is exactly what is happening anyway)
I am afraid you are right.  Just the idea that he was seen as a viable president speaks volumes about where the voters' heads are at.
but there's literally nothing to suggest he'll do that anymore than any other U.S. president.
You made me laugh off my chair dude.
S/he is trying to say the phrase "I don't think it is clear that the meaning intended by the translation is meant to refer literally to an ideology tracing back to Adam Smith" makes little sense, because 'Capitalism' isn't an ideology that can be traced back to Adam Smith anyway.
Yeah. Most of the richest people in the modern world made their wealth through business and started off life far poorer(that's not to say poor, but middle class is a lot poorer than millionaire or billionaire).The traditional idea of one family's wealth going up through time due to the increasing value of their land is largely antiquidated. Yes, families still make money off of that, but all the real wealth is created through enterprise and selling goods and services, rather than just renting land to those who do.
In the US, this is the duty of the Congress and supreme Court through impeachment 
I agree...but we will have tryanny when the people willingly concede those rights to the state, so far we are ok. But I can see a future where some people are fanatical enough in their support of someone to give those rights up to make his job easier...the seeds are being sowed right now actually
It should be no surprise then that the exact same 'we need a strong man' myth and 'bureaucracy is stifling progress' arguments were made by Mussolini's Facist party back in the '20s.
It's spot on because it doesn't misinterpret Plato.
> For Plato democracy means decadence, over-indulgence and rule of the appetitive soul over reasonThis is terrifyingly relevant in our times.
TBH I can admit having this bias as well when I first read Plato. Athens is still seen as the "platonic ideal" of a Greek city-state [sorry]. So much of ancient Greek culture is seen through this Atheno-centric lens, especially philosophy, theater & mythology.
Taking the piss and annoying everybody shouldn't earn you a death sentence. That's kinda the whole point.
Seems more like they're suggesting that despite knowing that, you'd probably still assume your personal knowledge is important enough to warrant you having personal choice over your being. It isn't simple, but would you rather not have a choice about it despite still having to live through it?It's hard to argue it's right to give away control over the self to others if you can't do it yourself.
Time is limited and attention spans short. Even shorter due to online gaming (immediate gratification and such), as well as confirmation bias being rife within online echo chambers. It makes group-think much easier than thinking for oneself.
This question will never have an acceptable answer.
And they defer us to legal drug dealers, and often without much debate.
its deeper than that, plato is all about perfection and spirituality (perfect forms and all that) whereas Aristotle is the consummate materialist. for Plato men are supposed to free themselves from the cave and rise to the good whereas for Aristotle the truth lay in empiricism and exploration. So  devolving into politics Plato's idea of philo kings with gold  in their hearts is anathema to Aristotelian ideas.
Equating any of those relationships you listed with the one between the individual and the state is a false equivalency.You're assuming that my desire to be taken care of and to be relatively comfortable trumps my desire to be free and to know that everyone I will ever meet will have the same level of personal autonomy as I do. I'm not a pet to be kept in a gilded cage. I am a human being.  What exactly do you mean by "the truth" I wonder, the way you describe it nothing short of the messiah of all humankind would have access to it. 
>What have we done sinceBroke down traditional role models and stereotypes, which resulted in a society freer than any other in history. Created the internet, a piece of technology more important, complex and beneficial than the works of every philosopher in all of history combined. Built machines that eased the lives of millions if not billions. >Politicians slashed the space budgetBecause we realized that the moon is pretty boring all things considered. 
I never understood why technocracy is seen in a bad light automatically.  I think there is some virtue to it
Elaborate. Leaders must understand extremely complicated issues with thousands of moving parts. What makes someone with a sub-80 IQ capable of understanding it? Also, would you draw any conclusions from the fact that countries with very low average IQs are less likely to be democracies? 
Welcome to college! Professors stake out a position and defend it from students that have no chance. 
> The insight that his background may somehow be related to his philosophy is...rare here, I see.No. It's not rare and you're not special. It's just that you clearly have zero knowledge of Plato's "background" if you think it's his "privilege" which formed his views.
yes, I guess tyranny is too strong a word.  I'm just saying there there should be other choices besides Democrats and Republicans.   
Not sure, I've come across their articles before but I don't know their range. Glancing at it now, it looks like they are mostly on modern topics.
True, but it also shows a society full of individuals. Whether people like to admit it or not, diversity is high and people think for themselves nowadays. The pack mentality as described through traditional terms (Republican, Democrat, independent) is not as cut and dry as it used to be.
You're right, lots of Presidents have openly questioned the legitimacy of courts which rules against them.  Typically after declaring the press to be an opposition party, but before appointing department heads who are openly hostile towards their own departments. 
That is pretty catastrophic. Maybe it's just because I've grown up in a society that has been relatively stable for much longer than I've been in it, but I really can't see something that extreme happening to America or other modern countries. However, it does seem like we're heading toward a violent confrontation of ideologies in America, what with the ramping up of violence in "political" demonstrations.
Imagine if one of them made it to the White House!
You haven't sorted this out.  Is the point that Adam Smith didn't come up with the word or concept of capitalism?  Or that Adam Smith's ideology is not inline with capitalism?
Who do you attribute the ideology of capitalism to?
Is the point that Adam Smith didn't come up with the word or concept of capitalism? Or that Adam Smith's ideology is not inline with capitalism?
well depending very heavily on the nation. In the US for example wealth lasts rarely more than two or three generations. The richest family in Venice is literally 700 years old. It's kind of ironic that someone complains about the use of *capital* in a  translation of the Greeks as anachronistic and then does not see the blindspot by projecting the American history of wealth distribution onto it. Got to be a little careful here
I'd argue that the impeachment process for the chief executive has a minimal role of the Supreme Court - the courts only role here is that the Chief Justice presides over the Trial, but the greater of your points is absolutely true
That is the mechanism, the problem is there's enough prats that would look for any old excuse for a fight.
He very narrowly was found guilty and then, when it came time to argue for what the punishment should be, he managed to convince the entire jury that he deserved the death penalty.
I guess we as a society (and it's probably where we have failed by the biggest margin) need to get to a place where our own desires aren't the number one priority.  This passage alone describes how when people get entitled they stop accepting the legitimacy of democracy and turn to a "protector" of their ideals which becomes a tyranny
Do you hear me blaming them? How am I being classist?  I am saying it is not practical to expect them to know all relevant information regarding issues...stop making a strawman argument about what I am saying
Greatest good for the greatest number seems to be a solid way to go. However arriving at what that is and how to implement it... whole different ballgame
I suppose it could be broken down to metaphysics versus materialism, but anyone who argues that the limits of thought can be broken down into Aristotelian or Platonic trajectories is trying to blinker you to the wider spectrum.
It's interesting that you prop up the internet above works of philosophy.  We are seeing the bearing of fruit from having information without wisdom. So I have to respectfully disagree. 
IQ correllates with level and quality of education.Id wager we've already had multiple heads of state with sub-80 IQs (which is again... a basically worthless measure of intelligence, problem solving, interpersonal skills, etc.) in the developed world in the last 50 years.  This is why they have advisors, councils, etc.  They can specialize and present issues in a digestible form to the head of state.  Obviously Id prefer that person to be smarter, but I think you put a bit too much emphasis on one ingredient of a recipe.
You loves you some you, huh?
Which could ultimately be a good thing if we move away from the paradigm we have had and come up with something better.  Honestly the fact that he wasn't disqualified could mean that candidates down the line who actually would be good leaders won't get disqualified for petty stuff anymore like Howard Dean's yell.  Can you believe in retrospect that that took down a presidential candidate?
It would be some wacky and wild science fun!
Oh, how I wish that required imagination!
Yeah, I think there's a Plato/Aristotle distinction in terms which may be confusing things.
The former.You only say something can be "traced back" to someone if that person could be said to have started it.Like you wouldn't say witches and wizards could be 'traced back' to JK Rowling, right?
No specific person 
Smith certainly thought benevolence was a virtue.But I wonder what view it is exactly that you attribute to Smith when you say he is ideologically capitalist? There seems to me to be no contradiction between thinking altruism virtuous and supporting a free market including ownership and exchange of capital.Also as a side note, while Smiths sentimentalism does share some commonalities with utilitarianism, it definitely is not equivelant to utilitarianism.
I was doing the exact opposite. I was saying that the wealth distribution and who the wealthy were was radically different in Ancient Greece. 
Ya you make a good point, only the chief justice is involved 
Which is the point.  He was a citizen that respected the law even when it meant his own demise.
But we do live in a society where people don't always act in their own best interest. And thank Gord for that. Can you imagine what society would look like if we all acted in our own best interests all the time? We're not hardwired to be sociopaths, we're pack animals. And this isn't the result of "if I did that the police would take me away." There's a reason we are wary of sociopaths, and we could build a society where they were marginalised, instead of lauded. 
And why are you assuming that people automatically have wisdom?  That is a dangerous assumption as well
Man will mostly act mutually towards others. In most situations, it is unreasonable to intentionally harm others, and the desire (or its outcome) is by itself often enough difficult to argue for.Conflicts of interest are solved by cooperation or avoidance, not hostility. In the matter of others being ignorant for what is good for themselves, one should make attempts to inform them, or rather, *educate them*. Education is profoundly important for all things in modern society, from simple knowledge about the world to becoming a civilized, reflective, and **humane** being.
One of the most frustratingly beautiful elements of philosophy is that it is at its best when a premise can not be answered or universally agreed upon.
Do you have an opinion on Carl Schmitt? I was introduced over a decade ago and have been noticing a trend in discourse I think is attributed to his work.
Times are always changing. I think we're in a unique state of reality that will not last in this climate. It's just too volatile. It's my hope at least.
From what little I know, it seems to me OP is using the definitions from Aristotle's typology 
Who do you trace our understanding of capitalism to?
Who developed the capitalistic theory?  Everyone here is saying it predates Smith.>Bringing up Marx because he coined the term is pretty darn shallow.Lord I hope you are not speaking to me.
I think you are saying Smith didn't invent capitalism, because I don't think you are saying Smith didn't give a treatise on how our global markets work in relation to "capital". And I am not sure if someone before him gave anywhere near such an indepth inquiry on the subject.
As well as the fact that how we use utilitarianism is pretty arbitrary, in that it is inherently a moralistic doctrine. The good of an action is valued above else, however who determines what is good or bad is open to interpretation and probably dependent on the zeitgeist. 
are you talking about the theory of moral sentiments?  Because I've read it, have you?
You don't seem to have gotten the point. The guy who started the comment chain was offended by the idea of using "capitalistic" as a term to describe the ancient Greek economy, because he argues capital in modern capitalist economies is fleeting and dynasties are not typical. Responding to this I say that this is only true in the United States. In many European countries, including Greece capital very much exists in patrimonial form and as such can be used for the translation without a problem. OP is unconsciously universalising his American idea of fast paced rag-tag capital.   
Germany hasn't ceded their manufacturing base or jobs and they're doing just fine as a regional power. And their middle class is very strong.
You can't gerrymander a state, those borders have existed for longer than most voters have been alive. It is plausible to blame gerrymandering for why Republicans control the House but if you think that gave Republicans the Senate or the Presidency, you are mistaken.
We are increasingly becoming intolerant of that shared responsibility view of our society though...
You can't possibly look at our culture right now and conclude that we are altruistic.  Sure there are examples of it all over the place but that is not the outlook dominating our politics at the moment
I know, it seduces me and pisses me off interchangeably
I have used Schmitt extensively in my own work, and teach him. On Dictatorship was recently translated to English so now it's very valuable for undergraduates. I used to have to use the *Concept of the Political,* which is a far inferior text.
I don't know. You can make a case for Marx I guess, since he 'invented' the word. "Understanding" is pretty vague though - there is no consistent understanding of capitalism. Mine is different to mine 6 months ago, let alone to someone else on earth at some point in human history.So I'd be wary of saying it can be "traced back" to anyone, but if you're going to say that then Marx is the only name that seems defensible to me.
Perhaps, but I'd be wary of saying "Existentialism is an ideology that can be traced back to Kierkegaard", wouldn't you?I mean every idea can be traced back to other ideas. But giving Adam Smith 'ownership' of a word he never used seems ridiculous to me. If you're going to say capitalism can be 'traced back' to anyone (which I wouldn't), I'd say Marx is the name to use.
Oh I must have replied to the wrong guy, some other dude brought up Marx.Who is saying it predates Smith exactly? You must be reading a different thread.No one really came up with capitalistic economic theory, loads of people came up with loads of concepts which coalesced into it. Smith happened to be (one of) the first. I should have formulated that part of my previous post better.
I went to a conference on the book.  Lots of people wrote their dissertation on that book.  Interesting stuff.  Smith was obsessing over the book even years after originally writing it.
i mean the guy that originally said smith's ideology is not capitlaism
I thoroughly support that decision
But the jobs never left in the first place.  Once those jobs left America they weren't coming back.  Capitalists sold us down the riber and now we blame the politician...the anger is misplaced
I'm saying that the chokehold that republicans have doesn't have to do with them appealing to more people. It has to do with how voting works. There's a reason that Dems won the popular vote,and that is fear. People in the country are afraid and so they vote against any change. This is disproportionately represented in the government bc of the electoral college. Country folk don't produce as much and are dragging the rest of the country backwards. 
I would actually go even further to say that culturally, there is a growing number of people who will not only be self-seeking in their behavior, but purposefully depriving others of that ability in order to increase.We are definitely not an altruistic culture.
...I'm the undergrad who never had any philosophy before college. So I went in to those lectures "still in the cave"...and I've been quoting TCOTP since. Thanks for the heads up!
>  there is no consistent understanding of capitalism.Ok, so are you saying that Smith's ideology wasn't capitalistic in nature?  > Mine is different to mine 6 months ago, let alone to someone else on earth at some point in human history.I'm also confused one what this means.  You are saying there is no accepted definition for capitalism? And regardless if there is, yours is different from it?
Listen.  A plethora of posts have appeared that are implying that Smith did not define capitalism, and that he was altruistic and socialist.  You implied capitalism was defined post smith, and these posters are suggesting it was done pre smith.Apparently no one here has read smith but me, and no one is putting up any references of any previous writers defining capitalism.>You must be reading a different thread.You are lost and you admitted in your post.  Go read everything again.
Sorry are you saying now you haven't read it?  It is interesting, but I am worried about peoples views on what they think the implications are.
You aren't saying in this sentence that he called for altruism.  But you are implying it.  Do you agree this would be in direct contrast to the implicate conclusion of TWON?
I think you are saying here, that by increasing or pursuing utility, one increases their contribution to the common good?
Because it's politicians that signed the free trade acts that allowed the jobs to leave in the first place, and gutted union protections and allowed corporations to bankrupt themselves to discharge pension obligations so that CEOs could give themselves record pay.All of that stuff is solvable at the government level.
Gerrymandering doesn't turn a minority into a majority. Gerrymandering just turns a slight majority into a very big majority, as well as producing extremely "safe" districts.  The senate has issues because it's not population based. If you combine gerrymandering with voter suppression, you might have a way for a minority to dominate, but part of that could be a symptom of overall political apathy, where people just don't go and vote. 
I agree.  See my previous posts.  
Public life is increasingly being seen as a zero sum game, it's similar outlook to the fascists of the 30's and their view of winners and losers and how they were the winners who crush the losers.
I understand. Thanks for the clarification
I had my niece and nephew over today,  my wife took them to church because their mother won't let us have them over unless we take them to church.  When they got home they were telling my wife all the things you need to do to go to heaven,  after their list I asked how they knew that was true and they just stared at me dumbfounded  like they're not used to beliefs being questioned. This article is exactly what I've been looking for. 
What was her explanation? Would love to hear it
Books like Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder are great for pre/early teens and upwards, and I'm sure there are lots of other books on philosophy that make the subject accessible to pretty much any audience you want. But I agree with you, it needs to be taught by a Philosophy specialist like any other distinct subject, and not like an oddly specific history lesson or off shoot of English. Arguably it has more to do with science then any other subject.
Yup. Philosophers are behind the greatest movements in history. 
A life raft isn't a cureall when you're stranded in the middle of the ocean, but without one you will certainly drown.
Maybe this points out the validity of an earlier poster, that may be we as a society want or value critical thinkers. Revolutionaries are dangerous people. We want people to have the ability of read, write and be numerate, but maybe not much beyond that. Even those who study a STEM subject, how many really think about what they are learning and just act as sponge because that is more economically prudent thing to do.
Teach Theory of Knowledge to International Baccalaureate students.
You mean not as easily manipulated.Advertising still works even if you know how it works.Placebos work, even when you know it's a placebo.We were all born with all the basic instincts, emotions and general wiring of the evolution branch we evolved on.
Dune by Frank Herbert
Ignorance is bliss. I learned that at age 20 after watching some of those clips from the Middle East. People refuse to believe what'd right in front of them. 
What study?
children can be capable of concrete operational thought
I have a feeling your niece/nephew's mom isn't going to like that.
One of the things I do to get past taking offense at the question is to rephrase it out of genuine curiosity instead of criticism.  So I'll open with something like "you know, I'm curious.  Can you tell me why you believe that?"  Most people don't get offended at that question but most people also can't articulate why they believe what they believe.
where did that come from and what is your train of thought? 
Impissedimology is more like it.The number of trivial things people hold onto like the last bit of water in a desert...no reasoning with them because of anger.
Unfortunately, people prefer evidence.
Wait, what? What is the story here?
"What? You don't trust me?"
One of the required classes for my philosophy major was a class on logic where we went over all the formal and informal fallacies.  Also we spent the first day in several of my classes going over structured arguments, identifying the propositions, and examining the logical inferences.  So yes, it teaches people how to think rationally.
Basically humans in general. So Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, [insert any platform including human activity here].
I'd totally forgotten about this book. Remember a class that used this book when I was around 13 and it was a fantastic introduction. 
I have long suggested logic should be introduced alongside mathematics. Reason and critical thinking skills are foundational pieces that have been missing from early childhood development. 
And the greatest non movements. My brother in law. Are you ever going to use that degree to get off my couch, Chad?!"
Possibly their physics education was more about working through problems, learning various facts, etc. rather than approaching a question from various different angles, talking about the pros and cons of different approaches, reflecting on what sorts of reasons are convincing reasons and why these are convincing reasons, reflecting on the reasons for the answers to all of the above questions, etc.
Out of curiosity, what did you study in university? I wish to hear more about your thoughts. 
Sounds like money. 
> Even those who study a STEM subject, how many really think about what they are learning and just act as sponge because that is more economically prudent thing to do.We're taught to question everything we learn. Nothing is true until proven and no question should be left unexplored if unable to be explained by other means.
Very few in and of itself, to be frank, but it's an exceptional springboard for the mind when actually applying yourself toward a more "employable" skill due to the way it gears your mind (e.g. much more analytical, more settled about the kind of work you actually *want* to be doing and how you do it etc.).As /u/snuffybox said - law is often a natural next step.
who are you??
I should have said ***some*** atheists and ***some*** conservative religionists. I am going to go out on a limb and guess you have a problem with religion on some level, bad experience personally?
your gripe is that he said "not manipulated as easily" instead of "not as easily manipulated?"
The logic classes I took were more mathematical logic classes. If A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. Heavy on the syntax. That was more what I was advocating for. I do not believe that type of class suffers either of the drawbacks you just describe. If I am mistaken, and you had a class that was more mathematical in mind for those statements, I would be very interested in further explanation. 
The title is an empirical claim, that should be supported by evidence, but I don't know how I would go about measuring it. The article doesn't mention it. 
"So God is really great, yes Johnny?"   -"Yes, mommy says God can do everything!"  "But there are also bad people doing bad things in this world.."  -"I don't like bad things.."  "So if God can do everything, why doesn't he stop bad things?  -"uhh.."  "God cannot stop the evil, so he's not all powerful and not worthy of worship, or he let's evil happen anyway, and why would you worship an evil God?"  -"I want to go home, uncle bob ;___;"
Connections are the driving force of success in every society. It is what makes it a society.
I think this is an overly cynical view point. If schooling has been corrupted so that it's just to create conforming workers for society why do they even teach math and English and really any subject that is not immediately practical. If school really was set up to purposely turn us into worker drones it's done a pretty shit job of it consderijg how many people blatantly hate working and how anti capitalist the average person is 
I hope that is true. The biggest problem education has in the UK is not it's ambition, but rather its implementation. ie "Show your critical thinking skills by giving us the right answer." Proscription in assessment destroys real imagination.
Obviously cases will be different for different people, and age groups. 
Can you give some examples? Not doubting you just wondering what sort of things they teach.
I don't know where it came from, but I can follow it up. In some of my past conversations, I've brought up philosophical or ethical questions in a fairly non-rigorous manner, but still some people tell me I'm depressing or they'll just blatantly say "I don't think about stuff like that."  On the other hand, some of my most cherished moments with friends from college involved quite a bit of philosophizing.  So it really depends on who you are with!
It happens when people abandon the arts and humanities as sources of truth.
I don't think that's true for even 50% of the population at large.
Just another idiot who would rather be right than happy.
I'm happy to hear that ToK was such an influential course for you. The teacher has so much bearing on the course, so that's great that you had a good one. As a teacher, I'm lucky to have a great class. We have some awesome discussions, and most of the kids are interested. Best of luck to you in your medical career! 
Well, a lot of people think philosophy is "dumb" or "useless", so it's not surprising that some students didn't find the class appealing.  However, ToK is one of the core subjects for IB and very important to the program, so I'm not sure why the students felt it wasn't important.
Same author has a book named The Solitaire Mystery, which is not as explicit about discussing philosophy as Sophie's World although that is exactly what it does.I read it when I was 12(ish) and really enjoyed it.
Also, I'm sick of CS students who can't understand under what conditions a certain branch is taken...And no, I'm not joking. I wish I was.
I see a problem with our need to test and evaluate students at all levels, since this process would be organic and rather messy, just like real education, which is not suited to bureaucratic score keeping.
Philosophers and Philosophy Majors (while not mutually exclusive) are not the same thing. 
I guess you're trolling, but as a personal ignoramus myself, I was stunned by how much the Greek philosophers lead us out of the world of superstition, and into the age of reason. (sic). It sent religion scampering to the corners of reason for scraps, and allowed the development of scientific thinking which transformed the world. I wish politicians were philosophers... Marketeers are business people and lawyers are sophists.
Computer Engineering.Propositional and predicate calculus, the basis of rigorous reason, are covered. That's pretty much all you need really - even mathematics sticks to first order logic.And to be frank, formal logic is really only useful when checking arguments (don't get me wrong it's interesting and all), you don't really need to be taught it to reason correctly - reasoning is an innate ability of most humans; with some people being better at it than others.
I feel like this is an under rated post, it explains a lot IMO. But I don't think its the "best" parts that split off, but the parts that had real world applicability/impact. All that is left are the bits that have little real world applicability.
Hmm yeah I can't read.
Welcome to philosophy, empirical evidence isn't considered here.
So you agree that they shouldn't be especially for American society. Yet some Americans sure seem to believe they are.
Poor parenting can leave scars and habits that extend well into your adulthood. Becoming an adult doesn't magically clean the baggage from your past. That being said, having a good excuse to blame your behavior on your past doesn't mean you should. Part of being an adult is coming to terms with the past so you can have a future. 
I agree. It's not like when planning curriculum, they consider how to brainwash children into mindless workers. How does that even benefit them?
Except for the whole having to teach to the test or your rating as a teacher gets destroyed thing.
Much as I hate the regiment of school (I even home school my son) you are insightful in your comment. This idea of "drone" is due to rampant individualism, so that only immigrants to our country will work at many jobs, such as care and factory work. all our children grow up believing themselves to good for this, whilst simultaneously becoming incapable of anything else. tl;dr schools are doing a bad job of creating drones. or thinkers.
You're absolutely right. They encourage critical thinking at secondary school, but at the end of the day it was still a regurgitation of what we were taught. If I was doing an essay, rather than critically evaluating based upon my own thoughts, it was "give us exactly what we want to know and make it look like you've come to this conclusion through deduction, not because this is what was drilled into you repeatedly." The critical evaluation is an afterthought if anything. 
But, these sentiments come directly from a culture that devalues critical thinking.
This statement has so many problems.
But true for 100% of Reddit ahahahaha.
I guess sometimes two people just aren't compatiblists.
>I guess that's true, what's the point of life if not to enjoy it, in whatever way gives you the most enjoyment.There is no point to life other than what's derived from the physical world around us.  What is meaningful to you is utterly pointless, what is interesting to you is stupid, what is fun to you is annoying - all depending on the listener.  
Oh his is very true.  I think being cognizant of your own potential stupidity is the best you can do in today's engineering environment.This is a speculative and kind of abstract conversation, I just remember a lot of annoying conversations people tried to push onto me as "interesting".   Like the environmental scientist who - in senior year - finally realized that wind turbine blades were "wings"
I think it's because you could only get 1 to 3 points out of it and only if you also do well on your extended essay. I really wonder why people think philosophy is "dumb" or "useless" as you say - this kind of attitude always annoyed me.
It separates the men from the boys. I wouldn't get paid what I do if it were an easily acquired skill. A friend of mine still hasn't fully grasped IF and loops. He views the syntax in a literal manner. I've seen things like IF-WHILE and SWITCH-WHILE (for reasons you can probably guess). When he asked why he can't do that, I told him that that is simply not the syntax for this language (Java). I've seen some creative code. 
I think truth tables and sets are as important as Algebra. It's difficult to get high schoolers interested in anything they don't consider valuable *right now*. That doesn't change a discipline's importance in education. 
Tenets. Fundamental tenets.
Chad should take up welding. 
"It sent religion scampering to the corners of reason for scraps, and allowed the development of scientific thinking which transformed the world"Careful with this, mysticism took a hit, but religion in general wasn't defeated. Isaac newton, the father of modern science and the modern scientific method, professed religion to be the driving force for his discoveries. "To think God's thoughts after him". Same with Kepler, the father of modern astronomy, and others.
Well ... technically pure mathematics has no real world application ... it's still under the mathematics department rather than philosophy.
>signify their agreement and value of the original comment with something beyond the numerical "upvote".Granted, but it's the *least possible* contribution beyond an upvote. In a medium with myriad gradations of expression, it's a paucity.
What? The reason we form societies is for connections. A group of people who are well connected can always accomplish more than an individual. Building relationships and trust is what allows us to be more than the sum of our parts.Can it be abused? Of course. *Everything* can be abused.
I do. I wish I had worded it differently, but yes, /u/Aisthetiks makes a fair point.
Mainly thinking of the less serious things like abuse etc. Agreed on both accounts. 
1) How is what Russell said 100 years ago about Britain relevant to us today? 2) Bertrand Russell can still be wrong, after all the educations system did produce thinkers such himself
what if you replace they with we
Can you define "incomplete political dominance"?
This sounds like something someone would say if they had never been to graduate school. I mean, I've never thought as you do, but if did it wouldn't have lasted past the first week.
Eh - I disagree. It certainly happens I know, but in my experience the teachers who I had who had *discussions* in class about the topics being taught ended up translating into better overall grades and attitude in the class.
That is sad. I am currently studying Molecular Biology at a solid school because of my freshman year of high school Biology teacher. I even went to school in the deep south..
It is almost as if the people setting up these tests lack critical thinking skills...
Ha! It's very interesting when people with a *lot* of knowledge in a subject don't know something that is very common within that subject, makes you realize how easy it is to  miss something.
Thank you. I'll have been saying it that way for years.
Funnily enough, that would make him a good bit of coin. 
Metaphorically scampering for reason, certainly not even diminished.The Catholic church is probably the author of the big bang theory, they were not such an unreasonable religion by then. But...The capacity to think critically and engage without prejudice is available to religion just as it is to everyone else. If you recall that Galileo fell foul of the Church, and most science was decried as witch craft (Newton was skating a dangerous path with his dabbling in Alchemy). Just because religious men could not deny their belief in God did not prevent them from observing rationally.
Why does everything need to be a meaningful contribution? Sometimes you just want to be heard and let someone know how much something resonated with you.You could use that same logic against people who say thank you. What utilitarian purpose does gratitude have beyond just letting someone know you appreciate them? 
So is it abused? Of course. Everything is abused.
Good :) your mentality will take you far, my friend.
Id say people are not easily manipulated unless they want to. People want to be manipulated so they can reap the rewards. They promise to end their fears for them like a church to the sinful and to have their backs like a mafia to a petty criminal. To question is to die alone. 
A culture isn't so much taught as it is made through social interaction, rather it is ingrained and shaped and molded over you. You aren't taught in schools to be a drone, you are molded into one subtly because you are expected to fall into a certain pattern of behavior and failing to do so will, at least in your mind, and indeed often in reality, will lead to you being ostracized.
Gold star for this guy
But such teacher's often fall behind on the curriculum doing that.  I used to have a history teacher like this.  We used to joke that he would be absent and let a substitute come and get us caught up, because there were no "time wasting" discussions with the substitute.
I'll get through it. I'm not going to let it turn me away from studying something I love just because someone is too stupid to figure out something about the world around them. (I want to study astrophysics, by the way. Or ... Just cosmology in general.
double post my bad
I'm grappling with that concept myself. I think it's the width as well as the depth of reading you do. Rather than studying the entirety of a topic, you're assigned an incredibly specific topic to read into significantly and get as many stances and viewpoints as possible during that time. Rather than "analyse Hegel's Philosophy of Right", it's "is Hegel's theory of justice retributive or consequentialist in Philosophy of Right" for example. 
It's nice to see people who can admit it though.  I try not to open my mouth until the last possible second; sometimes it's sometimes it just hasn't "clicked" and I'll get it once I can sit at my desk and think.  But in a field where you're mostly making armchair decisions, being dumb is really only bad when you can't admit it
You're a thread killer stfu
> Sometimes you just want to be heard and let someone know how much something resonated with you.It resonated so much, it inspired heartfelt lines of poetry like "This.">You could use that same logic against people who say thank you.I'm not sure about that. In fact, I think substituting "Thank you." wouldn't have generated the same negative response.
> To question is to die alone.^ Profound truth in a nutshell.There are "safe" questions, and there are questions that cannot be asked without people shunning you. They hate it when you try to challenge their views by asking "why do you think that way?". It's like they hate thinking.Sometimes, I question if I think too much :p
If you have a good lecturer then sure. With the mass production of University education that aspect can be lost. (in UK at least). I remember writing an essay "Show how X is different to everything else" where I quoted lots of top software gurus saying "It's Not". I got a crap mark for a really good essay.X was "Object Orientation", in case you were curious.
Yes, many essay questions narrow down, though the assumption is you have a broad enough reading to contextualise the question and a specific enough reading to give a detailed and nuanced answer. This is possible (I got a First), but the reality is that learning to find and sort the data intelligently (aka survey technique) is not the same as understanding the data (aka analysis and knowledge).
Truth is the explanation that best helps you sleep at night.
I always talk about a subject and project as much as possible, because I figure that people like to correct mistakes more than they like to give you new knowledge in the first place. The more I talk, the higher the chances are of me saying something not true, than quickly someone corrects me... to which I profusely thank them for teaching me something new. It works wonders because not only did I learn something, but the other person is now validated for knowing that in the first place.
I think you're making the mistake in thinking people only comment for your entertainment. That's just a byproduct. We're social creatures that like to socialize, that's why we do this.>I'm not sure about that. In fact, I think substituting "Thank you." wouldn't have generated the same negative response.Are we talking about popularity or depth?
I do History & Politics, a lot of the politics I do is political philosophy so this is my bread and butter. 
Precisely. Very well put. 
That is such a cop out. A notion of truth that depends on individual preferences is a real mockery of the idea of truth.
>Are we talking about popularity or depth?'Thank you' has more depth than 'this'. That's my point, that you *can't* "use that same logic" for both.
Yeah, I can see how you express yourself succinctly, I am aware of rambling around to make my point. I am going to copy your previous post into notebook so I can use it to make my point better!
Cool. We agree. I was just kind of talking about there's this whole degree, called Bachelor of the Arts, that is based upon classical thought rather than STEM. When I said arts and humanities, what I really meant was a complete liberal arts education, which is really just comparative study of everything.
Cause it's pretty easily to connect everything to existentialism
That's not what is being suggested as the story arc. OP proposes that the character arc of Rick is developing a way to be happy even while knowing nothing matters, without retreating to some false meaning. 
IIRC the end of that essay is "one might imagine Sisyphus happy." which doesn't necessarily mean he's found meaning, it could be interpreted that he has reached a state of acceptance of the absurd and revels in the meaningless turmoil of life.
Xavier: Renegade Angel is another great one. 
I think you nailed why I like Rick & Morty so much, by comparing it to my favorite philosopher.
Hahahah I can attest, watched the series 3x through and it has challenged my philosophical tendencies each watch through lol
Do you really think so? I just looked at their channel page and in the last six months they made about ~45 Videos, 5 of which were about R&M.I would hardly call that 'the only thing they do'.
He *is* the Rickest Rick.
Hulu has it. 
It also makes it uninteresting. The idea that reality doesn't have a built in obvious answer, so you just have to do stuff is one of exactly two options, and is taken almost as a given in modern day. Like sure, there are particular things to say about it, but to anyone who has watched / read more than one video like this, the fact that they describe the same basic existentialism facts, but then say its part of a different series gets redundant after awhile when nothing else is mentioned.
I read all of that as one title at first
Well not exactly Nazi ideology, just theories made by a literal Nazi.AoT's ideas and values were pretty common in the late 19th century, which the series is roughly based on.
More about how season 2 finale dangles the switch from absurdism to existentialism but season three trolls us and goes full force absurdism. You were really close though. 
> aneurism Absurdism? Absurdism might not be the exact same thing as existentialism, but its a similar umbrella about meaning in life, and responding to this vague ambiguity. These aren't totally uninteresting things to talk about the themes of something, but it seems like a huge portion of philosophy of x things just aren't sure what to talk about and default to this. So it gets a little redundant since it feeds into stereotypes of philosophy as not really being about anything but "the meaning of life."
I see that now, you're right. The message was muddied by having one of the last lines of the video highlight how Rick doesn't care about his family and isn't learning to be compassionate. Made everything seem reductive. 
Yes, it is possible you may not enjoy the podcast. Also, psychology says we all think we are smarter than we are, he is probably just in a position that exploits that. Over 200 episodes his views have evolved a lot, so while I agree with your narcisissist condemnation, there is solid proof that he changes opinions and views based on mostly current social affairs. 
Pop nihlism is a great way to put it. My friend said it addresses deep concepts, I pointed out it's not addressing them so much as exploiting them.
I'm pretty sure Camus does explicitly state in the essay what I previously said. Could be wrong, will check on it later, but I don't think I am.
Don't forget Dr Steve Brulee
how is that a bad thing? or contradictory to any of what anybody said
Investigate 3/11
No problem, glad you enjoyed it as much as I did. I'm admittedly new to the Wisecrack channel, any videos in particular you would recommend watching from them?
Camus was a bitter opponent of existentialism and a major critic of both Dostoyevsky and Sartre...
Wh.. wha.. what? After all these years.. it can't really be you 
Yeah only the Rick and Morty ones make it to the front page tho, so that's why he thinks they make just R&M videos
I didn't forget, I just think that's an excuse.
Why would rick give morty his collar then (s2e1)? If that were true, 10 times out of 10 rick just puts it on himself and gets a new morty if he doesn't actually care.
Careful, friend. This is how it has to be. Don't let it grind you too much. If you feel uneasy or believe yourself headed toward your own crisis, change your lens!
Rick is actually an egotist. Every single one of his actions supports this. We thought he betrayed that when he turned himself in to save his family, but we saw that was just a ruse in the season 3 opener. 
Haha thanks. I've thrown this example around with my friends before when they talk about how deep Rick and Morty is and it's usually met with blank stares. Maybe I will if you promise not to use it as homework lol 
Would you sacrifice your genitals if the utilitarian calculus showed that it would save hundreds of billions of lifeforms? (Inter-dimensional cable 2)  
Green eyes. The blonde hair is the only similarity, seems like a stretch to me
9 more seasons
No worries. Way to be open to shit!
Really? I haven't seen it yet. Thanks.
I'm pretty sure the philosophy isn't why people watch and love the show. The show's persistent shittalking and utter disregard for reverence is pretty consistently the main draw for the majority of fans I've spoken with. The nihilism and existentialism is just the vessel.
That's because the internet thinks everything is nihilism.
Oh yeah it won't really, my comment was mostly me expressing my frustration with internet fandom. When I watch it with friends we don't divulge in "this is deep" so I'm still content. :)
They're advertising a brand? Not a sauce. 
For what? You didn't produce that video did you?
I don't think being busy for busy sake or level of activity is the innate subconscious goal. I think it has more to do with having control or conversely losing control. Overall the lazy man would rather be effective than be busy or lazy or whichever conserves energy and increases output the most. However effective *and* lazy may be energy conservation at its finest.
/r/imanadultandthisstuffisstillofacademicandsocietalinterest
Pursuing happiness is a goal one can set for himself, but it is in no way an absolute meaning that life imbues upon us.You can set that as YOUR meaning of life and live in peace, though.
Maybe he should explore things on his own rather than letting the front page decide for him
It's not the similar content of the videos that bothers her/him. It's the existential issue. I don't like being reminded of it much either. 
Rick is a spook 
If you could post that essay by midnight Pacific time, I would read it too. APA format is the most readable, don't you think? 
you didn't know nazis have monkey tails?
I wish it was just the disregard for reverence and shittalking. The more the show tries to be profound the more annoyed I become. I'm pretty much at the point where the show is ruined for me.
Yeah, dude. Nothing is nihilist. 
The best way to start hating something you love is engage in the online community for it
I'm sure it's because a lot of redditors are in high school. The themes in Rick and morty *are* deep, if you're 15 and never heard of them before. We were all there once, and information was new to all of us; I just avoid the online discussion of it haha
Thank you for catching that <3
Still doesn't really check out, it would make more sense to advertise one of the brand's current products, wouldn't it? It's like me trying to sell you Reddit by telling you about the button from two years ago. Besides, there isn't any evidence for this that couldn't be cast aside to 'the creators just like the sauce'
Lol no, I was just glad to hear that he enjoyed the video.
Aren't we talking about Buddhism here? The concept of doing without doing?
> a nihilist or existentialistThese are two very different things though. A nihilist believes there is no meaning and no point to having a meaning in life, while and existentialist believes that there is no *inherent* meaning in life, and that therefore one must make a meaning for oneself.Nihilism liberates you from any and all responsability, while existentialism gives you the freedom to choose how to live your own life (once you accept that it has no inherent greater purpose).
You think that post is of academic interest?
please give me a list of the other things in life you don't want to be confronted with so we can censor them out of existence, thank you. 
That's racist, and nobody uses that term anymore anyway. They prefer African American. 
Stirner's rational egoist. 
Do you have any evidence from episodes that support this?
Tell your instructor you're too busy reading Reddit and arguing with people on leftbook and you'll have it tomorrow 
I don't know if we need another non degreed person spewing philosophy on YouTube. Definitely something I've thought about though. I think we can all settle for Philosophy Tube for now, although Olly took the path of asking if Rick and Morty were existentialist. 
They didn't enslave and destroy inferior people for any ideology though, they did it for profit and fun.
For what it's worth there are plenty of anime shows that avoid those common anime tropes. You're probably thinking of shonen anime which is meant for teenage boys essentially. There are is also a seinen which is meant for a more mature adult audience, plus other genres intended for both young and older female a as well.
*gestures significantly at this thread*
TIL I'm Buddhist, not lazy.
A lot of people support assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. This is due to them not having to experience great pain and suffering when there is no chance of recovery.Depression is not curable or even reliably treatable in some cases. It also causes great pain and suffering. It's not that far of a leap from there to support it if they have tried to get help and nothing really worked.
I'll admit I did have to go look up the definitions before commenting. But I think what I said was still relevant to both philosophies.Whether you find meaning in cake, or just enjoyment, you still live on.A question I would ask, in reference to /u/keliseart>finding meaning in nothingWould that make you a nihilist or an existentialist?
what if you're just programmed to think that and are actually deluding yourself? would that matter?
Not that post in particular lolThe topic
We're talking about the nature of meaning. This falls into philosophy, psychology, sociology, humanities, design, politics, etc.
A strawman, here? Come now. 
Don't listen to him, you're beautiful. 
I think Rick acknowledges the existence of others, but in an infinite multiverse, any one individual's existence is worthless. Why should I care if my current granddaughter is killed if I have infinite granddaughters in other universes?
That makes a lot of sense. I'll have to look that up and check it out.
Lmao, yeah!
I think it's a pretty big leap to expect support based on that notion alone, assisted suicide is still a pretty new and provocative idea, as much as I hate to accept it I seriously doubt you'll see any medical practitioners suggesting that when they could just as easily convince you to stay alive so they can wring more money out of you, unfortunately I don't expect a sensible attitude or even decency from people who profit off of suffering.    
I'm also fairly new to the subject, don't worry. I would say that finding meaning in nothing is a form of existentialism, but as far as I can see /u/keliseart doesn't talk about meaning, so her/his position is probably closer to nihilism. 
But I would think, therefore exist, right? If I was programmed to think I was doing real stuff and unbeknownst to me, I wasn't, I'd be just like Jim Cary from the Truman Show before he found out he was on the Truman Show. I'd just go along my merry way and not suspect anything and all of my experiences would be so real to me. Even if I was deluded I don't see how that would make any difference to me. I'd still feel the pain and joy I feel now even if it was a little artificial. 
I replied to a specific comment for a reason though.
Oh right. I think i misunderstood something. Thanks for your reply tho 
Thanks! So are you.
That is pretty clearly refuted in the episode where he sacrifices himself for Morty, telling him to be better than he was. Rick doesn't have a consistent framework for his actions because he is a deeply depressed individual who actually avoids introspection whenever he can.
Brain in a Vat theory.
Oh trust me, I know, but will they listen? No, they're all "Sir the ball pit is for children under 12 only. I don't care if you've lost your shoe, that is adult language and you're making the children cry. The police are on their way."Bunch of savages in this town. 
Obviously in a truly infinite multiverse it's hard to argue that there is anything unique -- but Rick C-137 nevertheless holds himself to be unique, so it's at least possible for him to reasonably consider something/one else unique as well. It's possible that from Rick's perspective there is nothing special about the multitude of Summers, including the one he happens to be speaking to at that moment, but that there *is* something unique about "his" Morty, at least within the context of the show. 
My man Rene
He embraced Nihilism the same way a doctor embraces illness.If they said Active Nihilism or "Overcoming Nihilism" it would be more accurate, but still, so silly.
Two questions.   1.  What are your alternatives to a world with no purpose?It's not like we have definite proof what your purpose should be. You either have to find your own purpose or believe what someone else tells you your purpose is. There are no other options.   2. Why does the origin of your purpose even matter?You exist.  Leave the world a better place and enjoy the time you have here.  Find what makes you happy and how you can contribute to our world and do that.  
The Web is the best place to learn about and discuss our existence from a philosophical perspective, in my opinion. I haven't found anyone in-person who has had an existential crisis. Probably because a lot of people are religious.
Yeah, that was pretty dishonest.
A man chooses, a slave obeys
This raised a question in my mind: should we interpret that freedom as altruism? 
It probably will once they put out a few more sub par videos. 
Watching those two guys sculpt each other was pretty good, too, but this one might have more lasting effect. My college English professor suggested to me that I am an existentialist, and given what I knew about it at the time I disagreed. But after this video, it might actually be a suitable description. 
The problem isn't that there is little depth in Crash Course videos. The problem is that they often say things which are outright false.
Every single video I have seen on a philosopher I am familiar with has been absolutely awful. This video is no exception. They completely ignore Sartre's fenomenological/metafysical argument and misrepresent him on multiple occasions.
I would argue that Sartre's view is off because he supposed that we do not have a human nature. Modern genetics has taught us a lot about behaviors that are inherited from our parents, so his argument there doesn't exactly hold up. He also likes to use Freudian psychology, which is outdated.
Why do you think the greens are generally disliked on reddit? Genuinely interested. 
One of my professors told this story in class.. I believe he went to war
I still need to read more Camus, but I like his idea that we do indeed have an innate nature. Sartre denies this, and I don't believe it's scientifically accurate.
Common sense is disappointingly uncommon.
Rules, yes. Purpose? hmmm
I'm not trying to change your beliefs here, merely offer a counter to them. But ive always thought nihilism confuses the insignificance of an individual human life with being meaningless. Just because an individual is insignificant in the grand scheme does not make them meaningless. I think anything, alive or inanimate, that effects other things matters in some way. If you can change the world around you, even in the most infinitesimal way, you matter and have meaning to the whole of existence
For every person who has actually learnt about Neitzsche's work, there's 10 people who overheard him being mentioned a couple of times and want to sound like they've learnt about him. Same for like everything.
He breezes too quickly over Kierkegaard and Camus, but I think the rest is fairly accurate, and a decent explanation of the general ideas. This is honestly where I started learning about it, and it's a good TL;DR.
He went through a phase of it himself and believe that many people should, to a point, as well...because after all that his point is you then choose for yourself (if I remember correctly. More of the crash course series explained this further).
Turned out Camus didn't rhyme with humus. 
I balk at the idea that a philosophy 101 course would label Nietzsche a nihilist. That seems like a mistake that a person who'd never read Nietzsche in their life and had only ever misheard conversation about him would make. 
> Leave the world a better placeAs though that's any easier to define than one's purpose.
I followed up and read the essay.  Thank you for the suggestion. 
But aren't they questioning the point of their motivations?
he means the purpose he created from his own will is not universal - not everyone shares it - therefor not an ultimate truth/purpose thus kinda feels like a "fake" purpose.
That it is just my own construct. It is like saying "sorry" when you are not really sorry.  I might fool someone else, but I can't fool myself! 
When I made my comment I was obviously in a dark place, and it sounds like you can relate to it.  I do hope you are able to find that anchor.  
Wait really?
I never said that.
There's no statistics with a sample size of one
I liked MOR, but interestingly, a large part was because *I* talked the way HJPEV did, at that age. For me, the biggest suspension of disbelief was that he could have friends while being like that, too. IMO: Artemis Fowl, friendless, is a more believable character than HJPEV with a few friends his age.
That has to be almost the exact opposite message.The point of the Yudkowsky quote is that humans are amazing because we created the concepts of justice and fairness.Yours kinda seems to imply fairness is just a lie made to compensate the inferior.I am not downvoting, but I think Scott Adams might have an overly cynical world view.
That and many people don't feel comfortable talking about their existential crisis
Nihilism is important to him, yes. That doesn't make him a nihilist. He considered it a terrible thing.>You can play the edgy philisopher all you wantThere is nothing edgy about actually understanding what he said. That's a childish and anti-intellectual attitude.
No I don't think so. But I suppose it just depends what the individual does with their freedom. 
How so? I'm actually interested in Existentialist beliefs and I'd like a credible source of material. 
If you found this video accurate, I would go see about getting your money back from your philosophy course.
Interesting take, thank you!
> Any view is viable as long as it's well argued.Right, but a consensus among experts (professional philosophers) will likely tell us something about how accurate a view is.
Thank you!
>I think that's where Sartre gets it a bit wrongMore than just a bit.
Anything that has function has purpose, does it not? That purpose being the function itself. Human beings might struggle to find their own personal purpose and function, but the universe at large has function. For example, the function of gravity is to create orbit and collect matter to form stars and planets. So in the same sense, the purpose of gravity is also to create orbit and collect matter to create planets and stars
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE MAKING A PHILOSOPHY VID MAN
But apparently Christian Existentialists don't believe in Teleology.
Talk about worst sister. 
Don't overthink it. Here's a start:     * Help those who are in need, to the best of your ability.    * Speak authentically.    * Practice compassion.    * Give others the benefit of the doubt.Not an exhaustive list but any one of these things would leave the world a better place.
No one ever does but I find solace in knowing that I'm working on leaving a better world behind even if at the end of the day the world doesn't care. I care therefore I am (or something...). 
No, they're just following their motivations and acting as if there's conscious intention behind them.
My view is that I'd like to have them, but nothing (whether internal or external) has provided thus far.Besides that, I have no insight.
Isnt that the point of existentialism? The idea that there is no universial truth, and therefore there is no meaning in life. 
You are not lying to yourself when you imbue the world with purpose; like Sarte would say, you are the inventor, so invent. How, I would ask, is being an inventor of my meaning--something only capable of coming from my self--on par with being a liar?
Your comment and the one you responded to reminded me of the two sides that sprung up around>"THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE DEFEATED IS DEATH."
How would you characterize philosophers studying nihilism ?Which philosophers would then be nihilist ?If I remember well, the reason Nietzsche is considered a nihilist is because of Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche's work which he sees as the pinnacle of nihilism.
>everyone trusts the news until they cover the one area where they are an expert and they see how much they got wrongIt's kind of frightening, isn't it? After all, I'm vulnerable to this too...UGH!
How about the original books? I'd recommend starting with both Kierkegaard and Camus as they make a point of it to make their arguments sharp and clear. Camus- The strangerKierkegaard- Either/OrI'd recommend you start with those. There are some passages in Either/Or you can ignore though. One is about Mozart which I never understood, but the Diapsalmata and the seducer's diary is where it's at. 
Except there is no action that will ameliorate the kind of suffering Schopenhauer talks about.We exist to suffer in the same way the rat who is shocked into learned helplessness exists to suffer.
That's interesting. I'm no philosopher, so I don't know if there is a real distinction between purpose and function. I've always thought physics exist and it lets universe function but I never thought of it as physics exist TO let universe function. Hmm thanks for an interesting point :)
I agree, it's bad.
Disappointment describes a possible reaction to life events, but it is not necessarily required or automatic. Some existential philosophers (Sartre and Camus, for example) suggest we need not be disappointed, anxious, fearful, etc., when confronted with daunting or terrible events and that we have ultimate ownership of our emotions. Sisyphus can be happy with the certainty of his daily, repetitive toil; Meursault's despair can be washed clean by anger and hatred.
Clearly you've never met an objectivist.
I care therefore I am... I like that. Unfortunately there are a lot of people that don't care who also seem to, be.
Man, the illusion of control is really confusing. 
That's the saddest most pathetic motivation I can imagine. Yet for too many people, you are probably right.
Yes but there is equally no point in death either. There's no point in anything and we create our own realities either way, whether or not we believe it is for a greater "something" or a greater nothing. It's all contained within the mind.
But still though. Let's say that you think your life is important enough to you that you should not be murdered. If someone comes around and thinks that your life is important enough to be murdered/ended, then how are you supposed to apply a form of justice?I'm assuming here that that person and you would be otherwise "good" people.
>How would you characterize philosophers studying nihilism ?They can be characterized as philosophers studying nihilism. But that doesn't make them nihilists, just like how Marx is not a capitalist because he studied capitalism. 
Yes, but Nietzsche was *critiquing* that fall into nihilism, not at all embracing it. 
I gave away all my bootstraps in acts of compassion and now I have nothing to pull myself up by ;_;
Try reading some Heidegger. You might enjoy it. Discusses care as the defining property of being. Lack of care is still in relation to care. I don't fully get it but it was interesting 
Well, it make sense.If your internal motivations agreed with your self-image every moment of every day for your whole life, wouldn't you presume that you'd "chosen" to do what you do?
I would say it's a subconscious motivation.  I don't think it's "sad" or "pathetic" either.  It's the reason your ancestors were here and ultimately the reason why you're here.
You could name it something else and not really see how it affects your thoughts and behaviour but still it would be there in the background.
If someone finds it important enough to murder someone, then he must accept that there are people that find it important enough to stop him from murdering and punish him if he does murder. That is how you apply justice, because society has created a set of morals, or laws, that we must follow and people that go against those morals must be held accountable. 
Yeah, just answer the second part of the question without answering the first one. By your definition there is **NO** nihilist philosopher.And the downvote, what bullshit behavior.
Not now, VSauce, not now.
What a surprise :I
Is there a "better" option out there that anyone reading this would recommend?
Also not very good at philosophy. How do you know he was critiquing it? Reading this quote -and nothing else- sounds blatantly nihilistic. I don't doubt you at all, I am just wondering how you know that. Which one  of his works is what I'm asking I guess.  
Underrated comment
Lol I am not sure I get it either. Pizza is the defining property of being, lack of pizza is still in relation to pizza. 
I wouldn't say anyone leads a distasteful life. Things are, or are not. Applying adjectives to things or ideas helps to humanize them. This idea that anything is inherently good or evil is a human concept, in my opinion. 
I don't see how my being here as a result of it makes it at all a compelling argument. It isn't as though they did me a favor that I should be grateful for. If anything it is a compelling argument for why it is a bad idea.
The problem is conflating purpose in the human psychology sense with purpose in the "your body has evolved to be capable of this" sense.
The murderer can just as easily claim that since there is no objective morality, then he cannot be brought to stand trial since the court does not use/uphold an objective form of law.
First of all, I didn't downvote you. Secondly, I actually answered the first question, not the second one. The reason for not answering the second question is that I honestly don't know any explicitly nihilistic philosophers. Nihilism is a position much like solipsism: It's used as an insult, but there are not many, if any, people arguing for it. Which philosophers would you consider to be nihilists and why?
Excluding special knowledge, expert consensus is as close to the truth as we're gonna get on specialized issues such as this one. Do you think you have a better way of finding truth?
I heard the fucking mindfuck music when I read that.
I really like the philosophybites podcast. It features interviews with real philosophers and attempts to put them in a context where a general audience can understand.
he suggests that man has killed god with their pity for him and ourselves. that we have allowed ourselves to become as small as we felt in the face of nihilism. he was stating the opposite really; that only by imposing upon our selves values that we uphold despite ourselves, we overcome our limitations and are able to be so content in life that we would be happy to live the same life over again exactly the same way if we had to. 
Oh my description of it is awful. I'll do some digging and try to give you better synopsis haha
Well point is your psychology is your mind, which is a function of your brain, which is the transposition of your genes into the world.
It's not a problem though is it.  There's a field dedicated to it called Evolutionary Psychology.  Seems kind of obvious to me.  
We can objectively say that society has set a code of laws that are brought upon by everyone that if they wish to live in this society, then they must abide by those laws or face punishment. As people we have decided that murder is wrong and does nothing, but cause suffering. 
I'm not saying a consensus of expert opinions/findings isn't the truth. I'm just saying that you can't immediately assume that *because* there's a consensus on something that therein lies the truth. It's a logical fallacy. Experts are experts because of the amount of knowledge they have, and there does need to be a trust that the experts in their fields know what they're talking about, but you should always look at the arguments/findings/evidence/data and see whether or not it holds up. 
A fair point.
Give it a rest.
I believe what science tells us, that we are just a complex chemical reaction. I see no reason that should mean our thoughts and feelings are somehow not real. A cpu is just a piece of silicone, but the computation it does is still very real. I am a pile of atoms that can think and feel. 
Okay.  But for those of us who aren't existentially satisfied entirely by procreation, it's definitely a problem.
> you should always look at the arguments/findings/evidence/data and see whether or not it holds up. This is the part I take issue with. Barring exceptional distorting influences (corruption in a field), I have no reason to believe my own research would be as good as a professional's. I love looking at the arguments, as I love understanding the workings behind something, but it's absurd to think I could do better research than hordes of smart people who have dedicated their lives to a subject.
Even skimming wiki should give one this clear understanding as that's all I've read of Nietzsche pretty much. How do people miss this, and whats more public popular youtube videos making this mistake?
The chapter that is quoted from is all about a work of art by Sophie Calle, called Take Care of Yourself.  Bolt uses that work as a means to talk about Heidegger's theories, primarily from his book "Being and Time" (1927), more comprehensibly.   
As is the case for all Turkish classes. In Literature class, the exams outright ask us "what are the 5 attributes of this very specific type of ottoman poetry" and the university entrance exam mostly consists of "from which writer's book was this exerpt taken from?"We need a major rehaul.
One semester (or year) of English. There's already four years of that in high schoool (at least where I'm at). And all the most critically important skills from English class carry *directly* over into philosophy.I can personally confirm that one Intro to Ethics class made me a far better reader and writer than sitting through yet another semester of Shakespeare.
To be fair, a VHS tape of a pineapple talking about kantian metaphysics couldn't make it any *more* impenetrable.
My thought exactly. I learned my logic from being a "math" kid. Philosophy is a great for things like forming arguments, but things the American public deem more important can teach that just as well (history, english)
This is why my father wanted to send me to private school; they had a logic class taught by a philosophy PhD. I think that you have a good point, and perhaps this should be a parent's responsibility. All you really need is a book and someone to talk to about it. 
Schools are struggling in the US just to graduate kids that can read and write, much less do math. Get real, indeed :(
Speak for yourself. 
Yep, philosophy doesn't have any effect on most of the students even if mandatory 
"What is the task of all higher education?" To turn men into machines. "What are the means?" Man must learn to be bored. "How is that accomplished?" By means of the concept of duty. "Who serves as the model?" The philologist: he teaches grinding. "Who is the perfect man?" The civil servant. "Which philosophy offers the highest formula for the civil servant?" Kant's: the civil servant as a thing-in-itself raised up to be judge over the civil servant as phenomenon. ~Nietzsche
I took this course. It was pretty interesting.
> Why do you need philosophy if we can just have classes in branches of philosophy?  seriously though those are basic branches of philosophy... Your question makes no sense.
All the more reason to start now, so that the teachers of the future will be better at it.
Hm, I didn't think of that. I'll look more into that later and might change my opinion to 6-12. Do you think there is a way you could "plant the seeds" at a younger age though?
High school or college?
Hell Yeah! But start the course off with some proper standing up arcade stuff - these kids have gotta learn some respect for history. 
This is exactly how I feel.
This inevitably happens to all "school subjects", especially those that correspond to a state testing regime.
Tragically true..
What philosophy have you engaged with ? 
Math classes usually don't teach formal logic. And social studies is hardly a substitute for ethics.
Learning about some schmuck's opinions helps you to reason? UM No! That's like saying reading the bible will make you smarter.
This reminded me of the university entrance exam in Ukraine. One of the questions was "What shoes did the wife of the main character wear when she went to the market?".
Well seeing as the Turkish government rewards diligence and not critical thinking, I'd say the education system is working exactly as intended.
This is an interesting proposal.  A good philosophy course reinforces a lot of the core competencies english is supposed to cover (grammar, critical reading, argumentation, etc.).In fact you might be able to just use existing english teachers with some additional training (and a restyled course title like "humanities").  Obviously there would be resistance from some existing teachers at first but I think a lot of English teachers would be thrilled and a new generation would just take it as part of the landscape.
???Reading is core skill which America already lacks in high school graduates. 
I think logic itself should be taught as a class.Because some people can apply logic mathematically, or philosophically, and not vice-versa
Critical thinking can be taught in any class. As a STEM student who came from a good high school with a strong liberal arts focus, I gained most of my argumentative and reasoning skills from English and history classes. If OP's point was that the skills required to engage in logical discussion should be an integral part of every curriculum, then I totally agree. If his/her point was that one cannot gain those skills outside of a philosophy class, then OP's full of bullshit.
On the other hand it could be like my high school philosophy classes, reading pre-Socratic texts, then a little bit of Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Kant, Foucault and Nietzsche.
My school didn't care. They just let everyone graduate, so they can get more funding for sports. 
Living in the Bible Belt, philosophy is also blocked for similar reasons. 
He's speaking for you too, nerd
I lost all sympathy for OP's argument when he advocated ignoring law and order. An illegal immigrant is an *illegal* immigrant.If you don't want them deported, change the law so that all migration is legal. But of course you'd never do that because then the general public would be made aware of how lax their law enforcement is.
> It was designed to sort out elites from everyone elseElites don't need sorting. Public school was designed to sort out those who may be useful to the elite.
Philosophy claims that everything is a branch of philosophy.
Yes, but it would land on the parents to ask 'why' instead of defaulting to 'because I said so'.
To be fair, not much at all. It was invariably a bit of a dead-end, like metaphysics or solipsism. Instead of studying rational approaches to higher-level ideas like these, I'd like to see more focus on day-to-day things, like rational decision making in the face of unknowns, or what constitutes good and bad arguments and why.
Sounds like English literature exams in my school jn the Netherlands.Luckily, most exams are a bit better
Oooh. Very true. 
Was friends with University Assistants in college who were very adept at spotting plagiarism. Any suspicious turn of phrase got Googled. I've been under the impression plagiarism had gotten harder since the internet, not easier.
That's exactly what true maths is about. You start from the very basics, and then you build up your argument with sentences of which you can prove the truth. Even the logic is a branch of math and people could benefit very much from it.  There is a reason as to why almost all the brightest phylosophers in history were also brilliant mathematicians.
The stoics would like you. 
I'm about to get my BS from a state university having never taken a foreign language course in high school nor college. So I would say some some parts of the nation have managed to rid themselves of that already.
This is reddit... As far as I'm concerned, his statement doesn't contain any gross grammatical errors (though "all the most" instead of "all of the most" is kind of irritating). If he doesn't want to disclose his actual location, "where I'm at" is perfectly fine for casual conversation. 
Philosophy can literally supplant english for a year as a form of it.  You still read in philosophy. You can even assign books or just read from passages for philosophy. It can be like 11th grade- english:literature  12th grade- english: philosophy.
Totally agree with this.  Most people live there whole lives thinking logic is nothing more than a good sounding argument pulled straight out of their ass.  Logic is a science.  It has laws and rules that can't be bent or broken, and while built on philosophy, is much more important.
Have you ever studied philosophy at a university? There is so much that is left out of those history and English classes. Also I would argue that forming those arguments are just as important as learning how to form them. 
I'm not a teacher, and I understand it has unrealistic standards of young children, but doesn't common core attempt to teach critical thinking as a skill for every subject?
My god they tried to do all of that in high school?Teaching Nietzsche to high schoolers is child abuse. 
There's two types of "language" that is taught in school. The first type is spelling and grammer, which is mostly memorization. But the other type, that I'm assuming CherryTomatoGarden is talking about is reading literature and analyzing what the characters did and why, and very much teaches philosophy.
Yup. Hey kids, let's learn some Nietzsche today! It totally won't conflict with everything your parents have taught you.
Eh, America isn't a complete aristocracy.  Even if social mobility is on the low side people and families can still move up.
When I think of bright philosophers I think of people like Nietzsche or Heidegger and when I think of more dry philosophers I think of the mathematicians like Russel and such. 
"The lunch time is not up to us."
Definitely guilty of omitting "of". It's fairly common in my region to omit "of" when it isn't deemed necessary. I recognize that doesn't make it right, but such is the nature of colloquial language.
I'm a native English speaker and I don't see what's wrong with that. Where I'm at makes sense, albeit a little slang. 
there is reading, and then there is reading at a high school graduate level
> Philosophers of ScienceInteresting. This explains a lot! I study Math but took a lot of Philosophy classes. I have taken these upper-div logic classes from a Philosophy Professor (which were about Model Theory, Computibility and Philosophy of Mathematics, respectively). Both the Professor and GSIs (or TAs) were in this subgroup of the department of Philosophy called "The Group for Logic and Methodology of Science". I always wondered why they have "Methodology of Science" in the name. It makes sense that philosophers working on logic are mostly philosophers of science. Good to know.
I have, and I feel like my best high school English teachers did a better job teaching philosophy than my best college philosophy professors.
You're taught logical fallacies in English. At least I was in both middle and high school.
Kind of.  I am In a bilingual school.  Spelling and grammar in English is one thing, but a foreign language immersion requires the same mental skills as logic.  Add to that doing things as you described- reading, character study, social studies debate, etc.- doing all of that in the other language?  I really strive to challenge my kids not just to give me an answer, but to know why they gave it and be able to support it.
Really, I'm not sure what I'd think about Nietzsche being taught at a high school level, simply as a matter of difficulty.Keep it Greek. Highly beneficial, comparably accessible, less controversial.
That's unusual. From what I can tell, Catholic schools are (mostly) pretty good.
Pretty much, yes. I've had parents complain just for mentioning I have a background in philosophy. 
I sure hope you're practicing your reading skills in history, science and other classes. Why is there a need to teach reading fiction for four years?
Then you probably didn't have very good philosophy professors.
That is uncommon.
Good for you teaching your kids logic like that! I never quite got the whole foreign language thing myself, as a math and computer programming guy that part of my brain never clicked. And now my girlfriend speaks another language as her first language :P She speaks English almost as well as me though fortunately.
The Germans do definitely have a bit of an edge of controversy in them compared to the Greeks. 
Which is interesting considering the history of Christianity and philosophy, which has been close since.. when, Augustine? Aquinas at the latest. At some point some Protestant denominations seemed to ditch it. I wonder when and why.
You're not wrong.
It's really not uncommon to learn about fallacies in English class.  In the freshman composition books I've used, there has always been a discussion of fallacy.
Well if it makes you feel better, computer programming is basically a second language :). One that I would have a hard time learning, for sure.  Except it's like Latin, where it serves a very specific purpose.
Socrates (or Plato's version of him) was all about questioning authority. 
When the agenda changed from God to money and they learned keeping the masses stupid allows you to take more money from them.
Just loads of personal experience and lots of daily evidence that the vast majority of people, including scientists, have little to no understanding of logic and fallacy. A quality philosophical education can help you identify such shortcomings. I've found most students in the us can't disect a sentence much less identify a fallacy. Find some evidence that it is common. I'd love to see it. I'm always happy to see education getting better.
Well the masses were always ignorant. Perhaps that is the difference - many Protestant sects, at least American ones, are 'all masses'. No educated elite guiding them a la the Catholic Church who can say 'no it doesn't mean that *literally*'. Without them, literalism is all that is left. Just a theory.
You were the one that claimed it was uncommon.  The proof is yours to provide.
That sounds pretty cool. 
Username does not check outUnless oxen are some real cynical bastards
>If somehow you saw any of this as positive you are the problem with our generation.How's it like living in LaLa land?
thats not how i saw it at all.  I read a book, Philosophy Through Film by Mary Litch, where she absolutely persuaded me that film/tv can and should be used as a *springboard* for examining philosophical questions.  The keyword here is *springboard*.  I didn't see the video as an attempt at exposing a deeper meaning in the screenwriting,  I just saw it as an interesting attempt at making philosophy relevant and accessible to a wider audience than just philosophy students and professors. 
Nietzsche and Heidegger*
I watched the episode where he calls for a gun protest in the city and buys shares in Gunther's Guns in order to make moneyBut on the other hand there is an episode where he says he wants to live in squalorHe is probably motivated by both
With the best moral fiber.  Relatively speaking, of course.
Scary thing is, I'm the least cynical of all the ox's. Source: I've personally met and know every ox
Television is an opiate of the masses.
Uh, that there was no explanation of Nietzsche? This was crazy -- it was an account of "Nietzsche" indistinguishable from any modern philosopher. 
Steve Carell in Little Miss Sunshine does it in the first ten minutes.
Frank just wants to be pure.
? how do you mean
I definitely enjoyed the video. And if not for that I wouldn't have taken the time to have an intellectual thought about the show for sure. I wasn't attacking the video if that's how it sounded. But it feels good to know that my thinking wasn't totally flawed. I was almost afraid to post my thoughts on the video
Are you talking about the video content or the comment you replied to? I fail to see how either could be defined as two opposing forces going back and forth.
I can respect that.
Well first, the OPs whole point was that the way they live is authentic compared to a significant portion of people, and they're happy doing it. This is absolutely ridiculous cause they are clearly unhappy. For specific moments for this, that's most of the show. But OPs thought process is something like "they choose to do it, therefore that is happiness to them"
Thanks man :)    My bad.  
He doesn't do it for the money. He does it for the scheme. He's a hero
He has a want or need, how ever much he hates talking about it, to be with Dennis, dee and Charlie 
If anything, Mac wants respect/people to fear him.  The strength is just a way to make that happen.
So You think not eating cat food is putting on airs
Frank wants hot dogs.
You're right. I think people are exclusively thinking and commenting between the OP "god is dead creates a search for authenticity" and people claiming "that proposed character basis is wrong or faulty analysis due to fiction," so that they didn't realize OP is using the right definition of authenticity and it applies well.    Much in the same way an abusive partner shouldn't hold your interest, IASIP works well because we never know what they'll come up with to do next.
To answer the rhetorical, yeah man if the video draws parallels between artistic works and philosophy, then that's worth talking about. It lets you see both the theory and the show in a new light. 
I think it is good that they got across God is dead without connecting that to any grandiose metaphysical claims (which normal misinterpretations of Nietzsche often fall into), the fact that it is just a sociological statement and that it undermines the notion of truth.  That's distinctly Nietzschean and it is something most philosophers would oppose.
Great movie
The man sad it himself, "am gonna get weird with it" and he does.
He lives on the fringe class. Neither low class or high class. He's a class of his own, Frank class. I think he's one of the most interesting characters of the show. He doesn't seem to have much motivation other than doing hedonistic shit and is, in a way, the least relatable character.
OK. I think OP has the wrong concept of "authenticity" then. Authenticity, in most existential literature, is a "living out" of one's true self. It's not a negative concept, merely not acting according to societial norms and values, although that usually happens as an offshoot. Either way, I'll stick with my original point. A person can act without concern for societal rules and norms in a wanton way that is nonetheless completely un-authentic from an existential perspective. 
yeah? Why wouldn't I?   If someone has found a more effective medium for sharing philosophical questions and propositions to the world, I would think this would be the MOST important place to share it.  Maybe I'm wrong.  
Well said.  Perhaps I assumed too much reading your first post.
Not that he shouldn't be corrected politely
I wonder if the show would have been as good as it is without him?
Mac want his father to hug him when he was a kid. He wants those strong safe arms around him. he wants those strong arms. He wants to feel safe, being buff gives security. The same goes for his relationship with dennis in a way, in addiotion to the gay thing
WHO EATS HOT DOGS LIKE THAT?
God is dead *is* a grandiose metaphysical claim in Nietzsche -- God is dead is part of the revaluation of all values. God is dead, and we have killed him. But will we rise to the occasion of needing to posit our values ourselves, in the knowledge that they are unfounded--except by force of our will? 
The argument is that they are the only ones that have been able to live life as their one true self because they have shed the societal skin that prevents normal people from doing so.I personally think that reasonably validates their authenticity claim.
Watch season one
Only in the sense of what it implies, I was pointing out it isn't the same as atheism.
Yeah that doesn't follow at all. First, not living according to external rules (norms, values etc.) doesn't mean you're living according to your authentic self. A person can fully endorse societal norms and rules and still be authentic, and vice versa.Second, the gang constantly exhibit behaviours which show that they care deeply about societal norms, rules and values (they are usually just too weak or stupid or flawed to be effective in doing so).
yess Craig.  But uh oh!  It looks like a fit of pique has made the puppeteer the puppet!  :)
Season one isn't as good as the rest but that's to be expected I think
I feel like Frank really opened up Charlie's character as well. Their partnership is a nice contrast to the Mac/Dennis duo.
S1 was good but when Frank is introduced it just gets so much better
It's really not bad, but not great. Charlie, Dennis and Mac are more or less the same characters they always are and are hilarious doing it. It hurts without having Frank, but the big thing holding it back is that Dee is relegated to the boring voice of reasons too much. Even when she does bad things, it sounds like she's really reluctant to do it and is out of character for her. When they started letting her improvise her character, her dialogue, etc. to sound more authentic, the show benefited *hugely* from it
Honestly in season one even my first watch through its funny but it feels like there's something missing. Going back now knowing Frank is involved I can find 2-3 places per episode Frank would've been hilarious to be in if he was a part of it then. 
Yeah, overall season one was more tame. Not worse, just less Sunny. I don't think it necessarily had to be DeVito, they just needed a 4th crazy person to amp things up. Although DeVito is a great fit, and his star power helped boost the show's ratings overnight.
>Yeah, overall season one was more tame.which is hilarious because they said "niggers hanging from the rafters" in the first five minutes of dialogue
They started giving Dee a bit more creative license in Season 2. They just sort of let her do her own thing and adjust/ad-lib  all of her dialogue to not be the nagging, stereotypical girl in a group of guys. It also shows off how good of an actor she can be. "Hundred Dollar Baby" is probably the best Dee episode from season 2 
It sounds like you're describing Stockholm Syndrome.
> How do you put it on paper so that people know where the line is?Can the line be defined?Force feeding me bacon sounds like a fantasy come true. It might not be so much for a religious Muslim.
It isn't different. Leave aside the morality question, you don't know if they are a terrorist unless convicts by 12 jurors. The constitution prevents extra judicial punishment of people whether they are terrorist or witches or communists. Everyone is fair gave when you don't prove guilt first. 
In my view, torture is next-level prolonged suffering as a form of punishment, and/or cruel and unusual forms of execution (popular in medieval times). Like being broken on the wheel, boiled/burned alive, or crucified... Sometimes those events took hours, or even days to kill someone - not quick, or dare I say, humane like electrocution or lethal injection. Nobody (in their right mind) is going to volunteer for that. I think we're hard-wired with a sense of self-preservation that wouldn't allow it.
What would they say? Is it effective or is it not?
Police would likely be far more effective in preventing/prosecuting crime if they had CCTV cameras in every room in every person's house, but any reasonable person would find that gain irrelevant compared to the intangible value of privacy.The same argument can be put forth here.
>We found Osama through torture, so it must be decently effective. That's likely not true. There's a senate torture report concluding that torture didn't help, although the CIA disagrees with that.
I could imagine an ISIS sympathizer making this exact same post. You think they are just crazy animals slaughtering human beings for Allah. In reality, they are retaliating. Avenging their dead and lost. Just like we retaliate and avenge our dead and lost. I am not equivocating you with a terrorist, but rather inviting you to take another look at your rhetoric and see it for what it is.
But people are too stupid / have the wrong perspective.
How so? Just because you're allowed to kill people under certain circumstances doesn't mean that you can torture them, just like how killing combatants in battle is different from killing prisoners.  
> Like say we know that a terrorist has information that, if obtained, will save several innocent lives from a bombing or something. Is it still wrong to torture him then?Probably not.  But...> we know that a terrorist has information that, if obtained, will save several innocent lives from a bombing or something....how can you ever know that with 100% certainty?  Even if the guy says "I planted a bomb in a school", how can you know?  Maybe he's just a whack job and you end up torturing a mentally ill person.  
> It is meant to explore whether personal agency has a place in ethics.This is a bit of an assertion, if you read JJ Thompson you'll see that there are many explanations for why it is good to pull the switch.It is also still a dilemma, something like a fifth of philosophers state they would not pull the switch.
I understand where you're coming from but the question is not from one persons perspective. One person feeling 'bad' is not equal to many feeling 'bad'. This is exactly why there are countless stories of heroism and selfless behaviour. In basic this is Empathy.
The goal of torture has similarly departed from the medieval times.  This isn't torture to wring out some coerced confession, or anything along those lines.  It's used specifically for gaining corroborating, actionable intelligence.  There's a significant difference.
I'm not arguing for torture, and I'm not saying it works. I agree, I think it rarely does and the downsides out weigh the benefits in reality. I'm saying his arguments are weak though. I find *your* arguments better than his paper.
This whole debate makes the assumption that torture does work. He states that.And what if the person won't volunteer? If it's the head of ISIS, he isn't going to volunteer to be to tortured to give up info he was unwilling to give up in the first place.It feels like you're reaching to confirm an answer rather than thinking it through. 
If the definition of torture depends on who uses it, it's not a very good definition.
I don't think you're fully clear on what Stockholm Syndrome is.Stockholm Syndrome refers to the specific case in which a hostage develops an affinity for their captor. The above situation is just referring to how individuals, when instructed to commit deplorable acts, have to believe in the individual instructing them to do so, because their entire world would collapse upon them if they didn't. 
Retribution and deterrence are only distinct in motive, not in effect. Both are about inflicting suffering.Rehabilitation isn't even worth addressing because that isn't actually something that the prison system does.Incapacitation only makes sense for lifers. For people who eventually will be released, you are releasing them as more hardened criminals than they were when they went in.
If that were true, then people wouldn't be incarcerated for stuff like tax evasion, drug possession, etc. And they wouldn't be released. You do society no favors by locking someone up for a few years, intentionally making them even worse, and then releasing a hardened criminal back onto the streets while making it almost impossible for them to earn an honest living.
Okay let's say torture is morally wrong no matter what. Now consider someone has a code to preventing the detonation of a nuclear bomb and you can only get the code by torturing him.  Should I torture him or not? 
Force feeding you 20kg of bacon is probably less of a fantasy, though. The Japanese put hoses into POW's mouths and filled their stomachs with water during WW2. Not sure it helped with useful information.
Do you think it's just an arbitrary quantitative divide from suffering? For example, if someone is merely imprisoned, that might cause them terrible suffering. But on the same continuum, making a little kid wait for hours in a room might cause them suffering. Where does it become torture? I'm afraid the distinction often seems to involve disgust and gore, which might help explain why waterboarding isn't so much condemned and TV personalities even volunteer for it without understanding.
Whether something is ever moral and whether it should be legal are different questions.
But they dont actually make any reference to why it IS bad, other than "it just is". That isn't an argument, its just a claim.
thats why theres further follow up torture sessions. but even if half of the information gathered is not accurate thats still half thats useful. where as you're likely to get little or no information at all using other methods. 
I see no difference between the two. 
That's conflating criteria of justification with decision-making procedures, though. It's useful to keep them distinct. 
So tempting to reply to this and ask how that's possible when Adams seem to still be spot on and was one of the few "pundits" predicting a Trump win. But ... You know, probably not the place.
Holy shit.  "Climate change is a hoax because Trump is an expert bullshit detector."  Yeah, I agree with you, dude needs to stick to his comics.
How about legally mandated vaccines vs torture? Most would argue that the outcome is a greater good, for a majority - even if the subject may be unwilling.
Sorry I might not have been clear.  I wasn't arguing that it was morally right, but rather that we wouldn't like it if our enemy were to do it to our own captured citizens/soldiers.We can imagine a scenario where "the bad guys" torture, and we'd think that it was immoral.  The second we permit our own side to torture, we're essentially saying agreeing that the other side was justified in doing so in order to be victorious, and we'd have one less reason to call them "the bad guys".
You don't just onto a philosophy subreddit and say "Trust me when I say this"
If you can get out of it it isn't a dilemma. Dilemmas don't have solutions. But many philosophers do. The reason the trolley problem is brought up is because it is obvious how the utilitarian would behave. 
That seems like a distinction without difference. The intent might be different than medieval times, but the result of the torture is the same. 
Yes actually it is. Would you rather loose sleep in your own piss for a few hours or have nails driven into you? 
I wonder why they like doing that to others now, then?  Very strange.  Have they forgotten how horrible it is?  They should administer an annual waterboarding exam for everyone.  It should be like getting a drivers license.
Are you saying that justifies our use of waterboarding?
I had not realized we were trying to one up them.
You're describing the exact same process that happens in both scenarios.>because their entire world would collapse upon them if they didn't. Why exactly do you think people "develop an affinity" towards their captors otherwise?
> Rehabilitation isn't even worth addressing because that isn't actually something that the prison system does.I like prison documentaries. I have watched a lot of them now. This statement is wrong.
I was specifically referring to Gitmo when I referred to individual (or rather specific) cases. You can't say all prisons are torture just because Guantanamo is, which was my point.Yes, there's a disconnect in those who design prisons and policy with the ideal intent of prisons. I just don't see your reasoning that US prisons are designed for torture on purpose. It's hyperbolic and takes away from the real problem with torture in our culture.
That's a good question, and not one I have a good answer to. Every moral theory has its objections, and they often are the dual of the objections to their rivals (so the benefit of consequentialism is its ability to count for this case, but its defect  is telling you to kill one to save two (or slightly more)).
I don't think it's that arbitrary. Torture is a fairly vicious, sadistic, and barbaric method purposefully intending to cause physical or psychological harm. It may be used as punishment, or to extract information. I don't believe imprisonment rises to the level of torture, so long as it isn't accompanied by physical harm (i.e. maiming, lashing, branding, beatings, starvation), or severe psychological harm causing a person to lose their grip on reality (sometimes a result of prolonged isolation). 
But is there any level of criminality that would make you find such prevention method acceptable?That's the point I'm trying to convey - most people would never find that acceptable no matter what the risk, so it's not really a sacrifice/gain balance.
Actually you have that detail wrong about torture. The worst case scenario is precisely when half your information is accurate, and you end up believing the *wrong half*. Which is sadly more common than your rosy scenario where we somehow know which half is correct and it becomes "useful". In which case you have telepathy and don't need torture to begin with.
Thank you for your response, it goes in line with what my friends have said.
Alright. You probably will agree with me that it's permissible to use force - even lethal force if necessary - in order to defend yourself from an armed intruder, right? Now do you think that this gives you the right to torture the intruder to death after you have already incapacitated him?
> It's useful to keep them distinct.As a philisophical exercise, I agree. But if people are coming here to think about current events critically, it's probably good not to glaze over parts and say "that's another topic for later". 
I have a bomb.  Are you going to come torture me?
Well, to be fair, I think that's more of an excuse than a logical progression. Adams was a climate change denier years before Trump was anything but a slumlord and mass-marketing huckster.Of course, given his educational background, he has essentially no excuse to ignore the science regardless of his agreement with the political component.
Well that's where we get into areas where we discuss which principles are okay to use to subvert someone else's autonomy (combined with causing them incredible mental and physical trauma). Your example of mandatory vaccines falls under the principles of weak paternalism and welfare, and are also quite non-invasive principles. Not many systems of ethics, when explored fully actually think that torture is permissible. The only system that does, broadly speaking, would be consequentialism, and that category of ethical systems is plagued with problematic conclusions that most people can't accept.
I completely 100% disagree. They used torture during they centuries because A) they did not understand as much about psychology as us. B) sadismAnd c) entertainment ( which could fit under sadism) but im thinking more like gladiator- forced to kill or be killed ( i would consider this torture)
Look at it within it's context. So, you don't agree? You don't agree that if intelligence agencies didn't use their advanced interrogation techniques, aka torture, for the past decades, many people wouldn't be alive? It's rather common sense than anything else. 
I'm not going to argue about the definitions of terms, but that doesn't match any definition of dilemma I've ever seen.  I took you to be using it in the colloquial sense in which the choice is difficult (which is true if there is no consensus about how to answer the question) and each side seems somewhat bullet-biting.
But those effects are also just increases in numbers. By the same logic, if one person has been extremely scared and hurt in the history of humanity, why does it then matter if more get scared and hurt by the fact that multiple people die in a crowd?
What one would rather do is irrelevant, both are torture. 
Yes, they have forgotten. Or more accurately, they never knew in the first place.  I'm not sure if you realize, but there are very few people still alive who experienced WWII. The youngest of those would be in their late 80s. 
No, just that they are already using 10x more brutal methods, both physically and mentally. 
While some prisons do have positive programs like education, wouldn't you agree that in most cases the effects of prison on the prisoner are a net negative? With that, how could it be rehabilitating its people?
Appreciate the honest response,  thanks. 
Ah, that's a much more realistic scenario.  You tell me,  was Vic right? How would someone who isn't a consequentialist explain this? That he was wrong and should have done it anyway? 
> But is there any level of criminality that would make you find such prevention method acceptable?Yes. If the police were 100% trustworthy and 20% of the local population were serial killers. Saying that, in every room is still overkill, and you would just move out.
Stick to the scenario. Assume he will not give up the information in any other way, otherwise the experiment is flawed as we havent controlled for all variables.
Its a hypothetical. Just answer the question properly based on those assumptions.
>Because it is bad but does not produce good, it is not justified.That means you are also a consequentialist,  since you think the morality of it depends on its effectiveness. If we managed to make a truth syrum for example that garenteed gave answers 99.999% of the time, but caused horrible agony, would it then be justified?
That doesnt matter, this is a theoretical mind experimental to see whether or not torture is ever moral. Its often useful to look at the extremes to test our views on morality.
Sure, I just think it's good to be clear about each because I think conflating them is part of the confusion. For example: there will be cases where the right thing to do will be to torture the detainee, but they will be so rare and difficult to identify that when we are engaging in moral decision-making, we simply ought never to do it. My view is that this approach will help satisfy the intuitive response that clearly these cases exist, while also bringing things back in the domain of reality. 
I'd shoot you, blow you up, i'll try to cause as least amount of deaths as possible. If you planted an explosive, then i'd torture you to find out where. So I save/protect as many people as possible. 
Torture is one of the only things that should and can be banned universally. 
So you are saying not once in human history a prisoner has "spilled the beans" under torture. Those are some top quality prisoners if I may say so.
Welp, then I guess our enemies will have to do it to us so we can refresh our memories once again until 50 years later, we have to do another refresh.
Assuming that's true, what's your point?
> You tell me, was Vic right?He was right as in the guy did actually kidnap the girl and they did rescue her.  Right morally?  I'd say no, because they didn't know 100% he took her.
...What?What the fuck does that have to do with *anything*?
In this scenario, torture could be used to save an insane amounts of lives, which is why I'd go for that option.In the real world, it isn't as much of a no brainer, as a situation like this is immensely unrealistic  and torture would never be the only or best method of gaining information. So I'm still 100% against using torture in the real world.
Sorry, this isn't how logic works. Your "hypothetical" is fatally flawed in its premises. Move on.
It's never moral. This is one reason if an interrogator's family were in danger, we would relieve the interrogator of his duties. Because we recognize that the right choice (not to torture) is one the interrogator would likely be incapable of making. It's similar to why we don't staff police on issues that involve their own family.
> I'd shoot you, blow you up, i'll try to cause as least amount of deaths as possible.Least amount of deaths... that would be zero.  Yet you just said you'd shoot me and blow me up because of a sentence I posted on reddit.> If you planted an explosiveAnd if I didn't, you'd torture me anyway to find out?  I just told you I had a bomb.  According to you, that's enough to torture me.
No, but rather it was terribly unreliable. You may get true info. But u may also just as likely get false info. Thats a god awful ratio of success, especially considering if the person was framed. Toture is wrong and ineffective.
the op was saying he thought ISIS would start using water boarding. my point is thats way too tame for a group that already resorts to much worse methods.
I believe situations like that are where the torturer needs to have something to lose if they're wrong.  Don't just bet the *suspect's* well being, you gotta bet your *own* as well.  That should make people think twice about the whether or not the odds call for torture/shooting the suspect/etc.
I was putting my opinion out that I think ALL actions must be judged based on the situation and the consequences, not just what the action is itself.
Oh, of course, I agree with you, but the point of the question was to determine if the morality of an act is based on the scenario and the effectiveness of the act, which is apparently not a common opinion here on /r/philosophy, since most people have concluded that it would be immoral to torture him regardless of the lives lost.The guy I replied to originally was of the view I just described.
Thank you, also, 1 c.
I don't get it? My scenario was purposely exaggurated to home the point that if it is ever moral in any situation it must be moral dependant on situation.
" Yet you just said you'd shoot me and blow me up because of a sentence I posted on reddit."You're a bit illiterate, or maybe just have a bad memory. You stated that "if [you] had a bomb on [you]," I was referring to that. "And if I didn't, you'd torture me anyway to find out? I just told you I had a bomb. According to you, that's enough to torture me."I stated that if you claimed to have or the intelligence claims that you have, and you don't willingly give directions,you'd be tortured until things are settled. 
That's not torture, that's corporal punishment.
>You said "it is bad . .. "Yes, I did. And literally the preceding sentence was>Based on your framing of the question, you're clearly a consequentialist, so I'll frame my answer that way:As in, "I do not believe this, but I will adopt your reasoning so I can show why your reasoning is faulty."If I wasn't clear that my adoption of consequentialism was only for that sentence, then that's my fault for not being clear!
You said...> **If somebody is stating that they have a bomb**, you ask them where the bomb is so you can save lives. If they don't give you an answer, you make them give you an answer. Torturing would be the most effective. I then stated...> I have a bomb. According to you, that is enough to torture me.  You said it.  So, come torture me.
>if I may ask?None, and it doesnt matter if there is a 100% success rate or not (Obviously it is garbage): you fundamentally misunderstand the point of the question. The question is there to confirm whether or not the morality of the act is based on the consequences or the act itself. From your other comment it seems you are a consequentialist like I am, where some people in the comment section think the opposite and believe even if it was garenteed to work it is still the wrong choice.
I was playing along the narrative that you initiated. You stated that you had a bomb, I stated/insinuated that if that was the case in a real life situation, i'd shoot you or if you planted the bomb somewhere, i'd try to find out where by torturing you, while other intelligence is committing their time to find out other intel. 
> fundamentally misunderstand the point of the question.You are perhaps vastly overestimating how much I care about the point of your loaded questions.
> It doesn't matter, you still just confirmed that you think the basis of the morality of torture is still based on its effectiveness and the potential gain from it, meaning you disagree with the guy who critiqued my original comment.Please identify the consequentialist statement I made so I can change the statement I made to something that does not contradict my core values.
>  You stated that you had a bomb, I stated/insinuated that *if that was the case in a real life situation*Reddit exists in reality.  Our conversation here is just as much in "real life" as if we had had it face to face.  Again, I have a bomb.  Do you feel you now have the right to torture me?  I'm just waiting for you put your money where your mouth is.  Either that or just admit/realize that deep down you know your argument is weak and invalid and is just posturing to try to sound tough.
bring on the lab grown meat.  If it costs the same and tastes the same, Im totally down for it.Im sure the "real thing" will remain highly sought after as a status symbol.
The stability brought by peace and non-aggression between humans is beneficial for the progress of our species. There is no such benefit in being kinder towards animals. It feels good to think about being kinder to animals, but doing it has negative economic consequences (opposite consequence of being peaceful with fellow humans), so I'm not really surprised we're not doing it.
I see what you're saying, but I disagree.  Killing and eating animals isn't a problem...if it is necessary for your survival.  Our society affords us ease of access to all foods, so it is hard to see the moral side of killing any animal for food these days.  It isn't necessary for our species to survive.
But what you gotta think about is, what is our definition of cruelty, is it species based, life based, intelligence based?wikipedia says "behaviour which causes physical or mental harm" and killing causes physical and mental harm, whether it is yourself, or other people around you. If you saw someone die around you, you'd suddenly get shook and scared. Its the same for the animals.
we absolutely can do things which will make sense in the future. much of what we call civilization is in actuality the machinery which we use to do those kinds of things, like plant vineyards and educate children.
I like your style. In some less developed countries the communities have erected huge contraptions (basically a large funnel with a spotlight on top) to trap and collect grasshoppers and other insects that they later fry and eat for an incredibly cheap source of protein. I can't see the downside to this. 
it should end up being cheaper... last i heard 1 gram of lab grown meat only took 14 calories to produce compared to the more than 40 it takes when raising an actual animal. they said it tastes the same, but i can't imagine a muscle not being used tasting like one that does... you eat different parts of any animal and taste the difference now; however, we do tend to prefer cuts that get used less... breasts in chicken, the loin in larger animals. 
That's actually one of the biggest draws for lab-grown meat--it must be created in sterile environments, and thus require no antibiotics at all.
Most of our modern conveniences are not NEEDED, but that does not negate or trivialize people's enjoyment of them. If there is a suitable, sustainable, and economical way to develop synthetically produced meat without any moral issue, why would that not be positive in your mind?
So, stop eating them. At least as a first step, reduce your consumption. You are essentially acting as if your hands are tied on this matter. You have no one else to blame but yourself. If you sincerely love animals but can not give up a few fleeting moments of pleasure when you know what goes into it, that speaks volumes about your will power.
It's new, like not at market research stage new. So far the main drawback is it's just meat, no fat. And like any meat eater knows the taste is in the fat. They think they can get the price down to a comparable number but that will depend on mass production and for that it has to taste as well as the real thing or people will not buy it.
When does a collection of cells become a human?
In the future, it will have positive economic consequences, because lab grown meat will be cheaper than real animals.
There is however the conservation aspect as well. Left unchecked deer etc can reproduce out of control and then either cause harm or starve if not enough food is available. 
Exactly! I'm not a vegetarian but I do have high respect for those who do so for personal principles. Living martyrs, all of them.
>  even in the cases of farmers whose main crops are vegetables and grains. 
Meat isn't a requirement for nourishment though.  In America at least, basic products like flour, milk and breakfast cereals are fortified as a matter of course in order to prevent malnutrition. If there is some nutrient so unique and valuable in meat that most people wouldn't get it without eating meat, then that would be fortified too.
No I am sorry but it is a luxury because it is not essential to maintain life. Anything that is not essential is a luxury. I like to drink alcohol, but it is not essential. Should I have the right to consume it? Yes, but I believe I should actually be taxed more for it because it is not good for me or the planet as a whole. 
I think the negative utility of painlessly killing an elderly animal raised in comfort is negligible, but due to climate change the industry needs to be completely done away with regardless.
Unfortunately the kind of reform required is so radical, given the status quo, that I doubt the current arrangement of human civilization would even attempt to accommodate it.
"Hey buddy this chicken usually costs you $10/lb, but if you let me torture it, I'll knock off a couple bucks."Brilliant and on point.  The true cost of factory farming is hidden.  Humanely sourced meat is a luxury.
existence is suffering. so i'd go with suffering less.
Does consciousness require thought?
This is the best counter point to his argument, IMO.
There's around million and one reasons not to resort in cannibalism. 
Looking for resolutions in philosophy is mistake number one.
It is totally their right to judge that a moral activity within the framework of their culture. I might not be too fond of it, and act to prevent it, but that doesn't mean it's universally immoral.
This point is spot on. I'm a vegetarian, but my main issue and the issue this article is trying to focus on is the insanity that is industrial farming. 
But, isn't that essence of the process? The whole point of evolution is to pass down favorable genes for the sole purpose of specie propagation. The desire to not be harmed can be expressed in many different mediums. Does it need to be consciously realized? 
Consumption of animal products does not cause cognitive dissonance. 
We wouldn't have a choice, unfortunately. 
I think we already have that for several exotic meats, talking about shark, ostrich, crocodile, foie gras, even veal that are routinely sold for very high prices at high end restaurants.The more taboo something is, the more someone will want it.
was this like... a pet?  bad term, but I assume a large cattle ranch would have inefficiencies that you would not.Ill also admit having no clue as to the wholesale value of a cow.
It seems a little unrealistic to me to keep it that sterile while producing meat on an industrial scale if it's not considered practical in a lab setting but maybe it can be done, I certainly hope so.
Gardien makes a great vegan burger patty
Actually we are no use to the world at all. Why should we even exist. Wouldn't it be better for the planet if we just all killed ourselves?
Not sure why people downvoted him/her.  There's clearly a /s at the end of the post.
Many would even affirm that we don't even need to take responsibility for the cruelties of other individuals.
At some point before birth. This argument isn't about humans though. At what point is an Animal considered more than a collection of cells?
Sure, but while we wait for it...Also I doubt "lab" will be the correct term. They will be factories.
I'd sign up for a good life.
Ironically, the main reason for deer overpopulation is the practice of raising animals for meat. Livestock herders killed off wolves and other predators that messed with their flocks, so now the deer population has no natural check.
I didn't say you did, didn't mean to imply that. I actually agree 100% with everything you said. However, I, as a vegetarian, have consistently had my views looked down upon by people after "coming out" to them. It seems weird that a lot of people would agree with what you said because it makes logical sense, yet turn around and write off vegetarians as butthurt hippies.I appreciate your views and the respect you say you have for vegetarianism.
Milk isn't a basic product. Humans don't need cow's milk.
I completely agree.
I don't see how consciousness can exist without thought.
You don't need animal products to survive. You can thrive on a plant based diet.
Every argument defending their consumption does, though.
You would have to accept that they have the ability to. That is different from saying that they ought to or that they have the right to. Can and should are different things.
Yes, you can say that subjectively. But from an outside perspective it bears as much weight as saying you prefer coke over pepsi. So while, to you, "lesser beings" exist, there is no objective standard that can back up that assertion. 
Not participating in an act results in the needless misery and suffering is not making a sacrifice. You are assuming that you already have an inherent right to do as you please to less powerful beings. By giving up meat, you are not making a sacrifice as you are not giving up any right of yours.
Tough to get off the high horse when you present the pros and cons like that.The environmental and cruelty concerns should easily outweigh such a base personal desire of how your food tastes.
Comparing our behavior on an ethical level to that of wild animals is pretty specious ;)
Exactly. The number of cows would slowly decrease and we wouldn't breed them as much. Ideally, people will eat lab grown meat or even just less meat (ex. special occasions). I'm not saying we should let the farm animals die off, but if there are no farm animals to be exploited, there won't be any suffering farm animals... 
The value of a 600 pound calf at the time was around 1000 and unlike most ranches we gave our cattle corn and sweet-feed, expensive but it increased the quality of the meat 10 fold compared to just hay and grass fed cattle. When we sold the meat (we did ranching more as a hobby and a way to have a reserve of food in case we got snowed in) it would sell for quite a bit more than a normal steak (think upwards of $7 per ounce, though if we wanted we could charge $10)
> I'd say most vegetarian 'hamburgers' are on par or significantly better than any fast food burgers.The problem with substituting like this is that a vegetarian burger is not going to sate my need for the fats and minerals in flesh. 
It probably would be better for the planet if humans were gone. But there is also a middle ground in which we can survive and thrive and simultaneously lessen the impact we have. 
You're right, being eaten alive sounds a lot less pleasant than being beheaded. However, if you think the life of animals who are born, raised, and killed in factory farming conditions includes no suffering but the brief pain of being beheaded (which is not even how they are slaughtered) then you are sorely mistaken. 
Simply dying is vastly different from being killed a human.  When human action is involved, morality is involved.  When an animal kills another animal, that is not a moral issue.  The reason there is a difference in human and animal action is that humans have greater capacity to reason and can behave based on what that reason leads us to determine is ethical behavior.
At some point before birth I suppose.
Rabbits, too.  They breed like, well, rabbits.All of these animals are great at turning stuff we can't eat into stuff we can eat.
That depends on how you rate the moral status of krill - they're basically insects, and a pound of wheat also requires spraying to kill huge numbers of insects too. Also, in the case of any animals that eat other animals (whether their diet is insects or more advanced animals), you could argue that humans aren't morally responsible for the actions taken by the animal itself by feeding. 
But is it worse to not consume cell phones and still eat meat? 
Humans can't eat grass. 
Small outliers don't prove the general attitude of people in farming. 
And eating meat that has been pumped with chemicals is probably not great either
It's a basic product in the sense that it is a common commodity that most people in the West consume.  So much so that the US government basically assumes people will be getting their vitamin D from supplemented milk.
What is too expensive ? I didn't even state a specific number. I am poor and I still manage to drink when I desire. 
It definitely can, and it does. You can even do it yourself. While meditating, you are still conscious and aware of consciousness, yet you are not thinking. Really experienced meditators stop thinking altogether for as long as they want.Thought is just a mechanism of consciousness.
Because you can kill me if I don't elevate you to my level.
Thats true but we have developed as omnivores with canine teeth used for meat. Are you arguing we evolve away from eating meat because it causes suffering? If its about suffering plants also feel pain. By logical progression we have now classified animals as above plants.
The act, in and of itself, does not cause the dissonance. Social constructs produce the dissonance. 
Maybe there is morality in nature? Just because you don't think there is doesn't mean it isn't a possibility.
okaywell since morality is all personal i guess that's settled then
i just like owning slaves, alright? they taste good.
I'm not a regular commentator in /r/philosophy, so my reply is out of ignorance, not some attempt to be passive-aggressive - I just want to state that up front, so you don't think I'm replying with snark.What evidence is considered acceptable to support a personal preference? I like what I like. If I showed you survey data or something would that further validate my opinion?  Or putting it another way, do you have evidence that my enjoyment of eating meat doesn't justify (to me - not to you or anyone else) my dietary habits?
What about the eviromental impact of "vegan leather" and other plastics and non biodegradeable products that vegans flock to for vanity? If animal suffering is the reason you went vegan, you need to stop consuming palm oil, and a large number of other products that lead to deforestation, or enviromental destruction. Petroleum products, rare earth minerals used in the production of microchips. You might as well just swear off all technology, and wear clothing made only of natural fibers. That is if yoyr morals are strong enough.
That happened to me too the first couple weeks. My sister was a long-time vegetarian, now a vegan, and she said not to skip the carbs and keep track of my nutrition.I wouldn't say it's difficult, it just requires more thought than I think most people are used to putting into their meals. I also feel like there's this idea that vegetarians must eat a lot of salad, and that's totally not the way to go.
Thank you for your anecdote.
<citation needed>Just curious, how is a balanced vegetarian diet unhealthy as opposed to a meat-rich one? 
I agree, animals should be treated well, until they are slaughtered for food.  100 years ago farms did pretty good at this, but taxation and regulation forced farms to come up with ridiculous production means to stay profitable, so now we have basically meat factories.
You can't measure morality.  Your 'morality' is just your opinion.  To me, it isn't immoral to catch, gut and eat a fish.  The universe designed itself so that fish carried the energy I need to survive, so I eat fish.  Sure, I could survive by eating a carrot, but I don't think I have different moral obligations to fish or carrots.  Sorry.
In my opinion we should protect natural procreation as sacred, but try to limit it and move to artificial wombs as quickly as possible.I'm not  a woman, so I should have no say over what abortion laws are. I support whatever the majority of women decide. The government has nothing to do with ethics, and neither I nor the government have anything to do with the personal ethical considerations of a woman who is faced with that kind of decision.
I don't think relying on the differential moral status of animals is very strong ground when your broader argument is that we should kill more whales--if you're ranking animals based on moral status, whales are pretty much the top of the list. Your argument here really seems inconsistent.
I suppose that depends on how much of each you consume. I buy one cell phone every few years, whereas many meat eaters do it multiple times a day.
Because you've got the stats on the attitude of all farmers right? You're gonna have to do better than that. Furthermore, what does the attitude of farmers even prove? That they depend on their business surviving for their own livelihood? Gee, I wonder if the primate will act in its own self interest or in the interest of an abstract moral cause? /s
If the tax is to have any effect at all, the point is to make it expensive so as to affect consumer behavior.
I thought meditation isn't about "not thinking." 
A young child couldn't. What does that say of their moral value?
What? This makes no sense. The only relevant question is: can we live a healthy life without meat? The answer is unequivocally yes.We can overcome our baser instincts and choose not to kill.
If you ever gave a shit about dogs being abused, then ordered a large number four, then uhhhhh ya.
... Because morality is a socially/culturally derived human construct? Because anyone with an education in biology would know the the behaviour of  living things, from bacteria to plants to animals is governed by natural and sexual selection, which are hardly moralities. 
How do you reason that killing an animal is ever justified? You have the choice between eating plants, or cutting the throat of a cow. How do you reason that cutting a cows throat is the moral way?Unless you are talking about road kill, I see no way of arguing for consumption of meat.
Are you saying humans should satisfy every desire they have regardless of consequences?  
> you need to stop consuming palm oil, and a large number of other products that lead to deforestation, or enviromental destruction.Oh yeah, and 75% of the nuts they need for their full nutrition. Because of unethical human labor and deforestation.
I'd even argue the opposite as far as future generations are concerned. Our modern industries and population growth are going to cause serious harm. People complain about what the baby boomers did all of the time, but just wait until we see the aftermath of our current generation.
And still don't... 
Do you really think rape is comparable to someone eating a hamburger?
Citation?  I've seen neither Chinese or Mediterranean food to have proportionally less meat than the "American" version.
No, taxation and regulation is not what caused this. It was better technology and demand. People wanted to pay for cheaper meat and the way to do that was to mass produce and the least costs possible.That's akin to saying that Oil spills are caused because of so much regulation that they had to skimp on costs to meet the demands of the taxes.
At least try to understand that there is no nutritional reason that you eat meat, and that it is due to taste preference alone that meat is eaten.  I think meat tastes gross, personally.I don't buy moral relativism, personally, and think that morality is absolute, but that our reason and logic have not yet discovered all of the structure of morality -- just like how math exists whether we understand it or not.
But it comes down to the individual environmental impact. The mining of oil and rare earth minerals, plastic production, and shipping by sea, compared to the environmental impact of a single humans meat consumption, taking into account the water, feed, and transportation. 
correct, but that doesn't mean the thoughts don't slow down and stop for periods of time
Calling things dumb doesn't set up a great conversation.
But his parents or siblings or grandparents or community could kill me. It's not realistic to kill and eat humans because of the conflict it would create in society, the unrest it would provoke.
All moral claims are equally false to the anti-realist (error theorist). There is nothing we can say to condemn slavery from a completely objective, desire-independent point of view. This may be unfortunate, but that is no argument that the view is not correct.I wouldn't torture a bird because it would make me sad. Torturing a cucumber would not make me sad. That's simply how I'm built. Other organisms may be built differently. And that's all there is to say on the matter.
No the question is not if we can but should we? We dont overcome yourlesser instinct by abstaining from meat. You are still killing a live being aka a plant.
Very incorrect.Animal abuse is different than consumption of animal products. Try again, please. 
Why do I think social constructs produce the dissonance? Because basic physiological mechanisms have a baseline of nutrients needed for function and they do not give a flying fuck where those nutrients come from. 
> why "meat eaters" and not "omnivarians"?> Because it's omnivores, not omnivarians. Don't try to sound smart when you're not.Well, we don't call vegetarians "herbivores."
How could you not understand the point of the comparison....?
Cheaper meat?  Can you demonstrate that steak has actually gotten cheaper, ever?  By my math, sirloin steak has went up over 2000 percent in the past 100 years.  Better technology offsets some of the taxation and regulation, but not enough to keep the prices from increasing exponentially.And no, it's akin to saying gas prices have risen because of taxation and regulation, which is true.  There are other factors, but you can't deny that there are huge costs involved in raising taxes and increasing regulation.
I eat meat because my ancestors ate meat, and I enjoy it.  I see no reason to stop.  I do not cry for the fish that died so that I could eat it, because I know that fish get eaten by thousands of animals just like me.  There is no moral problem here, unless one is invented.
I think there's definitely room for improvement in how we consume cell phones, just like how there is room for improvement in how we consume meat. Just because consuming cell phones is bad doesn't mean it's okay to consume meat, which is what I assume you are arguing. In most Western society, it is much easier and more practical to get by without eating meat than it is to not have a cellphone or a car, but I still think we can do better in terms of how cars and cellphones are consumed.
We can define things and not know how they work... I specifically alluded to this in my comment. Anyways, consciousness is generally the state of being aware of yourself and the world. It's not transient like this guy is suggesting. You can be In different states of consciousness, sleeping or meditating do use examples from above, but you're still a conscious being.  
So a child has no intrinsic value, his value is based only what he means to those who are able to kill you? If the child had no parents, siblings, friends, or anyone who cared about him, it would not be wrong to kill him?
When you buy chicken at the grocery store, you're funding the torture and murder of chickens. When you buy cucumbers, you're funding the farming of cucumbers. Why invest in sadness?
Plants do not have the necessary neurophysiology for conscious experience, they therefore do not fall under moral considerations (although they should be considered for environmental concerns).
How do you think it gets to your plate? What do you think happens? Lol
The terms omnivore and herbivore describe all animals, including humans. They refer to what an animal **can** eat. Vegetarian, vegan, and meat-eater describe what humans **choose** to eat. So all vegetarians are omnivores, because they all can gain nutrition from plants and animal flesh.
Because cows are not sentient. You'll have a tough time convincing me that killing animals for meat and products is not moral when I don't believe in objective morality. I believe in a morality governed by creatures who are able to participate in the discussion and creatures below the intellect of most apes, with some other animals of exceptional intelligence, are not given the same level of consideration by me.
>Also supplements are kind of a thing.I mean, that's true, but I'd be hardly surprised if it was environmentally unsound practices being used to create those suppliments. Also the LARGE amount of suppliments being nothing but saw-dust or whatever would also deter me from this path.
I'm not making a moral argument at all. I'm simply curious as to which has the larger environmental impact. Does a person abstaining from the use of technology have a lower impact than a person who doesn't consume meat? At the end of the day, unless a statistically significant number of people do either, neither has any real impact at all. 
> So a child has no intrinsic valueNothing has intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is an oxymoron.Our society operates largely on rules, not case-by-case situations. We decide as a civilization to say "children are valuable" because it is a highly useful and biologically reinforced maxim.
Probably not, because we have a strong concept of respect for the dead in western culture, which mirrors our respect for human life generally.If you were starving, though, I imagine it would be morally permissible.
Sadness is tastier.
You don't have to eat nuts in order to be vegan. Of course there are ways to be vegan, and still be bad for the environment, but that doesn't mean that veganism is worse than eating meat.
That's fair, but you're not "not" understanding the point of the comparison.The argument of you not viewing it as something morally wrong is 100.0% a good argument though.
> Nothing has intrinsic value.And why is that?You didn't directly answer my other question. If a child has no one who cares about him, if no one would know or care if he died, are you saying it be okay to kill him?
So it's only immoral to kill babies because we have a "concept of respect for the dead in western culture"??? What the fuck?????
I took discrete mathematics in school. It blew my mind for the first 3 weeks and then it became so fun and interesting. We would use it in class to analyze controversial statements. I've never used it since though :/
I was looking at it from boolean logic, and couldn't understand when p is True and q is False, how is p->q False.i.e. There is cream, and I don't drink coffee are the variable states....how does that translate to if there is cream then I don't drink coffee?
Truth tables get mentioned on set theory? Really don't get all the hype in this thread I thought it was common knowledge through high school
technically not a part of discrete math. 
a valid argument is obviously not necessarily true, but a valid argument is a tool you can use to determine truth, if your argument is valid, and your premises are true your conclusion will necessarily be true aswell, and invalid argument can't be used to determine if anything is true or not
Thank you, I hope you enjoy your coffee as well. 
i agree. i would totally use that. 
She is trying to apply the tools mechanically. She is using a truth table to algorithmically analyze whether the following statement is valid:```((Cream -> Coffee) & (Donut -> Coffee) & (~Cream & Donut)) -> Coffee```You may have the mental faculty to intuitively reduce the premises down to OR but that is not logically rigorous unless you prove how that follows from the antecedent. 
If a then b, i.e.: a -> bmeans that b **has** to be true, if a is true.b can be anything if a is false, and the statement would still be valid.That is why the statement is essentially '!a (or) b'
Geometry no. But we did have basics of discrete math in high school.
Nope, I watched the entire thing and I'm still none the wiser. It would be interesting to see a video that explains how this works fully though, I'm sure I could start to understand it fairly quickly.My main issue was that she glossed over why so many of them "don't matter, they are true" when there was an F in the column she was referencing. But then that's not what this video is for so that's fair enough.
I'm sure it's hard for you to imagine HAVING friends
Wish it was taught in all schools.
It's about understanding how to use a truth table, not about the logistics of drinking coffee, I don't get what your problem is.
You can't charge tens of thousands of dollars or take out student loans for a degree on common sense so no. 
You can set up truth tables for multiple propositions at once, and then test for validity by looking for counterexamples. So truth tables can in fact be used to determine whether an argument is valid.
The whole lot seems to lack a direct application.Ie. there are very few real world problems which cannot be solved without this math.Sure it's very useful as the basis of a bunch more obscure proofs in mathematics and computer science, but unlike many other fields, having a basic knowledge in the field doesn't give much utility.
Discrete Math was an AP course at my high school. If you haven't made any headway that might be a good place to start 
Outside pure mathematics, in my experience compsci students are taught discrete maths more than students ofother maths-heavy disciplines like engineering and physics. it's important to have a good grasp of it when you're studying algorithms.
Discrete mathematics is a broad term and includes graph theory, set theory, number theory, etc. More specifically you want to look into mathematical logic. 
You learned all of discrete math in one of your CS classes yesterday? Must not have been a very thorough lecture.
I am happy to hear this! I did the same as well:)
mother russia?
It translates to **If there is cream  then I drink coffee.** being false.
Even if you're drawing hundreds of lines of Ts and Fs? I'll take tableaux nine times out of ten.
Saying validity is a tool that can be used to determine truth is a stretch. The validity of an argument does not tell you about the truth (soundness) of a conclusion *unless* you have some other means of determining first that every premise is true.Outside of that specific circumstance - where something else is enabling you to determine truth - validity cannot be used to determine truth. That an argument is invalid, for example, does not tell us anything about the truth of its premises or conclusion.
No.   validity has nothing to do with the truth of claims or propositions.  Soundness is the measure of truth of all premises.  Truth tables brute force all possible truth values of a symbolized argument, to determine validity, not soundness.
Seems like a waste of time to me, I'll be done drinking all the coffee by the time she's done. 
ahhh, I see it now.the "true" for the combination then comes from the fact that the first of the two statements asserts it as true.statement 1: "this is true"statement 2: "this doesn't conflict"therefore: "yup, it's still true."
Because she's falsifying. You can't falsify the statement a->b if a isn't true.
My "Problem" is as i stated. 1. It all looks like a waste of time2. You wouldn't need to do this if you could comprehend word problems (Since in the given example it was laid out quite nicely)3. It's just a way of over complicating things and i don't see why anyone would need to do this. (unless you work IT or with computer software logic gates and the like)
1. Truth tables may be used for testing validity of arguments in sentential (as opposed to quantificational) logic.2. 1 above is true even for multi-valued logics.3. Amending what you say, you can set up truth tables for an argument with multiple propositions at once.  You don't need to look for counterexamples - the truth tables can do the work - and to CatHairandDonuts point - it can get unwieldy - but it works.4. Fortunately, we have rules for deduction we can use in a patterned manner instead.
I'm not sure that I agree. While it is unlikely that one will ever end up directly applying the knowledge gained from basic studying in this field (in that few people consciously break arguments down into logical statements and evaluate them), knowledge is not only valuable when it is directly applied.If studying logic causes one to subconsciously evaluate things more logically, whether overtly recognized or not, then it has substantial and long-lasting benefits.
Well, to be honest the critical thinking and logic it taught me is something I use every day. But have a made a truth-table since? Hell no.
I'm in the south in a very poor district. This school system is so far behind. I teach at a military rating school called JCAC, but try to help in the community where I can. We teach logic, discrete structures, malware, Exploitation, the works.
It is taught by every analytic philosophy department that I'm aware of. Valid logic is crucial for making sound arguments. Aristotle, Kant, Russell, and countless others wrote on the importance of logic in philosophy
No just the bare-bones concepts of truth tables.
Fucking turkey
Ah! Got it.
> Saying validity is a tool that can be used to determine truth is a stretch.absolutely, that's why I didn't say that, I said a valid argument is a tool for determining truth, provided you already know that the premises are true.assuming you know anything, valid arguments are useful
But the statement is that pigs fly because they have wings. Wings do not solely enable flight.
Most people would know that some winged creatures (avians) are not capable of flight. Ostriches, chickens, turkeys, etc.
> If studying logic causes one to subconsciously evaluate things more logically, whether overtly recognized or not, then it has substantial and long-lasting benefits.agree. i was joking with my friend the other day. it went like this:me: only the good die young.her: what about so-and-so? they lived a long time.me: time out, flag on the play. denying the antecedent, repeat the down.but more importantly, why would billy joel lie like that? it must be true.
If you have time and don't care about funding, maybe try setting up an after-school course for interested students.  Might possibly be able to get it in as extracurricular studies?
> I love taking arguments apart and analysing wheter they are true or not, if that's my interest should i go into discrete math?Much of discrete math will be irrelevant for that. You're probably better off with a course in critical thinking, which will cover the relevant material found in discrete math and much more. You'll find a more realistic approach to *soundness* (a stronger condition than *validity*), a more comprehensive taxonomy of fallacies, and the inclusion of inductive reasoning in addition to deductive.
No. This is not what philosophy is about. Analytic style of philosophy sucks balls, which is probably the reason why they start with this. Anyway I wish mods would delete stuff like this, it really detracts from the quality of the subrredit.
good. in the US, students get into college and don't even know how to solve a linear equation. 
I read it as 'implies.' p implies q. I guess that basically has the same meaning as 'so.'
It doesn't matter.   Arguments are deductive/valid based on structure not content.  All men are mortal.Socrates is a man. Socrates is mortal. Valid and sound. All men are cats.Socrates is a man.Socrates is a cat.Valid (same exact structure as the first) but not sound (the first premise is false).Think of validity as "assuming all the premises are true, does the conclusion have to follow?" Soundness is looking at the actual truth of the premises.
Except the overwhelming majority do fly.
Billy Joel would never.
 That first ear is tough, once you get past that you only have one ear to go. 
Of course, but I'm just on the advisory council to help shape the curriculum to be more applicable to "cyber" careers in the future. 
Thank you very much, and then after you study that stuf, do you start implementing that knowledge into your day to day critical thinking? I mean, do you start being a better choice maker? Hope you get what i mean, thanks for your comment, it was informative 
Ok, thanks!
Yeah. Implies sort of works. I've usually heard or read it described as necessarily follows. If p is true, q necessarily follows. Implies just leaves that room for possibly not being true. But P P -> Q Necessitates Q
I think the point is that you need another premisse: "If x has wings, then x can fly."
But we can agree now that wings do not mean you can fly. 
the strongest argument of them all.
That's awesome, I was suggesting if you have the time and energy to offer an after school program for interested students.  It might not be much but it sounds like it's more than what a lot of them have.
Love that book, but I barely got a C in my Logic course in college :-/ Did the teacher quote examples from the book, or just quoted it for the hell of it?
Both actually.  She used it as prime examples when going over the logic of true if/then statements.A C is still passing which means you paid enough attention to learn something from it :)  Sometimes its just a bad time for you and other times its the teacher not making the subject interesting enough to capture the mind.
Yes there is an errounous assumption that Machiavelli advocated dictatorship but as I understand it he was for a republic.
His conclusion doesn't really answer the question he asks either, "what makes a good ruler? ... Pay attention to your politicians!"
Frank Underwood?  Is that you?
Was he a bad hombre?
You didn't listen to the part about masks. 
You mean free?
You are not necessarily wrong, even though you're being downvoted. There is a long tradition of viewing Machiavelli's The Prince as ironic. Recent scholarship doesn't go that direction any more though, so I'd suggest to look up some recent sources and see whether you still think that to be the case.
I agree. I should probably send a short email to the creator about this- the flickering is tolerable for me, but it gets distracting in some occasions. 
His dream was that Lorenzo would use his advice to unite Italy. If we are to follow his logic, the form of government to attain this goal matters little, as long as the ruler can achieve it.Republics in the Renaissance were also not democratic at all, the Medici family had held Florence as a republic for a while before they turned it into a duchy.
Yes it does :D , I should have tacked on at the end of my comment that the end of the video makes mention of this, and yes, enormous. haha
When I say "was written for", I intended, that he "dedicated" the prince "To the magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De' Medici". My apologies for my choice of words, and the misunderstanding. 
That's the way I read it
Sure he did. He said it was entirely subjective so instead he was going to talk about what Machiavelli had to say on the subject. "The Prince" is entirely about how to be a good leader, or rather, how to maintain control, survive, and achieve personal glory in a pragmatic and realistic manner. This guidebook was how to be a "good" leader.
Me too. That hand was so distracting. 
He has a lot of audiobooks on there, The Art of War, The Epic of Gilgamesh, Hammurabi's code, along with plenty of less famous ancient writings, definitely a good resource, and if you are a big history nerd he does have a bunch of other stuff on there.
Sounds like he was a good hombre! 
That's the shallowest most simplistic interpretation, worse than even Trump could give.No, books in philosophy, and particularly in political philosophy, do not become outdated. He's absolutely NOT describing an "unethical" way of ruling, you seem to be missing his focus on the welfare of the people. It's funny how ignorant people disregard HIS OTHER BOOK, which you clearly haven't read, which praises the Republic and Republican Freedom. But, hey, let's talk about stuff we have no idea about yay!
Yes, it's free because it's almost 500 hundreds years old, thus belongs in the public domain. 
Do you have a source for Obama saying that? I really doubt any smart politician would openly admit to studying Machiavelli 
Sure I'll take a look definitely. But, honestly it's hard to know what is the truth and what the author meant, since it was written so long ago, reinterpreted countless times, etc. etc. Though it is interesting to stay aware of all interpretations I guess.
That could all be just a face he presents to the public. Though I think Trump's leadership style leans *very heavily* on advisors, since he is clearly out of his depth on some matters, like foreign policy. 
I was under the assumption that he wrote it in a mocking manner.  As if people in power thought this way regarding the end justifying the means.   Do anything within your power to consolidate and expand your power.   He certainly wasn't part of the powerful class and wouldn't have advocated such a position. 
Being respected (even if that respect is earned through fear) is hardly exclusive of being a tyrant.I believe respect is synonymous with approval in this regard.
The English version looks wrong... In French it's the same as Italian: La fin justifie les moyens.
He absolutely did say it.
Sorry, I was a bit confused because when reading "Lorenzo de Medici" I assumed you meant the Magnifico (the guy who loved corporate social responsibility) and not Lorenzo *di Piero* de Medici :)
Machiavelli had the Borgia on his mind, he hoped for him to succeed and made the book (out of a letter exchange) for Cesare Borgia. Unfortunately for Machiavelli, Cesare Borgia died too soon.Well, now what? He had a good gift. Why not use it to regain the favor of the Medici? That's why he dedicated the book to Lorenzo Piero de Medici soon after Giuliano di Lorenzo de Medici (the guy who tortured and sent Machiavelli to basically an exile) died.
Well maybe you and I define answering a question differently, but if you say that the only way to answer how to be a good leader is by sloppily quoting Machiavelli I'd disagree.
Free audiobook: Dude sounds like Kermit the Frog with a fake english accent.  Checks out.
It's interesting that in Frederick the Great's Anti-Machiavel one of his major points is that many of Machiavelli's points no longer apply in the 18th century, that political realities have changed. "All these things produced a so general and so universal a change, that they make the majority of Machiavel's maxims inapplicable to our modern policy. It is what this chapter shows. I will now bring some examples of them."
I'm surprised this doesn't get brought up more often. It really is a despicable book of strategies to manipulate and dominate at any cost.
He is speaking of political ideals in Feudalism. I believe that a lot if his ideology is no longer applicable to the modern world.
Real Democracy = no leaders. You can have a role model and what not but a LEADER means you are being told what to do and/or how to live. Sorry, but mankind is better off without leaders.
More like ethical over greed.
I guess that is true, there's no harm in knowing. I should have said that they shouldn't follow his ideals.
Not taking a class.
I thought it was not copyright was why. There are translations that are copyright of his. 
Awesome! Feels good to achieve that, thank you for reading.
I too would like a source for Obama saying that, that would be very interesting news... 
cheers mate, any read of the Prince is worth it. It's probably one of the most awesome books ever
Plato and Aristotle surely did. Democracy was generally viewed as a the rule of the plebs - a rule that defines itself through a general state of insecurity, because it is based on self-interest rather than the common welfare.Thats why Plato argued for the rule of "philosopher kings" and Aristotle for an hybrid form of Oligarchy and Democracy. For Rome: You have Polybios who defines the Ochlocracy  as the coerciely following step to Democracy and thus creates an hybrid form of monarchich, aristocratic and democratic elements in an attempt to break the circuit of constitutions.
It's not just a persona. Look at everything Trump has said his entire life and the tremendous respect he's gained from everyone. His entire life he's been consistent in showing a deep concern for the American people and has a record of being unselfish despite what the media wants you to believe.
I cannot reasonably see *The Prince* as a work of satire, given it was a piece produced by Machiavelli to win the favour of Lorenzo II. Machiavelli really, really loved his home city of Florence, and just could not stand being exiled from it, so he quickly penned the piece to prove his usefulness to Lorenzo, so that he could be recalled. Given this, it would not make sense for *The Prince* a work of satire, unless Machiavelli thought Lorenzo was incredibly dumb. The piece might be at times disingenuous or a work of some sycophancy to the Medici family, but it is probably not satire. 
hahaha Machiavelli is pretty cool in Brotherhood that's for sure
Quote him saying that, please. 
Haha, no problem, I should have written my comment better,  Lorenzo the Magnificent was a work of art though (Really though, that stern look in his bust is something). 
He wrote the book 7 (SEVEN) years after Cesare's death, as it's stated in his letter to the Vettori, his friend and an ambassador in Rome. What he hoped for was to gain the favour of the Medici, so that he could be back in Firenze's politicsAnd these aren't speculations, pure facts he himself tells us about in the aforementioned letter
>  but if you say that the only way to answer how to be a good leader is by sloppily quoting Machiavelli I'd disagree.Nobody said this is the *only* way the answer "what makes a good leader?". It is one way to explore the question, since The Prince is arguably the most famous book written solely to answer it.Also the title of the video acts as a motivation to discuss the Prince, since the subject of the book is how to be a good leader. This doesn't mean the intention of the creator was to answer the question at all. He's simply saying "Here's Machiavelli's answer to it".
If you don't know who he is he has ~half a mil subs on his anti-feminism channel
> I hate the idea that a ruler cannot be a good ruler and a good person at the same time, and that is one of his core ideals.That's completely wrong. What he says is more that it is fine to be a good person as a ruler, but do not put being a good person above what is pragmatic. If doing something unvirtuous is necessary for the greater good, then do so. But also don't go around being a bastard for the sake of being a bastard, because that will simply ruin your reputation and will ferment rebellion against you. 
I think very little in the book is despicable - it's a treatise of social realpolitik. If you are completely oblivious to that mode of thinking, you might be eaten. 
The Prince does not focus on draconian aspects of feudalism. It lays out Machiavelli's thoughts about how one might successfully gain and hold power. Further, how to govern well and some advice on military tactics.These lessons are still applicable today. The nature of power has not changed.
a real democracy can't excist... not with a big population and complexity there is in the modern day, so it's irrelevant to talk about real democracy in the modern day, the representative democracy is here for that reason. I think the real democracy can still work in a smaller population group, like maybe up to 100 people at a time? but we are not living in stone age anymore.
Yes, absolutely. There's nothing wrong with being pragmatic; our world's problems stem from greed, which almost inevitably ends up overgrowing both ethics, and pragmatism.
I mean I don't think it should be controversial, but it definitely would cause a hubbub if the president admired to studying Machiavelli
I never said I thought he didn't read it, but it would be bad publicity for him to openly call it one of his favorite books
Hi, I'm still waiting for a response.
In that case, he seems like a genuine man who feels for the American people, but is not concerned with details. He will rely on the advisors to make up for his lack of thorough political knowledge and disinterest in details. 
This is what I was taught, I don't believe Machiavelli would have bothered to write a manual otherwise.
Machiavelli writes at one point that the prince, the ruler, should maintain some sort of positive public image. Even though he should be ready to do bad things, he should avoid being vilified. That is why a prince needs a good minister/advisor to do the dirty work while the prince can remain unscathed.Of course Niccolo had himself in mind for the job. When he sent his treaties it was as a gift, but he also offered his own services to get back in a position of power.
Are you sure MOST scholars believe it's satire?
It's written in Italian because he wanted to produce it as fast as possible, and have it digestible very quickly. The book was an attempt to win favour in the new Medici court after Machiavelli had been exiled, and he wanted to be recalled from his exile as soon as he could.
Ah, thank you, rereading it now, I may have to rewrite my question... (A down-vote for thanking someone? dafuq)
You are kinda pedantic. Of course he hoped to gain the favor of the Medici again. But it's an undebatable fact that he has Cesare Borgia in his mind as a kind of "model".
Alright, I agree.
Well, he still sounds like a half-english Kermie.
Oh, I'm aware there are sociopaths and that these are the instruments of their trade. I even know how to play the game when absolutely necessary. It just seems a bit disgusting to me to train in it.It's a little like the difference between training in how to fight for self defense and training in how to execute nothing but deceptive, crippling and, lethal blows. I would prefer to win honorably.
Yes, the philosophy is applicable because its philosophy. The ideals remain the same throughout time. But in The Prince he makes soo many specific examples to past lords and rulers and kingdoms that its hard to apply it to our time.As for his ideals, I know that they stay true with time, however, because the circumstances are vastly different, it would be unwise to apply them to our time.
Yes, you said it yourself, decentralized democracy! This is ideal.However, this is also the first era of history in which we can establish a direct democracy throughout a nation of any size. How hard can it be to set up online polls instead of a Congress (which struggles to work if it ever works at all)? And voting booth distributed everywhefe for people without internet. It would be easier and better for the people.Unless you make the argument "ohh but the people are inherently stupid". This idea is inherent to the system it exists in, representative democracy.
I can see how you come to this conclusion that he isn't concerned with details but he's actually written a very detailed book of his policy visions for America in Crippled America. The truth is, talking specific strategy for policy when campaigning doesn't translate into votes and isn't strategical. I'd encourage you to go to his website to read more about his plans, but yes I would agree he lacks some political knowledge but to me that trade off is worth it considering he is the best chance in cleaning up corruption in Washington.
>  these directives are expressly aimed at slowing this process down.Prove to me they work. 
That has nothing to do with the fact that it was written **for** him. I wrote what you just repeated in the first message sent
Not to be that guy, but as I recall, (I read the book almost 5 years ago) he said that it is best to be both loved and feared, but if you had to choose one, you should choose to be feared.
Also I didn't downvote you, and they are not downvoting you based on opinion, they are downvoting you because you're displaying incredible amounts of certainty for your obvious lack of contact with the field.Also, by saying "objectively immoral political philosophy" when you apparently have no idea how to use none of those 4 words.
They're tools. Nothing more, nothing less. You can use them for good or evil. 
You are incorrect.
*Most* people *are* actually hopelessly stupid. You know this. Do you really trust your neighbor, your boss, or even your cousin to vote for what's *best* for the nation?
They are employed daily by people in positions of authority and with power over your life.  I'm not sure what you want from me.
Ain't that what I said pretty much? But yeah.
How would you string them together? How I said it was perfectly correct.And thanks for not downvoting, my comment on that was directed to everyone.
The problem begins when you begin to view *other people* in this way.
Damn, I give up. Thanks for persuading me, I was such an idoit before.
^proof that I'm only being personally attacked.
This is the one argument that is truly impossible to disprove until we try a direct democracy.However, I believe that such political ignorance is inherent only to the system, and not the the people in it.
hey, glad I could help :) I studied at a University (in Germany tho), just handed in my master-thesis :) 
There are many maxims used by people in power.   Some use the Art of War.   Some use How to Win Friends and Influence People.   Some use the Bible.   Some use Pink Floyd lyrics.   Some use what their parents taught them.   Can you show me one maxim in Machiavelli that isn't obvious,  but is demonstrably more effective than other, perhaps contradictory lessons? 
Mostly, yeah, but I thought I'd clarify the quote a bit since that section of the book is a bit more nuanced than Fear > Love.
"Objective" doesn't mean what you think it means: it doesn't mean "without bias" nor does it mean "in reality", it is not a synonim of "actually" or "really". It means "related to the nature of the object qua object". You're using "objectively" as a synonym of "really". The word is not doing any work in the phrase that you said it in. I think you were looking for a word more like "inherently".Also "morality" is not the object of political philosophy.
I don't think anyone here is under the illusion they could persuade you of anything you've already decided is wrong. They're merely trying to prevent your obstinacy from spreading. 
You stated it your self that decentralized democracy would be ideal, so thats a pretty good indicator on your view about the subject? Anything else is a contradiction.
Oh that's awesome, lol now I love the username even more
I think thats a loaded question.  Personally I use all three and try to live my life like Jesus would (the man, not the son of "God").I find this accumulates power and fortifies it.    I cannot say any one wisdom is better or more clear beyond all others.   I will say I employ his techniques often, and use his writings to recognize when people are using these things against my goals. 
No, I am simply trying to prevent the eventual argument that I always have with people on reddit "ohh but Morality is subjective to your own view". And Morality has everything to do with politics.
I dont expect everyone to follow my ideology. Not many do.
So you believe that any form of decentralized democracy is completely impossible? Because that's what you've narrowed it down to so far.
haha thank you :D sometimes its important to take a strong stand :)
As long as no one starts telling me I'm wrong for loving Thug Notes, I can continue on surviving.
I was expecting further reading. Instead I got the episode told back to me without the jokes. 
Easy views. People are desperate for rick and morty content. 
For real.  This was, bar none, the absolute worst episode of the show.  Worst.  Unfunny, ridiculous, meaningless BS.  It felt like a leftover script for an unmade episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and it probably was.
so are these comments
Sophistical refutations
I found that to be the best part, that all of that cult following occurred in a matter of hours. 
Nice ad hoc hominem hoc cogito culina fallacy there.
I thought what morty meant by "come watch tv," was    just to accept your reality no point in fighting it because it gets you nowhere.
What? It's about the horrors of addiction.
You're wrong for loving thug notes
This is what happens whenever a video from a channel I am subscribed to ends up on Reddit. I wouldn't have the confidence if I were the Nerdwriter after on of his last videos ended up on the front page. 
Welcome to Wisecrack nowadays. 
More like "here's the idea of logical fallacies"...    His other videos (notably Bo Jack Horseman and the actual Rick and Morty episode) are way better than these. This seems more like a filler episode.
It's not even non academically rigorous. It asks a few misleading questions in a pretentious tone and goes nowhere most of the time.
Really? What I got from this video is that the thought processes related to religion are not exclusive to them. Anyone can fall into the same fallacies to justify their beliefs. 
Not everything has to be about Trump. There are so many other places to get your fix
If that's the one with Camus, you can actually learn something from that video. I've actually referenced it a few times, it's great. 
>Existential.The show has better content than vague existential pondering.
That's totally not the point of the comment above yours. This video may be irritatingly indulgent over rudimentary bs, but I think most fans of the show still find it a good episode. A tip: Just because something, anything, is uninteresting to you does not make that thing meaningless.
It's a lot of exposure.  Like, Stargate SG1 went for hundreds of episodes without changing the world by letting people know about aliens and the stargate... for  no good reason.  Other than it makes the world less relatable to the audience.But by S02's cliffhanger, the world kinda jumped way ahead and accepted Galactic Federation rule.  Prior to that, the Giant Head thing was the only case where the world was aware an alien situation was a thing.
It's always the same Rick and Morty. The family may change, but it's been the same Rick and Morty since episode 1. 
Yeah the Ice-T story was just random and silly.  I didn't "get" that part at all.  I just try to forget that part.
"My doctor said I have cancer""Lol nice appeal to authority. Take a logic class." 
OK, what is something you would consider deep within pop culture?
Wrong, you're disagreeing for the sole reason of being a contrarian. The satire of the final statement, "come watch TV" is obviously lost on you. 
I don't get why people are complaining that much. Sure it's one of the worst ones. But every show has its worst ones.
Because they said one aspect of it as if that was the only one.
Same happened to me before a while ago but with a music theory video. I expressed how disappointed I was that the channel couldn't be trusted and suddenly there were people defending its claims. I guess it's just fun to criticise things like this negatively, makes you feel superior to it. 
That's been every wisecrack episode since forever.
Which wisecrack video covers the actual Rick and morty episode?
Perfectly logical scientific theories can be built upon foundations of illogical subconcious presuppositions.That's why science without philosophy is so potentially dangerous. 
> you can recognize it and ignore it.Yeah, no. The trash makes it not worth it, just like /r/atheism, /r/TwoXChromosomes, etc.
.....You might say he experiences...Confirmation BiasSorry
Current events doesn't just mean Trump
But then you'd have to learn something about camus. So who's the real loser?
A tip for you: my opinion is just as valid as yours, and I'm every bit as entitled to it as you are.Don't condescend to people, friend. It just makes you look like a patronizing asshole.
I think it'd be helpful to consider the vast difference in purpose and message between the two shows you're comparing here.
how do you explain mr poopy butthole?
There's nothing to get. It is random.
That's just like your alternative facts, man...
Eternal Sunshine, at least on an emotional level. Most of Charlie Kaufman's work, actually. 
Lmao I like Rick and Morty it's a funny show. I don't think it's as good as a lot of people here would have you believe but it's definitely a solid TV show. I don't see what that has to do with disagreeing that the quote isn't great as a serious piece of philosophy.
Holy fuck. You need to get your head out of your ass. "I feel like there's people who love R&M for the right reasons" ROFL.
Name one. 
How is it shitty and outdated? I'm curious what makes it shitty, and if it's outdated, what superseded it?
On Reddit it does. 
As if I wanted to life in a world where I wouldn't be able learn about Camus 
I'm sorry that you mistook my comment for condescension, but it wasn't. I was pointing out the difference between opinion and objective fact. To call something meaningless which is not is objectively wrong, and to word it as though the person you're responding to was making the same point when they weren't is rude and rather manipulative.
Well the ratio of shows where everyone KNOWS about aliens (or ghosts or super-powers) vs ones where only the main cast knows is pretty low.
He's been there the whole time!
> "The family may change, but it's been the same Rick and Morty since episode 1.
Its only basis was the NAME "Ice-T".  Then it's, like, "let's make him an alien crystal of actual ice who doesn't care".  "Oh, oh, can he come from a planet of letters-and-substances?"  "and they're at war with number-planet!"  "and then he cares enough to save Earth!"Yeah, that meshes with the plot perfectly.  It's like a \[WP\] where they qualified the entry with the most DOWNVOTES.
Well I wasn't commenting on you disagreeing with the quote. I was commenting on you saying it's a show for pseudo intellectuals. And not as good as people would have you believe..?I think you mean to say you don't like it as much as other people. Because just because you don't love the show doesn't mean people who love the show are wrong lmao
Phrenology, social darwinism, eugenics
It's absurd to want to learn about Camus. Just imagine yourself happy not learning about Camus. 
> to word it as though the person you're responding to was making the same point when they weren't is rude and rather manipulative.In my reading I missed the word "analysis" and believed the poster was talking about the episode. Such a misunderstanding is neither rude nor manipulative.Stop being judgmental!
in that universe, yes.
What makes you think it followed a different timeline? Honestly asking, trying to figure out if I missed something.
I dunno. I love surrealism. We need another show like aqua teen.
If you mean the term "scientism" you might prefer the term "scientific expansionism".  I would agree that the term is less inherently confusing since you would naturally tend to want to call a practitioner of "scientism" a "scientist" which would naturally be conflated with a simple practitioner of the scientific method but "scientific expansionist" would not cause the same confusion.
left wing economics The subconcious presuppositions being A: if we didn't force people to share their wealth then they wouldn't, at least not to the degree that's "necessary"B: the very act of forcing people to share their wealth is not actually responsible for the vast majority of resentment for the poor and rampant greed/selfishness we see in the world today.C: mandatory compassion is not actually dehumanizing compassion itself by putting a giant middle man between the people doing the helping from the people being helped.
With your application of the word, we are all being judgmental pretty much always, particularly when having discussions like this on reddit. Try not to take it so hard when someone responds to you and instead consider what they are saying.
I don't believe this but that's not to say it isn't possible. I think the episode is worth a watch with this concept in mind. I'd expect these kind of hidden plots from the show. 
The existentialist posturing came from the claim at the start of this thread that the joke (that has nihilistic roots at bare minimum) was somehow "deep"
I was on mobile. I meant to write scientism. I mean that scientism is a stupid thing for people to be, but the fact that the comic attacks the scientific method itself rather than the more pressing issue if people who are into scientism thinking science is the *only* way to get information is eyebrow raising. Also telling someone to "look up" the fact that a certain pejorative exists is a bizarre thing to say.
>A: if we didn't force people to share their wealth then they wouldn't, at least not to the degree that's "necessary"I see this as the most important and relevant of the three points, a pity it has a big fat qualifier on the end of it (that you even put scare quotes around).
Its trying to answer two questions, one of which there is probably no reason to even ask, and the other which it answers incorrectly. The first question being about some vague thing your life is inherently ordered towards, (doesn't matter. Defaults don't mean anything, read about morality or value instead) and the second being about radical freedom to make any choice. (Heavily disregards social context so much that it leads to misleading conclusions about agency).
Allright you seem like someone who actally understands what he is talking about so how is existentialism outdated? Has anyone proved that life has meaning and we are here for a reason? Or is that just accepted as true in the philosophy community its just that some other aspects of existentialism are shitty and outdated?
That last part, you forget they've done two episodes with multiverse television. 
So we're not just brains?
Could you expand on the idea of minds only existing? Its an interesting thought
> conscience gives you an impression that **you** are somebody when in fact everybody is nobody.But how can consciousness give the impression to "you" if you are nobody?
Acknowledgeing your biology doesnt cheapen your existence! Humans are amazing enough with out having to apply made up stuff to make us seem better 
You are the consciousness produced by your brain. 
personally, i've seen so many objections to this and it is completely surprising to me. I'm in the habit of just thinking everyone understands that science has shown that it is not only plausible, but *likely* that consciousness is nothing but an emergent property of a completely materialistic brain. 
Hmm... Im not sure I agree with that equation!
because it leads here to believe that things like "beliefs" do not exist. it's definitely counterintuitive to say the least
I've never understood how people like Dennet can say that the hard problem of consciousness doesn't exist, could you potentially elaborate on how that's possible? 
The way you phrased awareness interfacing with the brain implies that awareness is something that could exist independent of the brain. Like perhaps your awareness could float off after your brain dies and maybe interface itself with someone else's brain. Or perhaps float off to some place like Heaven or Hell. I think the brain produces a lot of patterns, one of which is an awareness of your self. But when the brain dies, all the patterns are gone also.
We shall disagree on how we define 'stretch' in that context. 
What you're asking about is just about the entirety of Kant's work. I know this doesn't answer your question, but Kant is comparable to Einstein in respect to what he accomplished, intellectually, for philosophy. Picking up a guide to Kant's ideas would be worth the money and answer your questions.  
I'm merely drawing the logical conclusion one gets if you accept (as I do) that:* our brains are biological computers* there is no ghost in the machineIf you are willing to abandon the notion of a soul, there is nothing left to drive our actions save the inputs our brain gets, and what the cogs therein do with them.
If you program a car to stop at stop signs. Does it get to choose to stop? Does that mean it has free will?Free will is, "the ability to choose between different possible courses of action". I don't think **we** get to choose. Our genetics and environment does, which is deterministic.
> Surely we could narrow it down a little bit further.How do you propose we do that?
Like a coma patient with built in VR. Things like temperature, the feeling of height, the feeling of weight and pain. All the stuff that keeps us grounded and under the impression we are a person.
> There are plenty of psycho-active drugs that will produce, eliminate or substantially change your "hopes and dreams", so that kind of is an empirical evidence.> Likewise specific types of brain trauma impairs specific mental abilities, such as emotions, planning, execution.This only confirms that the brain is an organ and that effects are felt if it is damaged or if things are done to it for ex. the ingestion of drugs. If I were to damage your heart or give you certain drugs, you would also experience certain effects, it doesn't mean that you're just a heart. 
> Most people still think their mind and their body are two separate things. Most feel that there's more to their "self", something that is not material, and not deterministic. And they based this on nothing more than just "this is how it feels to me". Is that a pre-philosophical/pre-analytic intuition, or one that people acquire after being *taught* dualistic concepts and worldviews?
in your opinion you need a brain to have consciousness? I believe plants have some level of conciousness for example. 
It's equivalent to saying that in the scope of an entire multi-verse the odds of our universe existing at any one time would be the same as it existing at any other regardless of whether it already existed once.
It says beliefs are products of culture+evolution+brain chemistry. I fail to see how it doesn't reconcile with other philosophy.
Howsa'bout this?  We are a bunch of atoms that got together and created a mind that became curious what atoms are so the mind built a GIANT partical accelerator and smashed atoms together to see if it could figure out what atoms are.Like WTF are these atoms DOING?  They are insane.
Consciousness is like the economy. You can't point at the economy because it's a group of functions, an emergent property.That's my favorite straightforward analogy. Comes from the neuroscientist who did The Brain on PBS a year or two ago.
He essentially thinks that once we learn more about how the brain works we will understand the exact nature of consciousness, so it won't be a problem in the sense that Chalmers meant when he coined the term.
it doesn't look like anything to me...
The capacity for subjective experience most likely is favored, but I think most people are interested in the mechanism which allows subjective experience to occur.
Yeah, maybe you're the software that got downloaded into the hardware that is the brain when you were born, and it constantly uploads backups to a different unit when you sleep, so that if you die you get installed in a different hardware or something.
Certainly. And this begs the question: "What" is your post "made of?" To me its very obvious that your post is more than black pixels. Its the thought *behind* the post, the *information,* the thing *not made of pixels.* 
with a valid argument?
Dualism had to come from someone who hadn't been taught it, and the only place they would have gotten it would be pre-philosophical/pre-analytic intuition. Considering the prevalence of souls/spirits in completely disparate cultures, it seems to be not only the popular and dominant view, but actually the natural world view.
I think it is more that this unique ability to live inside our own minds distorts our perceptions of reality too much.  Thoughts are incredibly powerful, and the belief systems we have built into ourselves are also incredibly powerful.  It is one reason I was always very interested in Buddhism and the philosophy around not-thinking.  Your thoughts lay your internal reality over the external reality, and we give more weight to our internal one.  Philosophy is such a crazy thing...  I love it!
I see - so you're more of an idealist? What then, is "the table" when 5 conscious beings are standing in a room touching a table?  Is the table consciousness?  If so, how does this help us learn about the nature of reality in comparison to physics and neuroscience?  In a dream, for example, there is no mind-independent table, so the analogy seems to break there.Please don't take my questioning as an assertion in the opposite direction - I am genuinely curious.
We disagree.
So maybe awareness is being picked up like a radio signal, but I find that a less convincing hypothesis. 
eliminative materialists believe that "beliefs" are a part of folk psychology and have no place in mature neuroscience. they believe "beliefs" do not really exist. Insofar as "belief" is a central notion in epistemology it is quite radical. and incoherent I might add.
And those guys are working really hard to keep us together. True bro love and respect 
The nervous system stretches all throughout the body, though, and keeps the brain in contact with the rest of the body. Where do you draw the line between the part of the nervous system that is me and the part that is not me? Are the nerve endings that indicate I'm currently touching my keyboard less "me" than the somatosensory cortex they're connected to?
That is, of course, assuming that it's some more complicated form of circuit based logic. Ironically, it's probably beyond our ability as humans to understand, but a computer could probably figure it out, given the high precision observation tools we don't have.
Some people who are computer illerate believe computers have consciousnesses who perform actions on their own. They don't really have consciousness but their lack of knowledge creates an illusion that they do. What if our appearance of consciousness is more of our lack of understanding of our brain 
It's the use of the frontal lobe to simulate metaphysical things. Evolution doesn't favor better or even good things only thing that allow propergation.Advanced simulation of reality is good for survival what it does on the side is just a thing
Why wouldn't it feel like something?
Well, that could explain transsexuals. female software in a male hardware body.
Or you can imagine that you're experiencing pure awareness.
Most of our memories are inaccurate, or blatantly wrong anyways.
ohh and just to clarify i dont believe that the universe is created from the ground up by a divine being like how we created tables. i think that a set of rules is set and then over time based on these rules the universe assembles. so theres no conflict between what weve figured out with science. 
i guess plants and brainsless animals such as medusas have some level of conciousness, maybe is not the conciousness you mean, to me its a form. Sunflowers move to face the sun pretty fast, they sense it and they move. Thats a level if awareness, Ours is more complex I know. what im saying may not make sense or yes :)
I must have misread the article then.
But the electrons and protons etc aren't really working at all. They're just doing what they do, letting it all happen, hanging loose, and look what's happening!
This is a tough idea to continually keep together because what if our perception truly does affect how the universe responds and changes?  Oddly the Grateful Dead addressed this in a song in the 1970s called "Eyes of the World."
One of the best attempts at an answer is the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "Godel, Escher, and Bach". It's the author's attempt at explaining how what we think of as "consciousness" arises naturally from complex groups of neurons. 
Yeah, this is simply a poor explanation of the hard problem of consciousness. This is closer to a soft problem of consciousness. Moves the goal posts significantly. It's simply wrong in that it assumes the hard problem goes away with adequate explanation. This is akin to saying, "with more syntax, we'll eventually derive semantics." The hard problem is that science lacks a capacity to discuss qualia, and we cannot figure out a framework that is even capable of discussing both science and qualia. No matter how much science you have, this problem doesn't go away.
I was about to reply to you about how you could make a bot that actually looks at the graphics and analyzes it's lush surroundings to understand what's going on, but I'm dropping that in favor of this:> Why aren't we bots processing the data with nothing going on inside?This is what it boils down to. You are saying there is something "going on" inside us humans that isn't explainable if you reduce human intelligence to it's physical parts.I disagree. :)
Show me the crankshaft that drives on a cross country road trip. Show me the axle that wins the Indy 500.   Except what you're talking about is even smaller than that. I'd say 'show me the specific screw or bolt', but even that is too big comparatively. You're saying something like 'show me which of these atoms in the tire is responsible for the car being able to drive'.
The other side states "because I have evidence that they are" .
Which of his works specifically?
Yeah. Once I started learning about AIs, and then for the class I literally wrote a neural network that learned facial recognition even though I didn't actually understand how it was doing it, that was the point where I fully realized and accepted that brains are almost definitely just really complicated computers. Honestly that makes consciousness more amazing to me though, the fact that we have emotions and thoughts and consciousness, because of information processing. 
I'd counter that by saying *consciousness* is the only thing that exists.All the other things which you may think to be more real only actually exist in your consciousness. 
Saying where it is and what it does still doesn't tell you the mechanism involved. Until we can replicate it artificially in the lab to some extent, subjective experience will continue to be an open problem. 
I think the thought is this (correct me if I'm wrong): planets as far as we know do not experience pain if they smash into each other. Conscious entities, like us, do (usually). Why are conscious entities even equipped with this ability to experience phenomenological things like "pain" when we smash into each other? If we are just a conglomerate of little things, why is it that we differ in this regard when things like planets are also groups of little things?
Holy shit. I never thought of that. 
I dont think it's necessarily anything inherent in eliminativism that makes it "radical," more that a lot of philosophers (in my estimation) are more impressed by functionalism. At least, when I was more interested in philosophy of mind that seemed to be the case.
"i regard matter as derivative from consciousness" -max planck
The Universe, without consciousness, is a field of dead stars spinning, groaning planets twitching and shrugging with volcanism, and black holes rippling towards a final end. Without consciousness, the Universe is exactly what it is, minus a few particularly complicated chemical reactions sloshing around on the surface of one planet - maybe more. It's marvelous, and we're very small. I guess that's how I feel, anyway.
How accessible is that book? 
That could all be calculated without producing an immersive simulation then inserting a being (us) that inhabits the simulation
Yep maybe it was chalmers? Who wrote the piece about the psychologist who understood everything about colors, but lived in a black and white room and never understood the slightest experience of color
I find it liberating. To an exetent conciousness is the universe in a wholly nonmagical way.
So what's your definition of subconscious?
Because in order for us to survive, we need to make decisions and take actions based on feelings like pain and pleasure. A planet does not make decisions or take actions.
I think a lot about how we won't be missed if at this very moment the earth was destroyed by an asteroid or any other cataclysmic event.  Not only won't we be missed but I think about how meaningless the last seconds of any of our lives really would be.  So the world ends and right beforehand I was sitting in front of a computer pretending to be busy at a job I don't like.  Useless.  Meaningless. 
It's an intimidating work, deep and quite broad in subject matter. The author builds on material as the book progresses and attempts to bring you in from a novice level of simpler concepts so as to ease the burden. But I found myself re-reading whole sections of the book just remind myself what I was even reading about(especially the concept of "enumerably recursive systems") 
Not sure we are in a position to rigorousley define it
How sure of your assertion that planets do not make decisions are you? A planet could be viewed as a large set of numerous smaller systems.
If a cell is just a bunch of chemicals that hit a exponential growth curve in complexity and chemical evolution, I bet the same thing can happen in like an interstellar gas cloud or some unknown strange environment somewhere out there in the universe, but in a way that we wouldn't recognize as life.  Kind of like the conscious 'fart' from Rick and Morty. I bet something like that is possible.
I try to have these kind of conversations with my friends / family, but they are quick to answer blandly and discard the subject...Are things better on your end?
To add some more weight to your point there, I believe you meant "recursively enumerable"
> A planet could be viewed as a large set of numerous smaller systems.Well, it lacks any form of control or feedback mechanism though, beyond mere physics or actual life.
Yes, I don't try to discuss them with anyone. 
Shit, I was afraid I had that backwards. Thanks lol
Well, it's not quite that specific. Recursive enumerability is a property of formal systems which are capable of self-description. It describes languages that have valid sentences and non-valid sentences that can be distinguished from one another using a certain grammar or algorithm. I realize that probably doesn't clear anything up but this stuff is nearly impossible to explain in simple terms. 
First time I've ever seen a "Thunk" and looking forward to more.edit--holy shit there's already 113 more.
Hmmm. I don't believe you. 
That's what skeptics **DO.**
That's not what the principle claims. It only implies that we are *in a position to know*, not that we *actually do know.*
That's the spirit!
Could you elaborate on how your skepticism led into the understanding of faith and mysticism? Genuinely interested
Unfortunately, almost every actor pushing forward a proposition has at least one thing to gain: attention. Not a very useful heuristic by itself in practice. Looking at how much incentive they have can be one factor in your estimation, but I'd strongly disagree with "not much more to it". 
If you think it is OK I have a bridge you would totally love to buy!  
> It's amazing how many people mistake their own ignorance for valid skepticism.How could anyone ever truly know the difference though?
See you in week
Why thank you! :D
I'll get u more information...
Ah *HAH!* That's *EXACTLY* what they'd *WANT* you to *BELIEVE* BUT- [hurtles backward down a rabbit hole]Edit [from inside afore mentioned rabbit hole] *or is it a snake hole?! THEY'D JUST WANT YOU TO BELIVE IT WAS A RABBIT HOLE BECAUSE THATS WHEN YOU WOULD LEAST EXPECT IT!*
Eh, there are a lot of variations on it. There isn't a singular form of closure, and often in terms of skepticism and skeptical arguments, the knowledge of p does in fact imply knowledge of q with the knowledge that p -> q. It does happen this way. Though the reasonable forms of it are the ones such as what you suggest, they provide different types of justifications from the form that /u/intuser is talking about.
I didn't know that.
? Seriously? Don't be an asshole
I don't think that's necessarily true. We make matter of fact statements all the time, like "it's sunny out," or "the sky is blue". There aren't incentives involved in these statements. I'll grant that the degree of the incentive certainly matters and I oversimplified on that ground.
I think tracking is a pretty cool concept.
Thank you, I feel the same. And it's not that I'm not educated (masters degree in engineering). I just think that there are so many variables, it's just too difficult to be 100% sure one way or another.     
> > > > > Also, Descartes doesn't assume God, he throws God out as well in Meditations on First Philosophy 1 and 2. I think these are the most valuable ones, because it's only after that that he "proves" God's existence.The problem is that given the position he maneuvers himself into, he *has* to prove God in order to allow for any knowledge at all beyond the Cogito.
I take that as a pleasant form of "fuck you, nobody cares." Which is fair enough. But overall, a reasonable response to global skepticism and pseudo-skepticism is a good message for popular philosophy audiences. Wittgenstein's *On Certainty* would have provided another interesting response to philosophical skepticism.
You could have beliefs, the problem is getting emotionally invested in them. Sometimes really smart people, who are known for their ideas, tend view those ideas as extensions of themselves so when they are attacked, they too feel under siege. 
Wait... how can I trust you? 
Thank you for your reply. You are absolutely correct.Just to spell it out a little bit more. Yes, there are some reasonable ways to fix it. It is a well-known problem, after all. But as postulated in the video, it seems like the weakest form.I'm not trying to straw-man the closure argument, but I do think that in the stronger forms the closure argument doesn't exactly support the video the way he needs. 
>but my fierce philosophical skepticism has led me directly into understanding the importance of faith and mysticismThis is an oxymoron though. To adopt mysticism means to leave behind any shred of skepticism.And to be fair>Much needed corrective to the broader materialist objective epistemology that dominates bourgeois western thoughtThis is a pretty big word salad of a sentence.
>We make matter of fact statements all the time, like "it's sunny out," or "the sky is blue".And I'm not skeptical of them because of reasons such as1) easily verifiable2) I know it's true to begin with3) this doesn't really matter so I don't give a shit**not** because I don't think people don't have an incentive to lie about "matter of fact" things. Little kids lie about random shit all the time because it's a really "cool" fact that gets them to wow their friends. Or people exaggerate how shitty the weather was in their story to make it more interesting. 
Yeah one of the biggest things that made me question it was the taxes they plan on putting in place. Some people may disagree but I've always been one to question and heavily research anything that has a tax associated with it. Why the need for a tax, who's the money going to, who has connections to companies receiving the subsidies, who/what benefits and who doesn't. This tax seems more of a way to get subsidies into select people's companies. I'm all for clean energy but I just don't like the way they're going about creating this change. 
Cool. Thanks for the response.
I'm not convinced that's something that affects only smart people, or that it's something you can purposely control. Nor am I convinced that having people not be attached to ideas wouldn't have some seriously bad side effects, like living lives devoid of meaning, or not taking social obligations seriously, or some such.
I think he is dealing with the fact that to believe anything you have to make some basic assumptions about existence and the way you encounter the physical world. I think in this context it would be said that all people have "faith" but they fail to realize the impact it plays in their lives. 
How do you know all that? What proof is there? 
That's just it, lol, the whole post below was intended to explain that apparent oxymoron. It's not as much an oxymoron as it appears at first. It only is if you continue to insist on knowledge being something that is objectively probable beyond doubt in the dominant occidental pattern. But the whole revelation of skepticism is that this kind of knowledge is impossible and effectively irrelevant. We might then wonder if any form of knowledge is possible. That's where mysticism comes back in. The Indian epistemologists pondered this extensively in ancient times 
Sorry didn't see the "attention" part of your first comment. And right, I suppose that differentiating between peoples' incentives to deceive is the hard part about skepticism. 
You make this sound like your skepticism about climate change has to do with your skepticism about taxes. The taxes do not enter into why the science is correct, unless you think the data is manufactured to justify taxes which would be on the conspiratorial without evidence end of things.
Are you suggesting that I can't know whether I could have built the rocket without knowledge of rocket science?
Well the taxes are based on humans being the leading cause of climate change. I'm skeptical about that, and the fact they want to start taxing for this reason makes me feel uneasy. 
Hence why I called it a critique of Buddhism and noted their diametrically opposed more often than not. Or am I missing something? 
You can't even know the first thing about it. A few examples:1) how do you know what a rocket is2) how do you know your memory of the event is correct3) how do you know there is any physical substrate to build anything out of at alland on and on. It's so extensive it almost doesnt even make sense to try to invent specific examples. It's just basally faulty. 
*Buddhism comes to a lot of the same conclusions psychoanalysis does* (thanks to Jung's fascination with eastern religions) but either from different directions (if we think of politics/culture as a spectrum or  even quadrant) or starts from the same initial phenomena and concludes the opposite way.  Hmm...Maybe I misread the first part of the quote section...If so, my apologies.
That's really a tall order for me as.i am totally unschooled in psychoanalytic theories.
I don't truly know the answers to any of those questions. I could very well be living in a computer simulation and my rocket could actually be bits of computer code.However, I do know that the rocket operates on the laws of physics which are internally consistent in the context of the observable universe. In other words, I might not know whether I'm in a simulation but I do know that said simulation operates according to internally consistent rules if indeed I'm actually living in a simulation.
>  I do know that the rocket operates on the laws of physics which are internally consistent in the context of the observable universeHow? How do you know that? Because you saw it with your eyes? How do you know they work properly? How do you know your mind is consistent enough to maintain a logical thought to completion? What if you are simply delusional or hallucinating?Are you not familiar with the skeptics at all? Sextus Empiricus is a good place to start. 
>Human rights are nothing more than a social construct;You can believe this and still believe that natural rights exist. The two are not mutually exclusive. You can believe there is an "evolutionary" basis to morality but still believe in objective moral truth.
Capitalism. It made it ok for people to take advantage of other people for their own benefit. Other's ignorance shouldn't be exploited, unless they've consented. Bc Violence. In that case, we must then decide if they are competent enough to make a logical decision. If they are not, what then?When will the violence and control stop?
I was just thinking this. Ancaps for example derive ,dare I say, all rights from bodily autonomy.
Sorry, are you actually claiming that human rights are inherent in nature? Because unless you posit the existence of a higher power, I don't understand how you've arrived at that assumption.
Not all laws come out of necessity.
The law, as such, was invented to protect the interests of a limited caste of people. You could say the law evolved to protect human rights, though.
What "proper" rights do you consider to have been objectively derived?
I am afraid there is UN declaration of Human Rights. And that is enforced.
is that good, though? if jay walking were punishable by execution, nobody would jay walk. but it would be a hideous law. and in the abstract that's what all laws are designed to do
> Problem is you can't define morality. Argue for that. Plenty of philosophers disagree.>I wouldn't say human rights are supported by law. That shit is CONTROLLED by law. We're on a slippery slope folks. We already pretty much slaves.  What are you talking about?
Are you talking about the U.S.? Because the majority of citizens support it. The public support of it combined with key victories in various states is what led the supreme Court to hear the case in the first place.Now go look at a country that does not have a majority of their citizens support gay marriage: chances are it isn't legal there. That alone disproves the idea of human rights existing independently of concepts and values of society. If they truly we're independent and existed regardless, then gay marriage would be legal everywhere.
I fucking loved Agamben's *Homo Sacer* and am now skeptical of any human rights discourse.
> Should the law be considered when making judgements about what is or is not moral?No, that reverses the relationship law has with justice: law serves justice, it doesn't determine it.
They have been pretty consistently discussed in most media since their respective living influences.
That's a fantastic question, and I don't have an answer to it. The lazy answer I go with is "a large majority," but I know that's not exactly satisfying in a philosophical sense.
I agree that culture ultimately determines rights, but I'm curious as well if law can shape culture to the extent that norms themselves might change.
Very true, which is why I look at it as a whole. We as a species have agreed on a few things, and it's those things that I think we can think of as rights. 
I was sad looking at this thread until I found you two <3
Consensual relationships. Thats capitalism.Anything else  is not. And any other system lacks consensual relationships
Argue for that.
Ancaps are not anarchists. All they care about is money and how to make more of it.
You have natural given rights at birth. The right to eat, live, drink, and be without violence. Granted, it may be perceived otherwise simply b/c of the overreach of greedy, lustful men to control you, but the bottom line is.... nobody tells the fawn that it cant drink from the river. Nobody tells the bird that there is a no-fly zone. Nobody tells the elephant he goes to jail if he eats something. Nature, by nature (no pun intended) has inherent rights by simply existing, and we are no different than the natural that created us. 
Nope.  Jeremy Bentham was. I just think his response is brilliant.  The notion of rights falls apart as quickly as they are trampled upon.  Tell David Dao about his fourth amendment rights.  Fairy dust.  Or maybe his rights exist if a court decides they do, huh?
Most come from money. 
Isn't that because for the Western context the situation in SA is not, in fact, legally true (by which I mean it would not be legal to deny those rights Saudi deny women over here)? Our perspective that it's a problem correlates with our laws.
The law restricts the right to violence. Law is universally appealing (even thieves want the booty shared fairly.)  It allows voluntary relationships to flourish and markets to form and thrive.  Law and contracts existed prior to the first city-states. Of course, if an elite group has the *social authority* to redefine law it tends to get defined to benefit some over others.  Decentralization might be an approach forward. 
UN is now global?
if any person legally losing a right means it's not a right, then there are no rights. (which I think is true, partially for this reason). there is no right so sacrosanct that the govt won't take it from you in the right circumstances
Actually polls show a 60-40 split in most cases against it.  The Supreme decided to hear it after several states outlawed it....by popular vote..see NE, VA, MS...and dictated to those states that their cultural norms were wrong and they were forced to abide.  Thus the values of those states and the society's that reside there were deemed irrelavant, thus culture has nothing to do with it.  Money ultimatly made the decision.  A vote in the 50 states today would result in no queer marriage.  
I haven't read the book, can you give a specific example of what would make you skeptical and why?  
You're responding to a normative question with a positive statement.
Laws come from what is seen as helping society function. What keeps a society functioning is not always moral, and vice versa.
That's exactly what I think it is. I think the causation the article claims is backwards. I think human nature evolves because of societal progress.the concepts that the Greeks developed about consciousness, thought and the physical world are an integral part of how we think now but at the time these were advanced, abstract theories being taught by the equivalent of proffesors.
This is quite simple from where I'm sitting... There is a very small set of universal desires and we all agree that these should be considered "rights"... everything else is and always will be argued about ad infinitum.
Not true at all. Voluntaryism is the practice of consensual relations.
To me it seems self-evident. Human societies have created moral systems to maintain order and enhance cooperation between members. Can you argue that this in not the case? 
I think it stems from the nature of consciousness and the perception that one is observing reality as if one is separate from it.  That's just a guess, though.  It's easy to feel as though you exist inside yourself and the universe exists outside your body instead of you being a very tiny part of the universe, squished in there with everything else.
>nobody tells the fawn that it cant drink from the riverJust watch some nature document that shows what happens when the source of water are low.>Nobody tells the bird that there is a no-fly zone. Just other birds. They can be quite territorial.>The right to eat, live, drink, and be without violence.Have you ever seen nature outside of ZOO? 
I'm not sure what your point is. Just because I have rights doesn't mean that everybody respects them.
This is just simplistic. If you actually hold views like this, wow.
That's a good question. Given that SA has its laws, whatever falls under its jurisdiction would be considered legally true within that jurisdiction, and the same for US law. So even though it would be illegal under US law, that's irrelevant, because this is a problem for SA law.
Do yourself and us a favour and read up on what law actually is, how it came to be, and whom it actually granted rights early in its history.
Eergh... Yes...?Or you mean than not every nation has pledged to follow UN requirements? True. Like North Korea, for example. That does not do them much good though, as the principles of UN still are enforced in one way or the other, if not directly, then indirectly (via sanctions, for example).> There are no "Human Rights" inside of law, only law.Is just false for the countries which obey UN requirements. 
That would be the difference between right and law. If we take what you said at face value no government would be capable of breaking human rights if they just stated it's not a right anymore. It does not work like that.
So no right to a fair trial?
As a Derrida fan, I'd ask you to consider how separate those two categories are?
What evidence is that?
I didn't say rob (implying use of force or violence to take property).  It said Theft (taking property that does not belong to me, but no violence involved)
Fair enough, but what do you see as being in that set of universal desires?
That's not what is stated at all. Religion is mentioned, but certainly not related to religion at all. 
Have you ever thought for yourself outside of Government provided education?
No no, just being a smartass. But I have seen companies I've been close to use market power and political leverage to shut out competition with anticompetitive laws. I'd rather almost no laws and let the chips fall where they may. Big corporations love regulations, only they can afford them. 
Leave a few toddlers in a room and you can watch it be invented anew. 
Fair points and agreed... maybe slightly begrudgingly 
> If the dictator's troops surrender, they would not kill them.I don't think that works. You could replace that with anything depending on your perspective, "if they did ..., we would not kill them." Their right to live is being broken, the question is whether that is justified.
Where did I say that
To be honest, just reading the replies to my comments, I truly can't wrap my head around the way you folks think. I'm a fairly compassionate person, but for you people to feel compassion for people that don't deserve it truly boggles my mind. It's almost like you all have Stockholm's syndrome. 
That's actually very much the point of Agamben's work, Derrida is a big influence on him.
I can give a small summary but the rest will be published in an paper at some point. So if you are genuinely curious, we can talk a short bit on it otherwise I am not interested in an argument in which you already feel has zero chance of changing your mind.
No. Nothing is so good that all alternatives should be forever precluded. 
Lol are you serious? It comes from the days when people thought the big man in the sky had created everything and the universe ran according to the ticking of his cosmic clock. You take away the Deity and the idea of natural rights no longer has any solid foundation.
Yes and if that big G in government means you have some particular government in mind than with really high probability I was not part of that at all.
Do you even see the irony in that statement?
>  I truly can't wrap my head around the way you folks think.Perhaps this sub isn't a good fit for you.
how is that inherent? how is that even implied?
Then there is the lovely term/definition enemy combatant?
As an undergrad it's heartening to see I'm understanding my coursework!
Well, how separate are any two things we consider binary? 
I was unaware the point of philosophy was to change someone's mind. That's a really narrow way of looking at it.
> The atomic bomb will explode no matter whatIncorrect. It explodes because we make it explode. It exists because we make it exist. 
The bird has the natural right to fly, the cheetah the right to run, the Buffalo to graze freely. These are natural rights. The Spaghetti monster your so adamant to attack, does not. What are you on about? 
Somewhat, but it's based in logic. If you have killed you have shown that you do not value life. Therefore, your life has no value and for someone to take it would mean nothing.
My only statement  is that at a certain point, you've done enough evil to void your "basic human rights"
I wasn't really considering tyranny and freedom binary. I was mainly speaking in light of how most people categorize freedom and tyranny are night and day, but the boundary between the two is very thin. 
Your response almost mimics what I thought as I wrote my post: perspective.  Justice being relative is all about the perspective you take when you look at it and as I wrote it felt like I was going in and out of thinking about justice locally versus nationally or regionally.  As you said, it may be less relative, and I agree.  Somewhere along the construction of justice those individual concepts/principles get molded in with someone else's, and so on making it more applicable to broader folks.  Your point is well taken.  Nice chatting 
Yes, in the case of property it would be the ability to own things as the fundamental human attribute. So the victim of robbery has had force applied and harm done because the things that have were owned are changed involuntarily. 
I think you're confusing abilities with "rights". A right is a moral or legal entitlement that is decided upon by a community or society, i.e. an abstract concept which is not observable in nature and which only exists as a mental construct.If you want to prove that such "rights" inherently exist in nature, then you need to prove that they do so outside of human thought.
Yes. As well as any other rights included in our understanding of human rights.
It would also mean the one who takes that life doesn't value it. 
You don't stop being human when you hurt others, this kind of thinking only mythologizes the worst among us into some sort of monsters. They are not monsters, at least in the literal sense. I know this strips away a sort of reassuring thought that you or other people you perceive as normal would never do horrible things, but that's a delusion. We are all capable of what you call evil. This is why people are shocked their loved one would, say, molested children.
I think he was going further and suggesting that anythings that are binary have no real boundary. Though i may be putting words in mouths.
I don't remember where I read it but someone suggested (as a thought experiment) that the best law would be the one written by a group of people with artificially induced temporary amnesia of their own circumstances (technology we lack of course), forcing them to consider all perspectives equally since they never know which role they would play once they get back to their lives in society.
That's a bit of a stretch. I'm just trying to understand how you folks have such strong sympathy for evil. You must have never seen it in person. 
I'm fully aware that every human is capable of being a monster given the right circumstances, you're very right, I've seen this first hand. However when a person isn't fighting for their life, or their survival in an austere environment, and just plain enjoys hurting others, they're not human. I'm sorry, no matter how you try to swing that, some people are not fixable, and are animals, and need to be dealt with accordingly.
That doesn't really make any sense. There are many very well-defined binary things in the universe, and definitely in the world of mathematics. An example is electrical charge; there is no doubt about whether a particle has positive or negative charge, and no in-between.However, most things we deal with are complex combinations of many things (either concepts of physical things) so one quickly enters the realm of statistical realities and fuzzy set theory.
It's recorded by Herodotus that the ancient Persians would debate their decisions twice- once while drunk and once while sober..... I'd say they were trying their best. Personally I'd like a system where people on psychedelics are making the decisions; but that's just based on some personal experiences
I believe you are applying what is generally known as a loaded question, popularly known as the "have you stopped beating your wife yet?"-question.
> I'm sorry, no matter how you try to swing that, some people are not fixable, and are animals, and need to be dealt with accordinglyIronically, it's people with this thought process who best fit your description.
>Pascal laid the groundwork for probability theory, also known as game theory. ~~If you're going to criticize and argue against a claim, the prerequisite is getting the claim right.~~If I'm going to respond to someones criticism, I have to understand the criticism and what was said to warrant it.I thought OP said that probability theory led the groundwork for game theory, but I goofed and realized OP really did say they were the same thing... d'oh. 
Much better than I was going to express it.  The benefit of enjoying a heathen's life, should there be no benefit in the [possible] afterlife, thereby becomes of infinitesimal value.It all really come down to making an all-or-nothing decision and living with the consequences.  Or just repent on your deathbed.
I would agree that the biggest flaw with the God example is that in a situation where it matters the logic being used undermines the entire point of following a religion.
You are literally arguing against what he called the "flawed wager." What point are you exactly trying to make?
I really don't think OP does. IMO, all the qualifications that he states, his gotchas, are implied in the "false wager." When people say, believing in God is worth the reward despite the fact it might not pay out, they mean specifically their concept of god. That's pretty much universally understood.
Plus in some games like poker you play against other players, not the house.  They get a "rake", basically a tiny cut of the pot, and that's how they make their money on those.
> If the reason for the wager is to take the question of God's existence seriously, that would be a de facto argument as to why one should believe in God.It'd be an argument in favor of belief in God, but not necessarily one that can be compelling on its own.
Belief is not the same as counterevidential faith.
The utility of resources falls off as you get more of them.  $1001 is not as good compared to $1000 as $1 is to $0.
Actually, if we have no information about God at all, then any of his possible demands has an equal probability of being real. They all cancel out, since !D is possible for every D. He could either say "don't eat fish" or "do eat fish," and so on; for every possible demand obeyed, there is an equal and opposite demand *dis*obeyed. Therefore, Pascal's Wager tells us nothing.
Well. That invokes the concept of *conscious decision,* which is a Hard Problem.
They could *surround* themselves with propaganda, but they cannot *directly* change their beliefs.
I can imagine the most perfect possible argument for God. But the most perfect possible argument would be *real,* since a real argument is better than an imaginary one.:P
As a response to Pascal's Wager, I've always liked "well, I've never told you this before, but the truth is that I'm the guy that decides who goes to Heaven and who goes to Hell. Give me $20 and I can guarantee you a place in Heaven. $20 for a potentially infinite reward, that's worth the risk right?"
I think I've heard this from a friend or in a class once. I find these other thought experiments which apply the same concepts to absurd situations to be really amusing, because it shows how unreasonable some philosophical concepts are, and how misleading certain thought experiments can be.
I've been bamboozled. Have my upvote.
>Why it's still bandied about boggles my mind.At a guess, a mix of A) being _told_ it's a solid argument without exposure to criticism thereof and B) classic confirmation bias leading to overlooking the flaws.
Hungry for apples?
>But you don't have to spend finite time, you can rape and kill and steal your entire life and repent last second. That's just less of your finite time, still finite
Why should I care about Fermat (coming from ignorance but willing to learn)?
I think they might be trying to say that there are an infinite amount of conceivable gods, and so the chance of you "picking correctly" is next to nothing. 
&infin; is merely a variable representing a number that is infinitely large. How they behave when taken to the limit of infinity determines how functions of them behave.L'Hopital can explain it better than I can.This one converges to 0. You're not getting your wager back.
Atheists wager nothing.
If you're into it for clubbiness, then fine. Nothing wrong with playing dress-up and make-believe. Check out any Comicon.But if you start claiming that you're going to reap infinite rewards and everyone not in your religion isn't, then you're on the wrong side of the math.And when your religion has made itself the goverment, that's a far more serious problem.
You're assuming there's one god who's messing with people. That's just one of the infinitude, because most of those other people think you're wrong, and their god has told them so.That last thing you said is the fallacy of appeal to popularity, and does not enter the math, here.
Well, yeah. Pascal just didn't want to admit that he was capable of higher math but incapable of distancing himself from populist peer pressure.
Good thing my religion doesn't require me to check my brain at the door, believe contradictory things, or agree with things I disagree with, no matter how many times unbelievers claim that it does.(I believe in the Logos, the infinite mind of God, who rejoices in thinkers actively discovering truth and wisdom wherever it may be found, and who reveals the truths of God which cannot be found in this material universe. He is glad that you're enjoying the brain He provided.)
I'd highly recommend to check out My Night at Maud's aswell if you have some kind of interest.
I'm simply pointing out an additional reason the believer's position is "unsafe".  So I'm in agreement that the wager is flawed, just adding a point that I didn't see in his statements.So... changing something in my statement.
>If I knew Dairy Queen was handing out free ice cream cones, and I told you because I saw that you didn't have one, would you think that's because I hate you?More like: if you moved into a neighborhood and saw a local about to bite into a burger from the local burger shop, you proceeded to run over, knock it out of his hands, and offer him in coupons for veggie burgers redeemable in the afterlife--and maybe also razed the previous burger shop to the ground and threatened to torture and execute anyone who didn't declare your veggie burger coupons the real burger experience. 
Because I'm not an atheist, even though I understand that it is my responsibility to myself and others and any gods that may exist to act like it, and as a hopeful believer in a world where my responsibilities are to act as an atheist, it requires a degree of stubbornness and resolve against my predilection to believe, implied by the word 'vehement', to accomplish that.
Sure.  I'm assuming you mean that it would be some evidence toward it; not conclusive evidence.
And it's god. Anything is possible. Could be a possum named Chuck for all we know.
Lol, it's not $20! It's 10% of your gross wage! (Tithe for a catholic)
Sure, but have you considered that God may exist and has no interest in your belief or devotion, but in your character and actions?
Yes, I must have missed that point. Thanks
Betting on religions is like betting on a horse race where the race started before you arrived, the horses are nowhere to be found, the announcers make up the events as they please, even inventing new participants, and a victor won't be called for the entirety of the foreseeable future.
>If you bet even *one* of your chips on black at the roulette table, but....the roulette table has been closed down for decades, and everyone is playing blackjack, then you lose.Not really. If it's closed down no one is taking that chip so all you need to do is pick it back up on go on your way. What you're looking at is a quarter slot machine (or any vending machine) that isn't plugged in but it takes your quarter anyway and you can't get it back. 
There are lots of things that aren't quite untestable, but that can only be tested once, like "what's the chance I will die tomorrow?"As for actually untestable, you can consider the state of objects that are far enough away from us in the universe so that their light will never reach us, which, to the best of my knowledge, physicists believe exist.
But the initial viewpoint was also based on no evidence, so the actions are somewhat consistent.1. Mainstream church leader says X is true.2. Person believes X to be true.3. Mormon church leader and boyfriend says Y is true.4. Person believes Y to be true.
I've never lost any money at craps.I've never played craps.I'm probably above average in gross profit from craps. 
Now you're weighing the truth-claims of one sect vs another, taking the question seriously per OP, and answering it according to your morality, weighing what type of a god you believe would be just.
So now we're back to 1) taking the matter seriously, not flippantly, and 2) weighing evidentiary claims instead of weighing hypothetical metaphysical scenarios.  Which religions make truth-claims which can be tested and possibly proven false?
I don't believe such a god exists.
Because it's a culturally accepted characteristic of gods, explored in poor theological thinking, fantasy fiction, role-playing games, and atheists' ideas about religion.Ask the believer of a religion what their God requires, and what their God merely wants, and you'll rarely hear "worship is necessary, or else."
Guaranteed limbo over possibilities of eternal Heaven or Hell? I agree, I might very well make the conscious choice not to believe in gods rather than risk it.(Furthermore, I heard that there are no non-human animals in Abraham's Heaven. Screw that place.)
What's converging here? You can't speak of limits of just anything; you need a function of some kind.
I never mentioned infinitesimal risks - quite the opposite - I spoke of guarantees. Or put another way: 'infinite risks'.
That's humorously similar to the way I think of him.
I am a merciful god.
98% is a bit high
yeah, but if "but I don't believe that" is an acceptable counterargument, then Pascal's Wager clearly doesn't work.
What if god exists, but heaven and hell do not exist?
Only the flaw is there is a cult of people telling you that roulette is the only way to not get thrown out, and the croupier isn't there to confirm or deny the game is or isn't open. 
The problem is that it's a message being misrepresented in that case, not a metaphor/analogy/moral. I mean choosing to interpret certain parts of religious text a way that is not even being expressed is just doubling down on not using critical thinking in any capacity.
Speaking of game theory... There *should* be no shame in getting things wrong, but people can gain social power or "face" by pointing out errors, and those who make errors often lose face, so from a game theory POV it often makes sense to conceal errors or deny that an error is as big as it seems. In special circumstances, such as this one, acknowledging an error can actually be beneficial, but that's often not the case. Fundamentally, the credibility of a person is based in part on consistent correctness, and anything that disrupts that consistency is a threat to their credibility. 
> As for actually untestable, you can consider the state of objects that are far enough away from us in the universe so that their light will never reach us, which, to the best of my knowledge, physicists believe exist.In this instance, aren't you just referring to a 0 probability as untestable?
The misattributed Marcus Aurelius quote touched on this. You ought not to worship an unjust god. _Rebel_, fight back, or suffer. Either way you lived a more virtuous life than that of one who submits to that unjust god.It should not be taken as claim of disproof. Its an acknowledgement of resistance in this one outcome.
In that scenario, I don't really wanna be judged by a being.  Why should the ultimate evil seek to please such a being?
You're well above the average for people who've played. The amount spent annually on replacing worn felt alone is strong evidence of that.
I said, "in that case". This is referring to the branch of the decision tree where the outcome for atheism is also tied to an infinity reward. I make no judgement on the truth claim of that sect. Just that if you are trying to make a complete decision tree, that is a valid possibility and not a logical paradox. I make no claim on the probability of it being the outcome.
Well, Pascals wager says that you should consider it. 
> (Furthermore, I heard that there are no non-human animals in Abraham's Heaven. Screw that place.)My wife stopped believing in heaven/god when she was a 9-10 year old and her devout Mother told her that there were no animals in heaven, nor were they allowed.
Okay. Call it *v = rxy,* where *v* is the value, *r* is the payout, *x* is the probability there are any gods, and *y* is the probability you've picked the right one given any exists. In this form it takes the form of &infin;\*0\*0 instead of &infin;/&infin;^2 but it's the same thing.
It's fun to tell Christians that tithing is a strictly Old Testament thing. Christian writings never talk about giving 10% to the church.
Better not take that chance, best to just believe everything. What do you have to lose?
Or maybe there is a God, but he will punish you for believing him or for doing good, and reward those who don't believe in him or those who do evil.
Make sure to minimize your management fees by avoiding religions with tithing requirements!
Uh, I think just taking something at face-value is "not using critical thinking in any capacity."
Slow down!
I granted the matter of epistemic difficulty while pointing it out as basically irrelevant. I'm not sure who you think claims an epistemic merit of confirmation bias, but I do know that while humans succumb to it, at times, ideal beings never do.
And it's the one thing I, a devoted Christian, agree with Satan on.  Where we differ is his claim that Yahweh is a manipulative liar, and mine that He is a loving Father.
But suppose the most fulfilled state of being man can attain is to be in awestruck worship of God, would God then not be benevolent for requiring that? I commend your commitment to truth and goodness (to give your eternal life for it!), but consider the possibility of your understanding of truth and goodness being limited or distorted. It would be tragic to choose damnation on a mistake.
Arguments involve giving reasons.
That mother has some 'splainin' to do:>"But whoever causes the downfall of one of these little ones who believe in Me--it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea!" - Jesus
Yep, but it's marginally simpler with N^2 than rational numbers.
Am pastor, can confirm. Tithing is not a NT concept (although Jesus has plenty to say about money/greed/charity) and even the OT model of tithing is very different from the "give 10% of your gross to the church" you almost always hear. Frankly, I don't know how we got here from there.
Believe all the things. 
I refer to my reply, lines three , four and five.3, 4, 5 respectively
I'm pretty sure German Catholics have to give about 9% of the wage. In fact I believe it is automatically deducted. (Kirchensteuer, I believe it is called).Tithe literally means "tenth part" it is derived from two old English words, though I don't remember how to spell them.
Even the things the people say aren't true. Can't trust anyone, maybe they don't want us to believe! 
You do not have a reply in this thread that has five lines.
IIRC it's about 9% of the income tax, not 9% of income - so very well earning Catholics would pay around 4.05% (45% * 9%) of their income to the church - most people less than that however.
Waves white flag, hoping she don't come off as an asshole just because she sees it right above ur comment
Do you mean this?> Okay now I must argue my position per the rules of this thread. Don't do asshole things and the universe will not be a an asshole to you. That's how I perceive don't b an asshole. Thank you for your time spent reading my contemplation of not being an asshole If so, then there are no reasons. * Claim: Don't do asshole things and the universe will not be a an asshole to you.* Reasons for believing this is true: ?
Yes, thank you. The entire article is based on a complete misunderstanding of quantum physics
*Maimed by machine and no longer able to participate in lottery*
The theory only works if you assume that the quantum changes save you in the alternate universe. If you don't start with that assumption obviously it is highly unlikely to occur. The point of thought experiments is to assume a theory as valid and to extrapolate scenarios based on that assumption. 
This also implies theres a universe with no memes
It doesn't matter, as you and your counterpart are exactly the same person up until that point. The universe splits AT the point you die, so up until that exact moment you essentially have no counterpart (in this particular "universe-line/time-line"). When the universe splits, THEN one of you dies and the other lives. But as you were exactly the same person in terms of memory and thoughts etc up to this point, and as you cannot be "aware" of the universe in which you die *following* death, as far as you're concerned you're always the one who survived. 
Yes. Which is true unless you don't consider your consciousness being the same consciousness as 1 second ago. 
Yes, I would say we have. You could also apply it to our existence on Earth. It's just the right distance from the sun, life was able to evolve/be seeded/whatever, and we haven't been gamma-ray-bursted. By mass alone, odds indicate we should be a big cloud of Hydrogen.
Or is this a prediction based on theoretical knowledge about the inner workings of physical phenomena within the framework of quantum mechanics? As in, everything we know about the behavior of particles indicates that they occupy such multifarious positions or states, yet we cannot "catch" them in the act or otherwise document that they do so?Yes. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle also states that we can only guess at either the speed or location of the particle, but not both. Hope this helps a bit. If you are so inclined lookup Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for a better definition. 
It should be noted that the authors understanding of quantum physics seems to be shaky at best
I don't think it would be reasonable to assume that everything will just end. After all - the universe had to come from somewhere. Also, I wouldn't trust the predictive power of modern science on those time scales, as we still don't quite have nailed down what things like dark matter and energy are. Looking at dark energy specifically, it only came into play (overtaking gravity) in the last few billion years. Who knows what other factors may emerge?
But we know enough about thought experiments to do so.
Nothing in science explains why the universe exists in the first place. The scientific conclusion could be that nothing exists at all, so everything else that doesn't exist is just as real.
How? I've always felt it is a simpler explanation
I suppose that since you still have to live with the consequences of your action the same social incentives would be in place as in a non MWI world. That is unless you kill yourself.
The difference is that I'm privileged to my own consciousness while my assistant isn't. I wouldn't call that paradoxical but it is surely not a practical experiment...
Yes! I believe this is an important piece of many-worlds that makes it much more elegant.
There are plenty of writers without a scientific mindset who aren't populistic hacks, lets not insult them.
I think it's called affirmations. The fact that "quantum" even comes into the question is bogus.
So basically your consciousnesses are all connected but you only see through one? If someone could elaborate on this I'd be interested to know how correct (if at all) this is.
I read "Ketamine: Dreams and Reality" by Karl Jansen two years ago and it really explored the various uses of K and how it affects the mind and body. It was a fascinating read and very entertaining if that's something you're into- your comment reminded me of it.
Consciousness never leaps. You have missed the essence of the theory. In fact, according to many world's your consciousness simultaneously exists in an essentially infinite number of realities.
> I'm not exactly sure what's "elegant" about the idea that every quantum interaction in the entire Universe diverges into n parallel UniversesIf you "shut up and calculate", it is simpler. The universe doesn't really care what theory humans like better. And the whole copenhagen collapses add nothing to the math or the experiments and are only there to make human minds more comfortable, because we can't handle infinitely many universes.
Sorry we are only looking for physicists here. /sBut really please go on.
*cashes insurance check*
If you assume the machine perfect (arguments sake)The point is that you will consciously know if you win. You will never consciously know if you lose. The conscious part is what makes the argument true. 
> The point of thought experiments is to assume a theory as valid and to extrapolate scenarios based on that assumption.And when it results in something absurd and obviously false such as "quantum immortality" it's time to go back to the drawing board.
Fortunately, memes are an inter-dimensional constant.
You're assuming a normal distribution of universes (in the sense of a "normal number"). It's entirely possible for there to be an infinite number of universes, all of which you get hit by a bus and die.
Wikipedia is not a factual website, decoherence is not MWI (it's a theory that some people incorporate into MWI but can also be incorporated into a Copenhagen-like theory), and decoherence also does not cause "wave function collapse" or explain the measurement problem. At best, decoherence theory explains why we never measure actual quantum waves, though the quantum equations are wave equations.
There is no single point of time that you die at. It takes time for the bullet to pass through your brain.
But like "1s-ago-me" resides in the same universe as "now-me." Wouldn't those alternate "you"s be inaccessible to my consciousness? So if I died, they would live, but my consciousness would be destroyed?
While that may be so, at this exact moment in time my chance of being in any one universe is equal to my chance of being in any of the other. So why do I happen to be in a universe where the normal curve exists and coin flips follow the expected pattern? 
"FINALLY!" -The universe on the sixth day
Don't forget too, we're not only in an endless ocean of space, but also an endless ocean of time. It doesn't have to be NOW.  It could be any time. If it were a hundred years ago you would exist. If it were a hundred years from now you wouldn't exist. What are the unbelievably slim odds of it being RIGHT NOW, during a time when you happen to exist? 
Yeah true, our current understanding of thermodynamics and conservation of matter/energy could simply be incomplete for the time being. Similarly, if either time travel to the distant past or hopping over to a universe with less entropy turned out to be possible then those would also be possible resolutions.
Not exactly. What's the difference between flipping a coin and killing myself if it comes up heads, and measuring a particle and killing myself if it's measured as "up?" A coin that is sitting heads up is marginally different from one sitting tails up, but whether the coin I'm flipping becomes one or the other is really up to chance... Can the same be said about a particle before it's been measured?
It seems far more complex and a violation of Occam's razor. We can't explore these other worlds. It seems more like a phycological idea than philosophy in my opinion. I have no intuitions that suggest every decision I cross is actualized and played out, creating another world. It seems counterintuitive to think every option is lived out in other worlds. I agree MWI would explain certain observation, however it isn't a necessary explanation just a sufficient one. 
Technically, aren't wave function collapse and uncertainty related because without uncertainty, there would be no wave function to collapse in the first place? 
Double slit experiment. If you don't put a measuring device in front of the double slits (detecting which slit the particle went through), it acts as a wave function. If you do, they behave like classical particles and produce no interference pattern. Noone actually even watches the said measuring device.
YOU are just getting some information about the interaction via some other means anyways.  The "observation" or "interaction" happens with or without a person there to see it. If a wavelength collapses in the forest and noone is there to consciously observe it, it will still have discrete values. Correct me if I missed anything, but "learning" about it isn't the "observation".
> Elitzur-Vaidman bomb Wow, I hadn't seen that one before.  That experiment is almost as much fun as back-wards causation quantum erasure!The photon still interacts with the experiment though.  It's just possible the bomb effects the state of the photon as it hits the detector without the photon passing through the bomb.  (I had to rephrase that last sentence about 20 times in my head, still not 100% sure it's accurate.)
I never said direct interaction.
?? This is not the mainstream opinion. Most neuro people I talk to say it is something we do not understand and probably don't have defined well enough to investigate very well. 
The idea is that the universe sits every time there is a possibility of two or more things happening at a quantum level. It has nothing to do with it revolving around you. The universe(s) where you survive are just some of billions and billions created in the last nanosecond. You only experience the ones where you are not dead so as far as you are concerned the others can be ignored. 
Did you read the article? We're talking about a thought experiment based on the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
I think it's easier to think of it as your consciousness continuing into only the universe where you survive instead of into two separate universes if for example the gun was supposed to go off, but had a bad bullet and didn't. You can't experience not being conscious because not being conscious is the absence of experience, so it would just feel like the gun never goes off. In reality you probably don't always die instantly, so one of you would actually experience getting shot. 
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. But what I took away from the article is that essentially every choice, action, and reaction would have multiple universes extending out from it. In one of them you were born and immediately after that there are nearly an infinite amount of you from all the universes being created based on choices from the one you were born in. (also there would be many universes in which your mother aborted you, or you were still born.)

The sub is a load of bollocks. The first method is to sit in front of a mirror at night. "Everyone knows that mirrors reflect light. But are they also portals to other dimensions?" Answer: no.
Looks like I have a book to read! Thank you for the suggestion.
But can only perceive one? Then what's the point of existing in any others if you can't know you're there and therefore don't have any effect over it?  Your other selves are there doing things there, making choices you might never make because they aren't really you anymore, they made different choices and are therefore different people.Isn't the suggestion that conciousness, i.e. awareness of events and therefore the ability to alter quantum states, chooses the path, versus not choosing the path?  Isn't that the question? 
> If you "shut up and calculate", it is simpler. The universe doesn't really care what theory humans like better.this is a horrendously bad reason to accept anything. "don't question, just accept" ... has formed the basis of no major theory ever.
I'm no philosopher so I'd love to hear your side of it. From a scientific perspective (my perspective) I don't see  how this is the case. A system state collapses from a superposition into an exact state which has direct relation to what you're measuring. This is not something that has to do with consciousness, only mathematics and experimental observation. How does consciousness come into the picture? I'm not trying to be inflammatory I'm genuinely curious.
Same thing 
nawh, shane carruth
As far as science is concerned, consciousness is just your brain's activity.  When the universe splits, both brains are exactly identical.  The "you" in the survivor's universe would be indistinguishable from the "you" right now and would fully believe that it is the "true you" just as you do now.Your consciousness is neither split nor moved; It is duplicated.  Each version of you is exactly as real with exactly the same history as the other.  "You" will survive because there are now two of you and one is a survivor.
What evidence do you have that this theory is "obviously false"? Is your only argument against it that it "sounds absurd"?
Except those changes get amplified over time. The fact that we're talking about this stuff is a result of tiny quantum randomness happening, or we wouldn't have a topic to talk about.That said, you're incorrect. Without the quantum randomness, the sun wouldn't shine, and you would weigh a fraction of what you weigh now, and nothing would have any mass, and electrons would all fall into the protons and turn into energy.
Fortunately?
In the same vein, just because there are infinite universes, that does not mean that there is definitely a universe in which you are a billionaire/immortal/famous or something along those lines. e.x. there are infinite numbers between 1 and 2, but 3 is never one of those numbers.
Nope, there's ours, plus all the ones we've simulated.Given, the ones we've simulated so far are much simpler, smaller, and shorter lived than our own, and it may or may not ever be possible for us to simulate another universe at the same complexity and scale of our own, but that doesn't mean anything.  If we are a simulation, who's to say that our universe isn't simple, small, crude, and short-lived compared to the one hosting our simulation?
It's all the same universe.There are just a whole 3d subset at each instant, or, in the MWT there are several whole 3d subsets at each instant. The thing is, having more than one whole 3d instance at each instant is not more different than having a whole instance at each instance. If you can relate your consciousness in this instant whith the consciousness you had in the previous instant, all current instances should be able to do the same.
The fact that everything looks normal to you is not surprising. Only one of your quintillion selves sees the coin always land heads. And the next day, even fewer will as that one splits into a quintillion possibilities, only one seeing heads each time. There's one more thing this means - one of your multiverse selves has seen the coin land heads their whole life right up until they tried to show someone. Then it stopped landing heads every time. That's got to be embarrassing. 
What progress? I think QM has many philosophical questions that experiments can't answer. 
This is not entirely true. Performing the double slit experiment with a screen to detect the particles will still create an interference pattern. Each single photon/electron will only create a single 'blip' on the screen but if you shoot more and more individual particles through (separately, one at a time) their gradual build-up of 'blips' on the screen will create an interference pattern.
Yea, but I'm just arguing that, from a solipsistic view - because you are alone in your consciousness - nothing else matters until it enters your experience. I'm not trying to argue for this position, but just trying to explain it as a valid argument.Taken to the extreme, from this argument you could essentially say that any object/item/gadget's makeup/build/construction only comes to existence once you try to understand it - it didn't exist before you became interested in it's creation, but the details are now materializing as you try to understand it. 
> The universe isn't something that collapses, and neither do cats.It seems you've reached the pinnacle of ignorance.
I am aware it is solipsism - I was just making the argument that, assuming solipsism is correct, then indeed the "observation" by consciousness (only yours) would collapse the function. This doesn't mean I support the idea.The argument is still valid based on the premises of the assumptions made!
LOL my bad man, wasn't trying to be a smartass or anything, I've just always heard it explained as either outcome A or B but never anything about whether possibilities for C, D, E, F, G, etc. would also exist
AKA The big bang, which occurs everywhere all the time.
You dying isn't a quantum event, though. That's my point. Quantum events have nothing to do with humans. If the universe were to split in such a way as to create two different outcomes of the same event, it's *very* likely that the scale of the event would be so small that there's no hope of ever creating two outcomes of an event involving a complex system, such as a human body.Schroedinger's Cat is just an analogy. The quantum universe working in a way that can keep the cat both alive and dead at the same time is not at all consistent with our observations of quantum events.
That whole idea is based on the premise that you can't trust your senses or any information derived from your senses. If that's the case, the whole idea of a physical universe is moot because the only ways we know anything about the physical universe are by observing it. :)
How would this coincide with material determinism? Or could it? Would all things be determined at random based on the resulting position of particles, still leading to many universes but not allowing room for free will? What sparked the question is the thought of a baby making choices. I don't know much about the thought capacity of a baby but my guess is they are exhibiting basic responses to stimuli more than choosing between options - but then again that's basically the determinist argument for anyone, just more advanced responses and stimuli.
It makes me wonder if dreams are us living through other subconscious "me" living and experiencing bits and pieces of their lives. Which is why things are eerily the same, but different and time skipped in dreams.Those last questions of yours got me fucked up though...I can't even comprehend it
Who said something about accepting anything? Of course the theory has to match reality and should maybe be as simple as possible. Ockams Razor and so on.As I said there is currently no way to experimentally differentiate between the Copenhagen interpretation and the mwi, so what you believe depends on which theory you prefer and which you think is simpler and more elegant. Note believing in something just because you don't like the outcome is also bad.
I don't speak for all of of philosophy, but I think the point is that mathematics and experimental observation literally do not exist except as facets of consciousness.
You are the most correct. 
Charlie Kaufman
Most people see consciousness like a independent soul. They can't understand the concept of duplication of consciousness:If we duplicate your consciousness **both** will be **your** consciousness. 
I've never met or heard of an immortal human. Are you telling me that every human eventually finds themselves in a reality where everyone else is dead? If I live to be 120 years old I will be guaranteed to survive an apocalypse that kills everyone but me?
The quantum suicide experiment has nothing to do with consciousness causing the collaspse.  Indeed, it's a thought experiment about MWI, which is a theory which states no collapse actually occurs.
>more coherentAs opposed to what and by what standard?
The question what the wavefunction represents is quite a hot topic in foundational research at the moment and there has been some good progress on it.
In the videos linked in my comment, Professor Adams says it is in fact the measuring light particle that is just enough to scatter the incoming measured particle and cause wave function collapse. Where did you get your information? 
You can observe data without watching the measuring device. If we go to the extremes, if you believe the human eye has magic superpowers that affect particles, you could put an arduino to register the results and speak to humans with a voice synthesizer so they don't have to look at it. Although basically this already happens, the whole double slit expirement is done by a device that spits some numbers onto a computer screen.
No, I mean that solipsism won't matter. Quantum experiments to prove the existence of a particle's superposition don't stop working because you aren't aware of them.Maybe the world is undetermined until you are aware of it, but that non-determinism is not quantum or based on quantum effects. 
Possibilities a,b,c,d,e,f,g....on to infinity basically, would exist, but from the perspective of *probability* version A (dead) and B (alive) would be the most likely. However, like you figured, anything is possible, a meteor could come crashing through the roof and strike the bullet in mid air, but probabilistically that option would make up a very small portion of the "infinite" possibilities. 
No me dying is a result of many quantum events, in another universe there was a set of many quantum events that did not result in my dying, those are the ones I experience. 
Its not only the babies choices though. Every action taken by anyone anywhere would result in an infinite amount of off shoots. And since those actions would/could have an impact on the life of the baby there would now be more than one universe the baby exists in.
I'd say it's unlikely since dreams are often just a manifestation of our most pressing concerns/thoughts. But it's always fun to think about it that way -- to think that some version of you continually decides to jump off a cliff or is being chased by lagoon monsters!
I'm telling you it's possible.
Another particle with a wavefunction or a whole system of them. Consciousness is no part of it.
More coherent than other quantum interpretations, by physics standards.
Not op, but any BSc level college book should do. For my QM1 class we used 'introduction to quantum mechanics' by Griffiths. It's a first year course and the book doesn't require a lot of college level physics knowledge. If you're up to speed on the math, you should be able to work through it. 
Ultimately it's not about the human eye having magic effects, but rather that the entirety of our capacity to engage in scientific enquiry is contained within the set of the activities of perception and consideration.A lens doesn't have magic effects on the source of light, but we have to always consider what effects that lens has on the observation and analysis of that source. 
I think there is a misunderstanding here, I don't think the above comments are making a claim that there needs to be other actual human observers vs machines/film. It has more to do with the results only mattering/collapsing when you become aware of them.
"Possibilities a,b,c,d,e,f,g....on to infinity basically, would exist, but from the perspective of probability version A (dead) and B (alive) would be the most likely"Okay, so if I'm getting this (which I might not be), possibilities ARE infinite, but would technically exist as sort of branches from version A and version B?  
That doesn't make any sense. For every universe in which you die as the result of a gunshot wound to the head, there would be a near-infinite number of universes in which you don't die from that same gunshot wound. By your thinking, which one of those universes do you experience?
Isn't this a quote by Socrates in the Euthyphro?
Kinda sorta. Mindfulness is one of many *techniques* whereas the *theory* could be loosely described as the "law of attraction."
Conversely, though, activities of conscious observation likely must necessarily always fall into the set of activities which are interactions. So it's not merely conscious observation that collapses it, but conscious observation always will, and we can't observe it not doing so.
Yes, exactly.  Surviving the gunshot but being comatose is just a branched option of "Live", where the gun jamming but a meteor striking Earth and wiping out all life is a branched option of "Die".Every scenario with more than 2 outcomes can be further broken down into multiple scenarios with only 2 outcomes.
Why doesn't it make sense? You would only experience the universes which are characterized, by definition, by the possibility of experience. If the universe splits for every quantum event, then you can only experience universes where your consciousness continues to exist. Of course, for the case of the thought experiment, the "gun" is considered to either kill you or not go off. So it excludes situations where you're alive, but horribly maimed or paralyzed. By I don't see why this would contradict the general principle that the though experiment is meant to explore. 
Something that won't work unless I expect it to work? It doesn't sound very scientific. It's on par with prayer and luck and other superstitious nonsense.
It's not possible for any interaction of matter to occur which doesn't collapse some of the particles' possible states.  My point was that "consciousness" has no bearing on the enactment or result of an interaction.
Because the entanglement caused by interacting with the screen involves many more particles than the entanglement caused by not interacting along the way. Therefore, the range of possible consistent results is much smaller when you ask about 100,000 particles than when you ask about 2 or 3.  At least, I think that's what I read is the current consensus such as it is.
Yes that's it exactly. Although limitations of how we measure things do come into account, the uncertainty is "baked" into quantum particles. It is a feature that results from their probabilistic nature.
Do you assume that each particle actually has a definite position and momentum, leaving aside our ability to know what either value is?If so, it seems to me that the probabilities are epistemic in nature.
We use Sparkol's VideoScribe! Great program :)
Eh, it's pretty smug and people misuse it a lot.
At this point, it's useless to try and have a discussion with people because there's always a fallacy they bring up to try and discredit you. It got old fast. 
How hard is AP Lang? Should I take it next year(Sorry if this is off topic or came out of the blue lol)
umustbesmart
Fair question. Is it ethical to believe in logic? Leap of Faith? Critique of Instrumental Reason? etc. 
That's  another fallacy :P 
Thank you! I will look into it. Your videos are great!
How is it smug? I know it is misused, but I don't think that can be helped. I know the creator and will happily pass on any useful feedback as to how it can be improved. The world needs this stuff, we're open to suggestions. 
Are there any phallic fallacies to consider? 
I asked a professor of logic this once and all she said was "because it seems right."
I suppose its usage is usually too smug, not that the site is smug per se.  The format makes it very easy to be used as such.
It insists upon itself, it's self consistent, and it seems to give good results. 
True - like the "what have you tried?" coding advice. 
Agreed. I could link to the fallacy fallacy page, but I don't want to appear facetious 
That wouldn't work. Cause now you arguing out of context
Anyone could say that about anything they believe in, though id probably disagree. But then again I'd be using logic to come to the conclusion of disagreeing. Yeah, why do we believe in logic?
In the original comment you claimed that it wasn't important. Either way, I still don't understand the argument. Seems like it's mostly just "some philosophers have said that the world could be different than what it is, therefore we should just abandon logic completely". All modern philosophy is based upon logic, that is an unarguable fact
Depends on the situation really. Truth don't matter in most cases where you have an audience.
I meant you're probably not using the terms the way other people *here* are probably using them, because it's a philosophy sub and your usage is somewhat at odds with the prevailing concerns within philosophy. So, at worst, it matters here.
I run a half marathon nearly every weekend. Now I have something to listen to when I don't feel like Dan Carlins hardcore history!
PEL, VBW, Philosophize This, and HoP are all good. The first two are conversational, the second two are scripted. Different animals."In Our Time," "Philosophy Bites," "Philosopher's Zone," and "Elucidations" are also good, but they're mostly scholars talking about their own work or weighing in as experts. That's great, but there's also value in vicariously participating in a conversation among fellow learners, which is really a novel way of learning that podcasting has opened up to us.
You have any recommendations on an entry episode to get me interested?
"I mean I get what he's saying, but this is basically the categorical imperative." - Wes
Camus is my favorite existentialist, though... /s
The Tractatus episode is not the place to start... very very difficult text. Plus, the audio on that is about the worst we've had. 
PocketCast user here. It shows all 164 episodes.
Insulting how? Ha
Uh, no. The name itself is making a philosophical point about the impossibility (and undesirability) of full, constant examination. Early episodes were concerned in part with how weird (unhealthy?) it is to actually do philosophy as a profession.
My hats off to you. Anything more challenging than a phish concert when I run just tires me out. 
That's the problem of a philosophy podcast against most other stuff. Even the light stuff requires putting a lot of attention we internet addict millennials aren't ready to 
History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps can be pretty dry at times but is really good if you want a chronological look at philosophy and the evolution of thought.
Agreed. Some of the PEL is pretty advanced and hard to grasp. If you are starting out in philosophy, it can be difficult 
Early stuff took them a while to get in the groove so I wouldn't start with the first episode. I would check out the episode descriptions for something you are interested in.Typically I like episodes with guests so check out those. If your a fan of Sam Harris I think Tumors All The Way Down is my favorite.
Friendly rivals! Tamler has been a guest on PEL.
Usually about giraffes.
"Kant and Freud said it better".
*sigh* remove the "/s" and toss in Kierkegaard and Sartre... God when did I become such a stereotype?
I got em finally. Player FM is great BTW.
I don't know how people concentrate on in-depth discussions whilst also doing some other strenuous thing. I'm so easily distracted that I drift in and out even when I'm doing nothing else. 
I always recommend people starting out with "Wrath of the Kahn's". It's one of the best and rather than making others feel inferior, it actually sets the tone and pace of others and makes them much more approachable. Then I'd work to "Ghosts of the Ostfront". I really wish I was in your shoes again, waiting for them to come out feels impossible sometimes!
At the very least though it has gotten me to want to put more time in to actually reading some of these books. Whether or not that will actually happen though is another story...
Where applicable, I use HoP as reference material in prepping for PEL episodes. Definitely good stuff.
I think the early PEL eps stuck to the philosophy of assuming the audience knows nothing about philosophy and since they've covered so much already and have become experts in a way, what they cover now is very, very high level stuff imo. Great stuff but the early eps were so good for an amateur with only some background.Overall, PEL is still the number one philosophy podcast in my opinion. Only one here I haven't heard is very bad wizards. Going to check it out too.  
 Great episode
Any episode with Paul Bloom as the guest
"You know this reminds me of--obscure french 19th century scientist---" --Dylan
What stereotype?
I think it's actually easier when you're doing a strenuous activity since it acts as something to keep your mind focused on instead of the pain/monotony of the activity. 
Really?  One of their 30 minute jams that just kind of meanders around?  I love it. Great to turn off your brain, but still keep it just engaged enough to pay attention to a run. As long as you know the course. I wouldn't do it in a new environment. 
Just a little self-deprecating humor. Please don't hate me. 
Agreed, it's actually four which is even better! Well worth the price.
Yeah, that's a good idea, I ought to start doing that, although PEL recently has been doing a lot more modern stuff. Also, History of Philosophy in India is pretty good too.
It's a good one. They disagree but the conversation doesn't get derailed. Although towards the end it goes around in circles a little bit.
Here's the dilemma: Stop and review the basics to try to be friendly to new listeners, and you're remedial. Don't do so, and new listeners feel lost. PEL is inconsistent in addressing this; usually, a reference to an earlier episode that one can listen to to learn more must suffice lest things get totally bogged down, but we try to re-summarize where it's important to the current discussion.
When I'm doing strenuous cardio particularly, just feeling completely wiped physically and mentally by the end of both an episode and my session is a nice humble reset button for me before I crash out for the night.
For me just concentrating on my surroundings and avoiding obstacles or passers-by would bring me completely out of focus. 
I guess it depends on your pacing/running habits. It makes me want to lollygag. I'm the type of runner who hates jogging. I either want to be clocking in the 6-8 min mile range or I'd rather just walk. I love me some formless tunes sometimes, but not for running. 
It was funnier to me because there's definitely complex music to listen to, and I also don't like Phish. So insinuating it's dumbed down amuses me.
Honestly its probably most effected by which modality you use as "cardio" like cycling 50miles or running 8 miles, its easier to get into a podcast and world of ideas because you'll enter a flow state after awhile.  Something like doing sprints or sled drags, you'll be exerting too much energy and won't enter a flow state during (you may afterwards though).
I dunno. I've played tennis for over twenty years; that's way more cognitively demanding than just looking where I'm going, a skill you learn when you're two or so years old.
Yeah, I could see that. But a nice, long 2 hour run and it works great for me. 
Sprints and sled drags would be too loud for me to listen at a comfortable volume, anyway. The cardio doesn't influence my engagement with the material, I can similarly wear out my mind without performing cardio. It's just the soft noodle feel in my limbs and mind coming to me after the shower that I find appealing about mixing them.
Chill Dave. 
There is a lyric from The Prince of Egypt movie (wait wait...stay with me) that goes "when all you've got is nothing g,there's a lot to go around." I've always liked that lyric and I feel it is more or less true. There is a stark difference when hanging out with a bunch of "lower class" people vs. "upper class". It's so prevalent that there are plenty of Hollywood movies that touch on this very idea.
SF? Me too.
Yeah, and a person got murdered in his neighborhood. I think this guy isn't seeing the big picture here.
Yeah, I live in the "bad" part of town and I love my apartment and being close to everything, and I don't plan on moving soon. But, I'm finding myself being envious of the house my sister and her husband just bought in the suburbs. It would be nice walk outside of my building and not see vomit or urine or used needles and getting hit up for change or smokes every 10 feet. 
I guess because his neighbourhood isn't too bad, all in. I'm in a similar situation- I moved to the "diverse" part of the city and people talk about it like it's scary, but it is so nice! I never have any trouble and I can get waffles and kebabs at 4am. Living the dream.
Yep. I hear gunshots often, and regularly see police responding to calls but never actively patrolling. Never felt the need to buy a gun before I moved here, but now my roommates and I each keep one in our rooms and we have a "what to do if you have to defend yourself or your home" card on the fridge. The neighbors are all super nice, but I'm sure they all have weapons in their houses as well (though that's pretty much everyone in this town tbh)
I wish the same for Modesto even though Stockton is way worse. 
I would actually, probably be pretty hilarious to murder. You'd be all stabbing me to death with this stupid, serious look on your face and I'd gurgle in my own blood and say, "hey, you missed an organ." 
One single murder does not mean dangerous at all. It could be a neighborhood of 100,000 people. 
Perhaps. My next door neighbor sells weed. A couple weeks ago I answer my doorbell after midnight to find a young black couple utterly surprised to see me answer the door. I told them they were looking for Sha'niece next door. They thanked me and then the guy said, "don't call the cops." "Oh, I wouldn't, why did you even? What? No. Don't worry." I replied. Then I realized he only said that because I am white. It was the first time I was a victim of prejudice. I was pretty excited. It was just like when I got my first pimple. I was so stoked to oxycute it. 
Thankfullly, my neighborhood does not have a gang problem. I see some teenagers walking around at night with their friends and the worst I think they're up to is smoking weed. That's no worse than anything my suburban friends did back in the day. We were probably even dumber, breaking into the local golf course to climb the water tower and drink vodka 100 feet up. Lucky no one died. 
If you give a mouse a cookie...
I've heard the phrase, "don't shit where you eat," but I thought that was just something my mom said to scold my brother for pooping on the dinner table. 
Oh, you will, you're just new so it throws people off. Just say good morning or something to the neighbors every so often if you see them and wish them a good day or someshit and you'll be fine. 
That really sucks that interracial couples still have to deal with prejudice from all sides. The good news is that the type of prejudice you'll face is slowly dying out and will eventually be replaced by us normal people who don't care who you choose to love. 
Shame he'll end up in a morg in a few months 
I fucking love that movie. It has an awesome soundtrack.
Real talk, OP doesn't live in the ghetto.  Listening to the media talk about Ferguson, MO like it was Compton was infuriating.  If you think Ferguson is ghetto than  Martin Luther King and North Garrison will make your hair stand up.
It's probably that rascal Too Tall again. 
This is the best clandestine argument for social welfare programs I've heard. Desperate people do desperate things. It's almost as if a safety net to prevent total squalor lowers crime rates and builds community?
Sounds like those garbage human beings can end your life though. That's the difference.
Yep this. I live right on the edge of the bad parts. In that grey area of slightly OK but occasionally sketchy parts. 
Yup. OP just got lucky. That place will probably become gentrified in a dozen years.
I live near the bad area. There's shootings, murders, and stuff that happen in my neighborhood, though I live right on the edge of it on a main road, so I never see any of it. But for real, just because I don't see it doesn't make it a better area. You just get used to it. 
Regardless, I'd prefer to live where homeless people don't casually stroll through the woods near my house.
Irish terms. Skanger = chav, nacker = gypsy
What gave it away? :D
It's definitely interesting to see what people consider to be the "bad neighborhood". I worked in a bad neighborhood and it wasn't funny, warm happies like this. There is constant crime, people are on the community FB page posting videos of homes being cased, pets are stolen out of yards, cops are responding to gun shots across the neighborhood, teens are dealing drugs and getting shot in broad daylight, kids are going hungry, the mentally ill walk the streets with no aid and no hope, I mean it's insane.
So, I think you're joking, but this comment is pretty insensitive. You're not "a victim of prejudice" because someone who was trying to do something illegal asked you not to call the cops. And to be all giddy and happy about being discriminated against makes you seem privileged and unaware of real struggle.
Lmao holy shit you're crazy. I'd do it with an elevator... Not stairs or a ladder.
I think you may know what I mean. But dude is a decent lick. The homeless dude is probably plotting right now remembering his habits looking for the perfect time.But honestly, I don't think this is OP realizing his prejudices after being in a bad neighborhood. I think is is OP realisingbhis prejudices after living the in a predominantly minority area. I mean, what hood do you know that doesn't have bars on the ground level windows already?
LOLHave you never worked with or around the homeless before?
am i the only one reading OPs comments and think WTF man you got a crackhead that broke into your house and your reaction is to say wrong house ??? so you mean the dude is probably breaking into the wrong house because you were cool with the neighbors and homeless people ??? 
I'll probably die of cancer - early and often. Or maybe we'll hit transcendence before that and ill get to live forever. In the mean time, I don't plan to live in fear. Ask my friends - I'm the type to chase down an alligator and fuck with it. 
It's one of my favorites because if the music. Great animated film!
I'm so glad you're doing better!I'm not at all a religious person but I have always admired that song as just a general upbeat look at what it means to be humble and have a sense of community.
"I see dread people."
Yeah right? There's one time he did bath salts and then cut my dog open to see what's inside. What a ball-buster!
That's a beautiful story. Re: bad neighborhood though, I typically judge a neighborhood based on the murder and burglary rates, so having a murder at the neighborhood's entrance would certainly concern me.
The thing is in my experience growing up in places like that never leave you. You get these street smarts and they always color you, for instance my brothers and i always make sure we have our back to a wall most times, or are ready to fight if someone knocks on our door a little too hard. Stuff like that can really get to you if you can't let it go. 
Same here. The higher letter streets have been gentrified, so you don't want to live anywhere past M street, and Q street is where there is a block of dealers for everything you could want, and a few things you wouldn't (aka a bullet).
That's interesting. In my city, the "wood streets" are the nice ones that everyone wants to live on. 
I know! I don't know how you can look at these people and think anything other than "no one should have to live this way." The fact that so many people don't see the value in helping their fellow man, to the point where they want to hurt them instead, disturbs me.
Anyone can end your life, if they have enough motivation. There's not much difference there.
Its ironic that I had a lot of people walking through the woods in my backyard growing up in a nice area. It was simply the neighborhood cutthrough, that most of the kids in the area knew about. One time I walked out my door and there was a group of kids in my class filming a forensics project...
It's just perspective. I moved to a "bad" neighborhood 7 months ago. In the 90s it would have drive by shootings and hookers and drug dealers on every corner. It's a historic neighborhood that has slowly been revitalized over the past couple decades with houses being renovated and new ones built in empty lots. Everyone I talked to from the suburbs said it was a bad area. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that it did used to be bad. So I wouldn't call it a bad neighborhood anymore. Though there are certain areas on the outskirts that I wouldn't want to go late at night. 
<For the most part, the actual most dangerous parts of the city are former white suburbs>Describes Alief to a "T."
He had previously had a prejudice that poor neighborhoods were automatically bad neighborhoods. He has now learned that is not necessarily the case.
Yup, that's the prejudice you'll likely face. And if you ever complain about being unfairly judged for your family wealth you can expect to hear very little sympathy.  This is not fair. You might not ever live a life wherein you need worry about where your next meal is coming from. But wealth brings about all sorts of other problems that your average person never has to deal with, im sure. In the end, we are all just worm food. The struggle to live a good and useful life is not restricted to the non-wealthy.  
Never underestimate the stupidity of your average teenager. 
One of these days I'll leave for work and say, "love you babe!" and she'll finally reply truthfully and say, "tolerate you, babe!" 
>Aw the little racist is out of his safe space.Lol, you people are the worst. Probably pissed at the comey nothing burger, eh?
ive been clean and not homeless for 2 years, through no effort of my own i have to say, a man who became my best friend offered his place to me while i was detoxing and getting back on my feet, i was in a psych ward for a bit, and after living with my best friend i moved in with my partner, without them i would still be on the streets (or likely dead thanks to the drug abuse), ive made strides dealing with mental health but im still struggling thanks for reminding me to be grateful, im so selfish i only think about my current struggles and fail to remember the shit i was in in the past
drugs and the bad things i did and the bad people i knew in order to get drugsill expand in PM if you want me to, my life is a wild and traumatic ride 
What's he gonna do, stab you?
More dangerous for the homeless, not the homeowners. Even walking down the sidewalk can get you swarmed by cops in some cases. Also, there was a time years ago when I associated with a lot of wealthy people. The actual run of the mill non-violent crime, especially drugs, in rich neighborhoods is every bit as high as it is in poor neighborhoods. It's just much more invisible with far less police presents constantly harassing them. Though years ago a friend of mine, the son of the city manager, got raided. Which means they raided the city managers house. Not much happened to him though.
I have to say, I feel lucky too being a large white guy. I'm only about 6' but at 300 lbs, of not all fat, I also don't look like the kind of person people would like to mess with. I always wonder if it had a significant impact on people leaving me alone. TBH I did notice a lot of white people who had a problem with it too, but they tend to keep it to themselves to a greater degree. A lot of older white folks were pretty "disturbed" they just also didn't tend to say anything or glare for long. They were more of the type for quietly talking about you behind a hand lol.
Thanks, dude. :)I am religious but I think the song just has a lot going for it on a general human level. Not being religious doesn't mean the world has to be seen as hopeless and devoid of meaning. We may define it, but I think it's worth believing in that bigger picture because it's something beautiful
Poverty in general stays with you forever. Too lazy to find the source again, but poverty makes detectable structural changes in the brain. 
"fuck you i got mine". A lot of people just don't care about anything happening past their doorstep, or anything that's visibly out of the way. 
Social welfare programs provide different things than jobs.
...Yes, that's true, but doesn't really compare.  The joe-schmo sipping coffee in a cafe is far less likely to shoot you than the guy pointing a gun at you.
Movies like Boyz in the Hood and Blood In Blood Out are pretty accurate depictions of young life in South Central and East LA at the time.  Things have changed(murder rate and violent crimes plummeted), but there's still areas and people you want to avoid if you can.  Old ways die hard 
This is honestly just cities in general, they change an insane amount over the distance of just a few blocks. I live Cincinnati and just north of Downtown in OTR is an incredibly nice, urban area with great places to live that I would definitely call safe, but I would never even consider living literally 3 blocks up the street from this district
>But wealth brings about all sorts of other problems that your average person never has to deal with, im sure.All I ask is the chance to prove that money cannot make me happy. 
Don't know about you, but every poor person I've ever met was poor.
That's exactly how I feel. I don't expect everyone to agree. But I'm surprised it's such a bizarre notion to some people. 
It's a fine line. 
I would say that the homeless part of addiction is probably the best part. I also struggle with addiction and being homeless was the easiest part of that by far. May the fourth is my clean day. Congrats on staying clean for two years that made my heart happy to read
Famous last words
Thank you for sharing! :)
"They should just work harder, you make your own luck in America." seems to be the general attitude 
I'm not trying to describe the Republican party. I'm trying to describe the actions of the elected Republican congressmen, and to a degree the disgust toward lower classes that a not insignificant portion of the vocal Republican base tends to exhibit.
LOL I was there last summer. Walked from downtown to OTR's main strip. That was fine.Then I walked to Rheingeist. That was...interesting.
Money won't make you happy but a lack of it will really suck ass.
 I've never met a poor rich person
may the fourth be with you!
Fair enough.  The congressmen would at least say they're operating under the more compassionate principle, but I can't deny that their actions often speak otherwise, and you're not wrong about the vocal Republicans.
Exactly. Anyone who suggests having money is just as bad as not having it, as I interpreted the OP saying, doesn't have a very realistic view of the world. 
That's humbling to read. Now you've got me blushing. What I said is simply the truth - as I see it. And I can easily  and honestly reply that there are too few people like you in this world. Take a moment to allow yourself to be self-indulgent and explore the truth in that statement and blush too. There's nothing wrong with giving yourself a pat on the back here and there. Sometimes it's the only encouragement you'll ever receive to keep you moving forward. Be kind to yourself. It sounds simple, but it's not. 
So I have club feet, too. I just want you to know that all the bad stuff happens when they are kids. I had surgeries, I had the casts, and I had the special shoes. I barely remember all of that. As an adult, no one realizes anything is wrong with me. Heck, I barely remember myself! It only really comes up when I run too far or swim too much. And even then its only pain like what I imagine arthritis is like. Heck, I even ran a half marathon! ...thought I'll never do that again!
I just read through all of this, an I can say without a doubt you both are the type of people we need more of in this world. Stay positive and stay awesome guys.
That's awesome. That's what we're hoping for. Right now, unless you know what to look for you wouldn't see it. Thankfully she doesn't even surgery. It's been as mild as I could have hoped for. 
I just read through all of this, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that you three are the type of people we need more of in this world. Stay positive and stay awesome, guys.
Then I have a much more severe case. I have a scar running all along both feet. It's not a bad scar, though. So even with surgery she will be ok.
Whoa. What's the "AROUND" operator? I've never seen that before. Is there a list of such operators?
This was actually one of my first thoughts. But based on their comment history I really don't think I know them. They seem to live on a different continent to me.I can only assume that, at some point, I mentioned this on Reddit. It's still amazing though - if I did mention it, it would have been a year ago, and it can't have been a particularly popular thread. Maybe tomorrow, when I've calmed down, I'll go through my comment history and try to figure this out. But then again, I kinda enjoy the mystery of it all. Maybe I'll just leave it...
What song? My advice would be to post it to a random thread on Reddit, wait a year or so, and eventually some random person will PM you a link. It worked for me, it'll probably work for you too. 
The journey was better than the destination. 
Thanks! I'm glad you enjoyed it
That's the one!
Yeah I like it. Me jamming to it is helping with my paper grading in any case :D
Modern TV's should have an option for song titles to appear in the corner of the screen :o.
And the YouTube comments section for the ad is now filled with "Shh bby is ok".
Gotta love reddit 
A little bit
Shh bby is ok
> Turn the lights down Artist - BSO
It looks like BSO stands for "Banda Sonora Original". In English that means "Original Soundtrack".
!!!Or the Illuminati? 
Haha really? Tracking down the driver, that's impressive. You are my kindred spirit. We made it!I had to delete that YouTube comment, it had my real name associated with it. 
Shazam app?
Well I'm directing people to an ad for a car, so I thought people might accuse me of working for Seat. I wanted to prove that I wasn't. It didn't help, people are still accusing me of working for the Seat marketing department. They're also accusing me of being a member of BSO, or setting up the whole thing using alt accounts. You've just gotta laugh, really. 
OK now I'm really freaked out. HOW DO THEY KNOW I'VE GOT A REALLY SMALL DICK?!?!?!? I know for a fact I've never posted pictures of my dick on Reddit. 
I think it's you from the future.
What that means? 
You sound like an authority on this, NakedAndBehindYou.
pns in vga then bby.
x AROUND(n) y finds x within n words of y. I stumbled upon it randomly, so I don't have a list for you. 
Holy hell that's how I found the cursed ad... I can't believe answers have been found!
They might not have needed to remember it a year later - it's possible that they came across the thread, researched it, found the answer, realised they could no longer respond to the thread (Reddit doesn't let you respond to threads more than 6 months old) and PMed you instead. I know I've done that before.But yes, it's fantastic when that works out. :D And I'm sorry for spoiling it - I know you said that you might just leave it because you liked the mystery. (I don't know if you caught my original comment before making it less spoilery - it was a lot more direct. If so, I apologise!)
I'd leave it. Keeps it exciting.
I actually know the name, I'm just looking for a specific recording.It's an aria from Don Giovanni, I heard it in the movie Screamers but I can't find that version anywhere. It was probably recorded specifically for the movie and for some reason never released to the public.
I have, but still no luck.
Like the Dark Tower.
It really ruined the whole story to know OP has such a shit taste in music. 
Shazam is great for that.
It is in fact a real song, Polaris came to my city recently and I got the chance to see them. They're such an amazing band. 
Hahahahaha
Nice meme.
Yeah I got friends that talk like that through text too.
I bet it's an employee of whichever intelligence agency in the UK is responsible for spying on people on line and you are one of their persons of interest. 
I've never actually used it, and to be honest it's kind of fun actually googling the lyrics and trying to find the songs, it's like a treasure hunt :p
Shh bby is ok
Only plausible explanationI don't know if you wasted your time travel or if you did the best possible thing with it OP
But OP says he's never mentioned this on reddit. Just in the YouTube comments and to his irl friends. Maybe one of his friends knows his username? 
my worst nightmare
And why do you keep calling them baby?
I Just found a thread and looked for the song..
Magic ones 
I know sweetiepie 
It's like a whoooleee neeewww wooorrrllddd.
Do you put the yellow dot next to your name so we think you got gold and read your comment?
No sweat bro
I was never good at my Job as a paper delivery boy so we will se if I still got it :P
My alternate name is: see-People-in-need-man. The catch is it only works a year to late :P
I felt the dank maymays and Just found it.
IT'S ME GUYS IT'S ME
GO-FUCK-YOURSELF.Easy win m8
Shh = comforting quieting soundbby = baby, term of endearmentis ok = it's ok, no need to get worked up, it's all good
Theyre not the first person to say that rofl
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now!
Shut up baby I know it :)
You should sign up for the reddit secret santa then put this in there as a *wink wink nudge nudge* haha :)
Holy crap on a cracker!  I've seen dozens of lists of "useful google tricks" but never this one.  It should be on all of them.
shh bby is okay
I think you mean "shh bby is okay to kith"
Yeah that is it 
Yeah, I clearly got that bit wrong... I could have sworn it was me! It was ages ago, my memory is a bit fuzzy. The plot thickens!
Yep, I misremembered a few details in this story. I completely forgot that I had even posted about it on Reddit! My memory is awful. 
Yep that's right! I completely forgot about posting on Reddit (hence my crazy reaction to the PM haha), but I knew I had seen a reply from their marketing department, and knew that I had been intending to ask them about it. So in my head I thought I had actually got round to sending that email. I'm really forgetful, so it's not out of the question that I sent out a quick email even if I couldn't really remember doing it. Someone in the comments dug out that old thread I had made - at that point it finally all started to make sense. That's where I got the screenshot from. 
Yea... kinda makes me wanna believe in Santa again.
argh, I know that feeling. I've been looking for a specific recording of Julie London singing "Bye, Bye, Blackbird" for almost 8 years now. I think there was a video too but nothing I can find on youtube is the right video.
Hey, King interrupted the book to warn you not to read the Coda. And just like Roland, you didn't cry off when the journey was complete and the Tower safe, you just had to see what was at the top.
Yeah, much better. The song itself is *alright* in my opinion, but I won't be downloading it or anything. I guess it's also that I couldn't find it... You know how you always want what you can't get? The song became legendary simply because I couldn't find it.
Unfortunately. It was a good story well told, but I do find it hard to empathise with someone listening to that ad daily for that tiny snippet of such an ordinary song.
is ok meme
You missed the part where he actually completes the piece with the original composer on one of his journeys in time.
Ok, that's the truth. I can stop being weirded out. Good,I hate unanswerable questions. 
Shh bby is ok
**B**oot**S**trap **O**p
How about the same / very similar username on youtube and reddit? The guy who PM'd OP forgot it was a youtube comment he knew OP from and thought it might have been Reddit, tried finding the user and got lucky, freaking OP out in the process.
Shh bby is ok
"Which I did" is not very clear...
Shut up baby I know it :)
22 hours to go! 
hah, yeah someone in the /r/bestof thread just explained it all. still cool, but not exactly the mystery I thought it'd be
Not Viking ones?
oh my god you have me in tears between shh bby is ok and this
I was on mobile so I didn't even notice haha. Usually when I make a flair I make it yellow because that's my favourite colour, but that's a pretty good theory as well!
Shh bby is ok. 
ITS YOU! OH MAH GAWD ITS YOU!! 
Gee, you should at least send him a t-shirt. It's his line generating you money...
I think it's because it's slightly too complicated for the average laymen. I mean, it's not complicated, but it is more complicated than most of the tricks.
If it's on a bullshit infographic and you end up using it, is it still bullshit?
God damn it. Someone always thinks of something better. 
You're a mensch, sir. 
The spoiler alerts are many *now*, but my initial post had no spoiler warnings and was a lot more direct, as I said. I didn't know if they had caught it before I edited it or not, and was apologising just in case they had.
You and jadedDarkness are the same person.You are also the "mystery redditor". You may also be a soap manufacturer or IT Security guy, who is hell bent on erasing society's debt.I am not sure which, but I will be sure to send you my building society details and account numbers so you don't miss them.
So...you're not really that determined after all?
It's especially infuriating because you know exactly what you're looking for, yet you can't find it anywhere.
Thanks! Yeah I know what it's about, haha. It's like in The Marriage of Figaro there's a really dramatic part and she's just singing about losing a hair pin. 
Reddit will kill it by overusing in two days.
No...he is the composer.
What if his real life friends don't know his reddit account?Stay tuned.
That's a lot of effort just to tell someone the name of a song.
This is going to take over reddit for the next few weeks. Calling it now.
I have excellent taste. 
OP said it was a year ago, so a post 4 months old he'd have missed.
It was a matter of finding the song. Which he did. He found the song. Shh
Why does this keep happening? Did I miss some sort of reference? What's the point of telling me how long until I get a RemindMe and why are so many people doing it?
the infographic can still be bullshit with or without useful information
Bless you. Gesundheit
*Shh bby is ok
Because you touch yourself at night. 
Every account on reddit is /u/franklymydeer except you.
>two dayslol, talk to me tomorrow morning.
In future Reddit they do, his future self is going for the long con.
The real question is how many hours do you put into Minecraft?
If I knew the song, and knew how much he wanted to find it, I'd definitely go out of my way to send it to them. 
Shut up baby i know it :)
Shut up baby I know it :)
You are such a tease
First let us ASSess the damage...
Makes sense.
Easily the best story I've read on t'interweb
I figured it was Miike Snow when I saw "Mike Something" Miike Snow has that pop-indie sound that commercials love. 
Well black guy, there's no reliable way to gauge since Minecraft resets my statistics whenever it damn well pleases.  But If I had to put a number on it I'd say its greater than a thousand.
That's just a quote from Bender from Futurama so it doesn't count.
Mystery Redditor only realised because he was in /r/fo4 and somebody said "shh bby is ok". That's my favourite part of this whole story.
And it's written by Andy Weir who is also the author of The Martian.
Yup same!I think I actually first started listening to them after Black and Blue was in a commercial, googled the lyrics etc.
There must be some way out of here, said the Joker to the Thief...
Yea. That's what I was referencing lol
We love you bender..
DAMN that guy is good! 
The best way to find indie music.  I fell back in love with Kashi Bashi recently after one of his songs was in a phone commercial. 
Why do I get the feeling that I've seen this comment before?Nah, I'm just kidding. A Bob Dylan song couldn't possibly be a major plot point in the universe!^^^^^^^REFERENCES ^^^^^^^HO!
Shut up baby I know it :)
What did you guys play?
THIS.  SLEEP NOW!  I have a 9 year old and I haven't slept since BEFORE he was born.  Also, congratulations.  There is nothing better than fatherhood!
Same, Ireland here!
Congratulations!!!!!My husband and I tried for a year, saw the doctor, started fertility drugs, and got pregnant and had a healthy, happy baby. (Yay!) On his first birthday, we discovered we were having another one. (Oops.) Everything worked out fine-the kids are closer in age than we'd hoped, 20 months-but I just want to warn you, trouble conceiving once doesn't mean trouble conceiving always! Lol! Seriously, parenthood is amazing. Congratulations to you and your wife. 
It felt real good when I did the sex with my penis 
And /r/predaddit 
Literally looked through all the comments looking for this one. Thanks for bolding it xD
Congratulations!
Man. That's shit.
Also, congratulate him on not pulling out.
27 and 22 ay? Ok well do you mind if I message you sporadically for the next two decades about advice?
Whey, congrats! I reckon September, which is kinda bad timing coz we've got three weddings but fuck it!
He's gotta stock up on the jokes now
No idea! Don't wanna know till the day of arrival!
Woohoo scotch! Congrats!
Same here, but if OP is stoked about it, hooray for him!
Bulla bus for us so!
I'm genuinely in shock and excitement. I've never felt like this before, I'm seeing the world in a whole new light!
Congrats to you as well! I hope everything goes smoothly. 
Thanks! We worked it out and we reckon it's around beginning of September 
Healthy. Cliche but boy or girl doesn't bother me, I'm already raising a step child at the moment. Kinda freaked out about if anything goes wrong though.
It takes 9 months though.. your cover as a human is showing. 
If you're not in America or the UK that's irrelevant, because that's where 90% of redditors are.
Cool? Nope, not mine anyway!
Asking the important questions. 
But which one do you REALLY want it to be?  (Pro tip: reply with both and delete the one that it is not once you find out)
Thank you, I actually didn't know that!
Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns AND missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry, an absolute death machine.
6 kids?!?? how do u even manage!!
It's ok seriously. I have a 9 year old and a 1 year old. I forgot how much sleep you lose but once you hit a certain age they do start sleeping later. You will get your sleep back it just might take a couple years. 
Hej, tillykke fra denmak!
I've got one of those from Heathrow to LAX in about twelve hours. Not looking forward to it. 
Awesome! Thanks!!!!
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened. 
Whoaaaaaa THAT'S A LOT OF SEXY SEXY
You can tell Mom about r/babybumps and r/beyondthebump too. They're really supportive :)
You know, next time you could use ctrl+f after expanding all the comments...
I respect his commitment to the reproduction of our species.
That's gong to be torture on your wife. So be wary
We did that. It was so much fun!
Well, im hopefull! Looking forward to the challenges too be honest :) 
Nice! But lots of 0 to 3 fleecy pjs
Fiiiiiine. Well done OP, I hope you make a great dad
Trimesters are big milestones in development.  Usually involve sonograms and are common points of reference.  
I'm in the UK.
No response! OP needs to get his priorities straight.
Oh that's what I wanted for Christmas! I got Pandemic: State of Emergency and On the Brink expansions, so it's cool :D Can't wait to try it after my finals end.
**two** games of risk? How did it not take a week?!
The correct response is "we just want a happy and healthy baby."
No problem friend! You have a great day now.
I mean, clearly he wasn't including Apache helicopters in that statement - he was speaking in hyperbole. With its speed, maneuverability, and armament, nothing can realistically be compared to the AH-64.Also, Apaches don't poop.Carry on, /u/jelly_doughnut. We understand that you didn't mean to insult the Apache.
He said he doesn't sleep. That's 8 more hours a day to get things done.
Girls 4, 8, 11, 17Boys 13, 15Hers, mine, and ours. The 17 year old is the only one I didn't go through infant stage with. 
What what, tillyke fra Danmark til papa!
Go raibh maith agut. You'll have to forgive the lack of fadas, my Irish has been shite since leaving the CBS
Good luck!
Havin' sex can make a nice man out the meanest
Or a really *really* lucky sexy sexy.
I was about to ask if there was a /r/momddit
Goddamit pvt. kballs!(ps congrats!) 
As I read this in in fleecy Harry Potter pjs so I'm way ahead if you!
If the father to be can respond then so can the board gamer
We just started playing the base game. Which expansions are best? 
I dunno! I always remember Risk taking absolutely forever, but these games only took 1-2 hours. Maybe because we're just not very good?
What's the difference exactly?
I've heard of Betrayal, but I've no idea what it's about.
Thanks, you too! Anything in particular planned?
Apples and Oranges of course!
Det er rigtig!
Everyone just read that in his voice. 
There is r/mommit
Omg that sounds like heaven!
Penny for the smart kitty.
Every expansion has multiple modules, so they are more of like multiple-expansions-packs. I like most modules in both expansion packs. They add different kinds of flavors and make the game (generally) harder, you can make different combinations of them to make different experiences. Personally I would start with playing base until you want more and then buy the first expansion pack. Then play with it until you want more and get the following expansion pack. 
It allows up to 8 players with some added cards that feel really natural. The cards are also bigger and thicker. Basically card stock. It also come with sleeves that fit the theme. Oh! And wooden hearts.
Oh boy! I'm staying home from work today, looking after my 2 sons, 4 and 1.5 years. It has already been an eventful day, and 90 minutes before my wife gets home...How about you? What was your New Year's like?
I had the snip. 
I'm fraud_93_is_a_stupid_pantsGotcha!
Yep, that sounds about right. The difficulty level of the base game we're still coming to terms with. Thanks! 
That does sound cool. The hearts are instead of the kinda sucky red cubes as Tokens of Affection? What're some of the added cards?
My New Year's Eve was pretty quiet, which is how I like it really. I went out to a nice, relatively early event with my parents (picnic where they were showing Zootopia, which is great). At home, I stayed up unreasonably late watching Doctor Who (specifically the episode The Power of Three, which has become a tradition for me) and a bit of a charity stream on Twitch.
Not even stupid in a funny way.
That sounds...nice and quiet.  I'm jealous. I wouldn't trade my kids for anything, but I do fantasize about sleeping in now and again. It's the quiet you miss.

Thank you! It is a big step but so far so good. 
I'm sorry, come by and I'll bake you some cookies. :)
Haha I told his Sister and she told him how disgusting he was before I let her in on it.  It was pretty funny.  
I'll do what I can to limit the frat parties.  Thank you! 
Wow, I'm proud of her, too! I hope I can be as successful.  
I'm sorry I toyed with your emotions. My ex husband was a jerk, you can comfort me about that? 
Thank you!  I hope you laughed
Haha, well it's a short walk to crazy from here, I won't let them waste the gas driving.  
Haha I'm like 10 yrs older than my professor this semester.  I should! 
Haha, thank you!  He does think I'm awesome.  He has 13 degrees himself.  Masters and a few bachelor's and associates. He is so very encouraging!  He thinks I'm the best thing since sliced bread.  I just appreciate him so much.  He thinks I'm smart, so I'm just going to work hard and do my best.  
Um... Tommy Chong has rectal cancer. Is that better? That ruined my day.  :p
You mean refrain? I'm sorry.  I thought I was being funny.  I'll try again.  
Really? That's great! Was it hard?  I'm kind of worried I am not smart enough anymore.  No school in like 28 yrs.  So far so good but I heard the program is hard
I was, too.  And I believe you should be!  It's so very important.  There's always time for other stuff later.  
I baited a catatafish?  That's kind of funny!  Still not sure if it was wrong or not! 
Haha thank you! 
I'm glad you liked it! 
Oh, that's awful and awesome!  Wait... You know what I mean!  So what are you studying? 
Dorm sex would be weird!  Thank you! Best wishes to you.  What are you studying? 
Thank you so much!!  I'm happy for your mom, as well! Tell her an internet stranger is proud of her! 
Why ,thank you!
It's really strange that so many people care what I have to say and actually like what they hear.  I'm really shocked.  This is a quiet,  little sub of nice people, and I just thought I'd get a little laugh.  It's really weird.  
I'm from the mid US.  There is a history of inherited mental illness in our family.  Passed from my grandfather (I suspect) to my mother, to me, to my children ,one of whom killed himself.  I've been drawn to the mentally ill for some time and enjoy helping them. What are your views? 
Thank you.  How is it for you? 
It's really different to be back in a classroom after 28 yrs.  Trying to relearn how to learn.  But so far so good! 
Haha thank you! 
My husband does it with grandmas.  Well... One anyway.  ;)
It's crazy!  I was just trying to be funny.  I had no idea!lol
That's wonderful!  I hadn't thought of being a practitioner in psychiatry.  That's something to think about.  I'm so glad she has helped you.  
He does, too!  He tells his work mates all the time!  Actually, he tells them all kinds of stuff.  Lol
Lol, I'm pretty shocked anyone cared!  
I know I'm a bad person.  I'm sorry... Kinda... Sorta. 
Aww!  I'm sorry I made you feel bad! I usually only use my super power on my kids!  Lol. And thank you! Also.... You be you.  If it makes you happy, and no one is being lied to,  do you.  
Technically, I'm a grandmother so.... :)
Thank you! 
Thank you! Haha
Thank you!  Send me the bill from the cardiologist.  Or you could wait until I'm a nurse and I'll check on you! 
Thank you! I appreciate hearing that! 
I need to look that up! That's good, right? 
Thank you! I'll do my best! 
Thank you! I'm so excited. I've gotten A's in my first class on everything.  I've never done a power point before and I scored over on it.  It was pretty fun! 
I have no idea!  Put it in your Google calendar? Thank you for the thought! 
Thank you! 
Few reasons. My mother was ill, and she passed it to me, in turn I passed it to my son who committed suicide 8 yrs ago. I didn't know I was sick, just thought all the crazy ups and downs were normal. Didn't know my mom was sick until recently because she died before I was two. I have a feeling, reading her file, it was not an accident when she died. I've always been drawn to the mentally ill, and I just want to help the people that are closest to my heart. I believe because I was sick and am now stable several years, that I have a unique perspective to offer and give hope.

Haha ,see I've stimulated your brain today! 
That would be awesome! Haha 
Yeah, that was kind of the joke,  sorry, I'm the freshman.  
Thank you! 
That's really encouraging!  I hope I do well.  Nervous still! But I'm doing OK so far.  Have A on everything so far
Oh, it's juicy alright.  ;)
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
I'm not even sorry.  Well, a little.  :)
Came here for some dirt, didn't you? Lol
Things are good.  4 yrs ago life really sucked.  I'd felt like I lost everything, but it turned out that my ex husband was worse than I thought he was, and losing him was the best thing for me.  My youngest moved out, and now we have a great relationship, my new husband is incredibly supportive and so far I've gotten an A or above on all my assignments.  I'm really happy and putting a lot of effort in not waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I'm living in today.  And today is amazing.  How are you? 
Thank you!  Yes, like an episode of snapped and I'd be getting my degree in prison .lol
Thank you! 
Thank you!  You are awesome, by the way.  Good job!  I'm nervous but I really want this.  
Nope, average height and clean shaven.  Amazing wavy hair. 
Thank you! 
Thank you! And you are welcome! 
I can.  I don't mind.  I raised 4 kids.  I'm used to it.  :)
I think it depends on where you go.  Some nursing is more hands on.  Thank you, though. 
Lol, thank you!  Hopefully I will do OK 
Haha thank you!  My humor is a little.... Different 
There are! And I'm really excited about exploring as many as I can.  Thank you! 
I'm going to order one first thing tomorrow!  I'll wear pigtails and everything.  Lol
No, we are married.  I just started school so I am a freshman in college, so the freshman he is sleeping with is me, see? 
Thank you!  I appreciate those in the field so much.  They have a hard job, but it's so rewarding when you can help. 
Wow! You are welcome!  I'm so happy right now!! You will be amazing!  Thank you! 
I'm sorry,  take a deep breath and have a drink of water.  Head over to /r/aww for a minute to regroup.  :)   and thank you.  :)
I will do that!  And thank you!  Your mom is a special lady.  My grandmother was a nurse, eventually the director of nurses at her hospital.  People would stop me on the street years later and tell me about how she was an angel of mercy to them.  I don't want all that,and neither did she. I just want to help people.  Hug your mom for me.  I'll message you later. 
:) I'm glad.  I like making people happy.  It's my best and worst feature. 
Oh, wow! That's awesome!  I needed to hear that!  
Haha thank you! I love you, too! 
I don't know, I'm kinda hot... Sorta.  I guess. 
We do have one on the ceiling... That would have been funny.  Haha
My late mother was a prominent scholar and professor teaching in universities in several countries and working on key projects for the EU. She never stopped her academic work while raising us. 
Haha thank you! 
Thank you! 
I spend too much time in that sub, and that's EXACTLY what it would say!  Sometimes I'm over there and I just think... Wow... Really?  
Haha I'm sorry.  And thank you! 
Because I am the freshman.  :)
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
I think about that.  In fact, it almost scared me away from talking in class.  I don't say those kinds of things, though.  :)
Thank you!  I appreciate hearing that I'm brave!  Because it was really scary and still is.  So far so good. 
:)  what was the other good thing? 
Lol, no I had not.  Let's see how my writing class goes first. 
Ah! Nice!  So what did you decide to be when you grew up? 
Yes, he insisted I needed a 'younger man' in my life.  He's such a goober. 
Lol thank you! 
Thanks!  I appreciate all of it!  Maybe I'll have him carry my books.  ;) you are too cool.  
Lol thank you! Sorry I broke your brain
Thank you!  I've gotten a's so far, but it looks like I might get a b in English.  I was upset but then I realized half the class dropped out so... I guess an 88 so far is good! 
Thank you! 
Oh I feel bad! I'm sorry.  You OK? 
I'm sorry I thought I was being funny. 
But instead I made you happy? 
You can, the sex is really great.  
So.... I'm a master-baiter?  
Everyone is so nice here. :)  thank you! 
Thank you.  Hopefully I'll enjoy it!  If not,  I look into another aspect of nursing.  I really feel like that is where I belong.  
Nah, this was clever. Usually they're annoying though

Good for you, it can be tough to keep the bedroom romance going over the years. ;)
A woman let me stick my penis inside of herrrrrr!
Hearing Instrument Technology? I know a few people that went back for one of those too!You know, there's that stigma that having classes with one of your parents would be embarrassing. But really, I would just be proud of them and happy to have someone to study with/keep me motivated.The mom/dad jokes would be okay too. Any friends that weren't okay with it wouldn't be worthwhile friends.
Don't be making undeliverable promises, now, OP! We'll be seeing you in /r/food! 
Good thing she didn't start crying and apologising for not saying anything earlier.
I've always wanted a Christian Bale, too :3 
hahahah. Yes - "it's okay. you have a new, better husband now."
Haha I did. My second thought was "huh, maybe ALL the mods have been too busy the past few hours...?" Then I read the rest and laughed because I got trolled. Very well done. 
13? Half his resume is education history O.o
There is cancer in places that there should never be cancer. Can he press charges against the cancer? I suspect this invasion was not consentual.
I mean your thread is still up. We just don't want to fall into the same 'click bait' titled nature of other subs. 
You'll probably destroy the grading curves in all your classes!
Thanks.  Social Work :)
Yeah... those tiny beds! GAH!  Engineering.  Gotta love math to do it 
I like it. I went to nursing school specifically with psych nursing in mind. My worst day of psych nursing is still better than my best day at my last job (worked in research). My mom graduated from RN school at 50 years old and went into psych. She is now retired but said it is one of the best decisions she's ever made.
I wish you luck ! You have all my respect for going back to school just so you can do what you like !
You're talking about the collectively NICEST people on Reddit. Of course they'll care!
The worst! Haha. Good luck with the degree. You can do it.
You are welcome! :D
That makes me smile so much! Congrats!! That's a great achievement :DAlso, if you get sick of PowerPoint, check out Prezi. It's a little different, but still fun! 
I have been looking into going to school for my RPN for a couple years now. I never wanted to be a nurse in my life, but I would love to be a counsellor. Psychiatric Nursing scares me, because I have never thought I was smart enough or strong enough to do it. I like your story, and can relate. You have inspired me to give schooling to be a RPN another look. Thank you. And good luck!
No, I felt sad that your husband was cheating on you :(
Im doing alright, nothing much to report, thanks for asking though.
Good.  It can be a rewarding field.
ER nurses for example are definitely hands on. Psychiatric nurses not so much. I worked in the top Psych hospital in the US. You would shit yourself if you knew some of the people who were inpatients there. People from all over the world. I left the field when insurance reform hit around 1996.
Good luck!
Why didn't i get this at first time.. so stupid me
Sounds like you guys like to have fun lol. I have always been intrigued by the mirror on the ceiling. 
Polyamory, to be honest.
Well....I started out in political science, then business administration, then public relations followed up with MIS. After years of misguidance and misdirection, I graduated with an Interdisciplinary Studies degree since it used most of my random credits. I've been in IT for 15 years so....lol! HR at my job really just wanted a(ny) degree to justify the pay raise.
Well I'm 2.5 years older than my bf, and I like it this way. 
That's alright. It had a couple stress fractures in it already. It was bound to happen sooner or later.;)
Oh, I'm ok now.  What's the opposite of vomiting? Because that's what I did when it turned out to be great news!
You did :D
Thank you, I wasn't trying to offend anyone, just being funny.  
M. Naughty Salamidong
Wait are you serious
We need another twist to get us back on track.
No it's candy bar 
Well, we try to keep it fresh, lol
Thank you!  This is so encouraging!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who loves these people! 
That's really encouraging.  I hope I can succeed as well! 
I'm not one to argue with a good thing, she could be my wife!     That good?The best 30 seconds of my life!
Health Into Technology actually, but that's also another one that people seem to flock to! There were people in one of our classes that tried to determine if we were siblings or dating (she looks really young for her age), so there was that! Slightly embarrassing there for a bit, but we were easily able to laugh it off.
Oh, I need to post there! I have the prefect cake for it! 
I gave a short, lecherous chuckle but this may be the wrong subreddit for wincest jokes ;-p
Now we both feel better! 
I suspect it is not at all consentual.  I think he needs an eviction notice and a lawyer. 
Thank you for leaving it up.  I appreciate that.  I'll be more careful.  (wasn't being a smart ass about refrain, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to  reframe my post)  
Haha I hope so! That would be awesome! 
You are so right.  I've lurked here for a couple months and never posted.  The people are just amazing!  
Thank you! 
Thank you!  Oh, is it easier? Or cooler? 
Oh, wow.  I'm glad I could help!  You can do this!!  I thought about counseling, but having lost a son to suicide, I couldn't take the burden.  I'm sure you will do great! Keep me posted! 
Oh, I'm sorry!  Well I hope you are happier now! 
Huh, that's really interesting.  I'm sure a lot more people are hospitalized than we think are.  I think the nice thing about nursing is there are so many avenues.  I'm hoping I like psych, if I don't, hopefully I can do something else. What do you do now? 
We do enjoy ourselves.  The mirror is awesome unless you are just laying there, and you look up and see what you REALLY look like laying down!  Everything just kind of spreeaaaddds out.  
Oh yes, that would also work. He's not that open minded.  Lol
Wow you sound like my husband!  He's got over a dozen degrees lol, programmer for 15 yrs the only thing he doesn't have a degree in.  He's pretty over the whole desk job thing now.  You know, they really do just want a degree.  In anything.  A higher up at a company here in town has a masters in religion.  Nothing is further from his job!  You are awesome, good job! 
Not sure whether you pooped or you ate... 
I'm glad! 
I hadn't heard of this sub before it appeared on /all, with most of the upvotes presumably due to your title.So yeah, you seem to have done that right.
I would watch a porn called this, if it was basically all just crazy over the top twists.Like the guy cums, the camera zooms out, and the girl was actually a pizza all along
So some bondage BDSM now and then?
You are quite right, I got too caught up in making the joke.
People have trouble judging ages in general.Sounds like a fun experience overall!
oh! Post in /r/baking if you haven't already!
ha, i donnnn't think that was the implication.
ha it's cool. Sometimes I spell stuff wrong. 
Good luck!
Thank you, I think it will be a very fulfilling career. I'm a support worker right now, working with adults with mental disabilities, and I enjoy it, a lot. But I feel like I could be doing more with my life to really help people. I think you have a great attitude and you will go far with it, especially since you have so much of your own mental health experience. I look forward to an update from you in the future to hear how awesome you are doing!

"WHOOMP THERE IT IS"p/s: what I saw when I upvoted you. This almost feel too coincidental to be true. Are these mods real? Maybe mods are just a collective manifestation of a supercomputer hiding behind reddit. Is this sub real, or is this an alternate reality? What does 'real' even mean? 42?

The message you are looking for is in another upvote 
Are you on a PC?  Use FireFox or Chrome.  That appears to be the browsers that show the upquotes as someone called them.  Upvote people on this sub and a quote appears.  You have to be fast, because it's in red and it fades upwards quite quickly.  If you miss it, upvote again, the arrow becomes gray and if you upvote again you can see the message again.  Keep doing those steps until you can read the message completely.  Hope that helps."What are these words?"

THIS IS SPARTA!
Well....no. I now got "Mark i did not heet her"
"Batman upvotes, too" I'm just going to upvote everyone on this sub from now on. 
my interpretation is that it would be the same for that initial comment but others that they make will be different, I've had other things to look into with other subs though so I haven't put in a lot of effort into it
I've noticed this as well. I'll try to mess around with the CSS.
Random lol I wonder what they mean or how that happened. 
Ok, thanks for the explanation!
Thanks ! I'll have to check it out. 
Was that an insult? :P"Come on and slam!"

I'm guessing too it has to do with adblock.  You upvote any comment and a quote fades upwards.  Too bad, it has been so much fun how people are going back and forth with silly made up quotes.  I used my mobile and I was able to see it on there also.  I was using the non mobile version.  Just regular internet through the phone, log in to reddit and voila there they are.

I'm still owning up to my promise. I just have yet to get to a desktop/laptop computer. (or respond to the right comment, oops.)**edit** "tiz is still the best" for your other comment and "what are these words?" for this one.

Too bad u/Sloth_Of_Doom cant get multiple upvotes i had to upvote, unupvote and reupvote quite a few times to make sure it came out right. WHOOMP THERE IT IS!
Maybe its odd to say, but I would imagine that particular night  was much worse for my friends and family than it was for me. The recovery afterwards definately sucked though.
Asking the real questions.
No problem! Most people think that its really strange that I was concious up until the fact. A lot of the doctors wanted to interview me about the experience after they had found out.
Thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed reading it.
At least I made an impression somewhere, I suppose haha
The girl did survive, her car ended up spinning out and hitting a utility pole after we hit her. She went to the hospital for minor injuries according to the police report.My friend was trapped in the car because the dash had folded in and pinned his leg to the seat. The fire department ended up using a bottle jack to push it back forward enough to get him out. He also went to the hospital but was only bruised.
Honestly, at the time I wasn't really scared about it at all, so it wasn't unpleasant in that way for me. There also wasn't much pain twords the end so I wasn't in agony either.All of the unpleasent feelings that I felt were mostly from sadness. It really felt like I was going to let everyone down and there wasn't much I could do about it. 
No, I really don't. It was just like I had nodded off and had a very rude, yet much appreciated awakening.
It didn't feel like any time had passed. I had no idea that I had died. I learned it later at the trama center while I was getting my stitches.I actually can't answer if I was groggy or not; honestly I don't think so though. I mean, I was jolted awake and then given shot after shot of adrenaline. They're pretty mean with those shots too. I got one of them right in the chest. After that you're pretty awake haha
That's really interesting. I was actually put under to have my wisdom teeth pulled and I had a dream that I was the dentist pulling them!I'm glad your mom made it through. Being shocked is a super strange experience.
As in "the light at the end of the tunnel" occurrence? No, literally the only way for me to explain it is by attributing it to a dreamless night of sleep.When I woke up I remember being really warm though, which people like to joke about quite often. 
Really? This story comforts me that I won't feel a thing and will not notice dying the same way I can never remember the moment I feel asleep. 
haha it's okay! reading it once is enough.I had gone through the windshield, as I was ejected I had gotten major lacerations to my head, face, and shoulders. I assume the one that was bleeding the most was from above my left eye up to about the top of my head.
Thank you for reading it. I'm also pretty happy to still be here! If not for anything I would hate to think of my friend blaming himself for it.
Mostly bloodloss, I lost an estimated 3 - 4 pints. I also had some minor swelling in my brain and a concussion. Which is probably why I started to lose my motor skills in my hands.
haha something along the lines of "HOLY SHIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED." and then I was confused about the ambulance guy yelling at me and the ambulance girl yelling at him and then I got a lot of shots.I had a chance to think about it later though and I realize that they were probably just communicating with eachother on a play-by-play of what was happening. 
Yeah my memory was fine, I don't vividly remember much of my time in the actual hospital, but I attribute that to the pain medication that I had been given. I don't have any memory problems from it.
I know from the police report that her car had spun out and hit a utility pole on the opposite side of the road and that she had gone to the hospital with minor injuries.
I'm sorry, make sure you pick yourself up a cookie. You've earned it.
Wow, that's terrible. Hearing was the last thing that I remember, I couldn't really hear what was going on around me though. It was more like my body tuned to the sound of my heartbeat.
You are correct, I'm also not a medical professional and I'm not exactly sure of the steps that they took in between heart stopping and defibrillation. I know they did chest compressions, and I assume that there was also some kind of medication in there.The man from the ambulance told me himself how long it had been though, its the only reason I know.
It hurt a lot for about the first 2 minutes. After that I between the shock and Adrenalin none of the pain is particularly memorable.
That and the way the bystanders were looking at me were some of the worst parts of the whole thing. It really felt that it was something that shouldn't be allowed to happen by the laws of nature.
yeah I did get transfusions, but i'm not exactly sure how much I was given. I assume that it was mostly blood loss that brought me to the point I was at. I also had minor brain swelling.
Hopefully most people find it a lot less eventful.
I have a few, there's only one on my face that is noticeable but I took care to Minimize it as much as possible. You have to be pretty up in my face about it in order to see it really clearly. You can feel one pretty well under my hair, and I have a few on my shoulders and neck. Overall, the average person probably doesn't notice too much.
I mean that's the point though. You can return from the brink of death. Death is permanent though. It's semantics I know, but you can't have died and still be living, it violates the definition of the word death.
ahh sorry if that wasn't clear. Yes it was to my mother, I could tell that she was hysterical when she called out to me; so it was a really awful feeling that I couldn't physically reply to her at the time.
you will be in a very controlled environment, I'm sure that everything will work out just fine for you!
Yes I did, and I told her that I had heard her while I was being loaded in the ambulance. She cried a lot and I gave her a thumbs up because I couldn't move enough to hug her. We laughed about how awkward it was.
Yeah I lost about 3 - 4 pints of blood, mostly from my head, neck, and shoulder region. I had a gash that went from above my left eye and up to about the middle of my head. 
diabetes is no joke, make sure you take care of yourself!
yeah sorry, there was one other that asked this same question. I was referring to my mom, I could tell that she was hysterical at the seen of the accident when she called out to me.It really was a shit feeling that I couldn't even get out an "I love you too." the last time that I thought I would see her.
No, I honestly don't at all. 
1. Yes, he got away with very minor injuries. A bruised leg and a bit of whiplash.2. Yes, I had lost a ton of blood. They had a hard time cutting my clothes off because they were heavy from it.3. I had some serious lacerations on my head, neck, and shoulders. my biggest one being from right above my left eye running up to about the middle of my head. second biggest was on my shoulder, about 4 inches across and a quarter of an inch deep. I also had ripped a muscle in my back and compressed a spinal nerve on my right side.4. I was in the road, about 4 feet away from the front of the car.
No, I had my blood donor card with me so they hooked me up to a blood pack right away. They also did chest compressions which from my understanding is to circulate your blood while your heart isn't working.I ended up pretty lucky, I didn't even have broken bones. It was just bunch of really nasty cuts, a torn muscle, and a compressed spinal nerve.
Yeah I had no idea how odd of a thing it was until a person in their residency asked if they could interview me about it for a paper.
She was alright, her and my friend came into the hosptial together. I made a joke about how I still looked better than him. She cried when I told her that I was able to hear her call out to me. I gave her a thumbs up because I couldn't move enough to give her a hug. It was awkard and we all laughed.
Wooo! I'm not so strange afterall!Thanks for what you do!
Thanks, I'm glad that you liked it!
Haha thanks! Hopefully I'm here to stay for a while.
Too Dong Lidn't Read
That's mostly just bad wording on my part. Its more like heart stops --> chest compressions and most likely some kind of medication --> heart tries real hard but can't get it right --> defibrillation.
haha The only really nasty ones are hidden under my hair and the doctors did an especially good job with the stitches on my face. My cuts were pretty clean so they healed nicely.
Actually no I was told that I'm not at any kind of extra risk of a heart attack or anything because of it. My ears would ring on and off for a few days and I would get spots in my vision but that could have also been from any number of things.
In the beginning, before I could actually feel that I was dieing, I had a lot of random thoughts that were just me reflecting on my life, but nothing too crazy. Things that I was happy I had done, I was glad to be single and not have any children at the time.I was in college at the time; English lit. Major and my focus was on children's literature. My only morbid thought was wondering which quote I would want on my gravestone. 
I became really good at talking to suicide survivors.
Not at all, it was like no time had passed. I couldn't feel the chest compressions, and there was no pictures or dreams. I know that a lot of people have those types of experiences and I believe people when they talk about them, but it's not how it was for me.
You're welcome, Thanks for reading it!
Hell yes I did. I've recently answered this twice but its worth saying again.While I was in the hospital I told her that I had heard her call out to me while I was being loaded into the ambulance and that I love her too. It made her cry a lot. My dumb ass gives her a thumbs up because I can't really move. It was so awkward that It made her laugh.
Haha it sucked at the time, but i'm still here and well. I can't complain too much about it.
My mom lost it when I told her that. I was on painkillers and said it pretty matter-of-factly.
"I swear I'm not dying on purpose" 
What was recovery like? Any long term injuries?
*have* you?
did you take advantage of the opportunity and tell them you saw a giant one-eyed cat at the end of the tunnel, and that it was speaking to you in perfectly understandable mathematical equations that explained the nature of the universe and put you as ease and oneness, and that you still harbor this state of mind? And that you can predict events with a 5-second lead?
>I got up and pulled the tube out because I had to pee, and the doctors were super SUPER unhappy about it.I'm a respiratory therapist, and this made me giggle a bit. Sure, you could have damaged your vocal chords, or your throat could have swelled, but most of the time, if you're strong enough to actually stand up, normally you're fine. Don't do that again. <3 
I have no idea how, but it's raining in this stupid office.
I loved the defribillator part, it's incredible how in films we see only the person getting it instead of a first person experience, it would be a cool shot from the director
The dashboard, from the sound of it.
That's an incredible result from such a violent crash. Sounds like if your seatbelt hadn't failed that you would've sustained similar injuries as your friend. Thanks for sharing this and I hope you're doing well, man. 
Hey, I know it's a weird thing to ask, but I was wondering if I could use your story and specifically this comment for some of the suicide prevention stuff I do. If not that's completely fine, but I like to ask my sources.
Being electrocuted while sleeping is pretty rude, but in this case, not as rude as usual 
> being dead will be a weird experienceIt won't be any kind of experience. You'll be dead.
> They're pretty mean with those shots too.Don't mind this large needle, just trying to safe your life.
I guess dying and being brought back to life a weird sensation :pGlad you are doing okay. My friend got in a head on collision with a drunk driver and died so knowing someone like you exist makes me happy :)Hug your friends and family for me
Gone may not be used to describe an actual asystole here. Defibs can absolutely cardiovert specific rhythms back into systole, just that it's not always indicated.
Very strange. Did the experience confirm or change your views on afterlife?
Yep! That was many years ago when I was in high school. It was a very interesting trip, that's for sure. My friends asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital once we were back in the car. I said no, since there probably wasn't really anything they could do except give me some pain medication and maybe an ice pack and charge me a few thousand dollars for it. So far, so good. I've actually been trying to remember what Park it was at because I'd like to do it again (w/O the flip this time). 
Yeah. It was just a mild concussion. Maybe a bit worse than mild, but I'm still alive and haven't noticed any negative effects from the experience, so it probably wasn't THAT bad. 
There's between 8 and 12 pints of blood on average in a body.  You received a ton of blood.   
What did the ambulance guy tell at you?
Thanks, man! Thank you for sharing your story. Also, Drugs are bad. 
I just wanted to say that your matter-of-fact prose is refreshing. This entire thread was worth reading.
You don't know anything about if she faced charges? Considering she killed you and all? 
Thank you. 
He blew half his face all over the garden but I think the bullet probably didn't affect the vital parts for hearing. I hope not, at least that would have comforted him. Either or. 
Most likely they would've done chest compressions and then used the defibrillator when a shockable rhythm was detected. Thanks for sharing, and glad you've recovered well! Very interesting read. 
Very well said. 
Thanks.  Your final thought was not wanting to be rude to your mom.  Not bad.
Geez man. That's some crazy shit. Glad you're alright. Thanks for sharing your story
That's the thing it was my first ever, fucking scary!
That would've sucked! Even just thinking about it. It's so shocking, did you feel as if everything was a dream, as if nothing was hurting , all that was going on was thoughts in your mind?
Haha good spot
That's actually quite valiant. It certainly takes an understanding person to communicate with those that felt that way.I didn't know if you were gonna get my reference or not.
hey man, sometimes they just have to know.
And I'm glad **you're** okay, too!
I'm American so I think that the answer to that question is a "yes" by default.
No, but that would have been amazing. Just yell out "eureka!" as my first word coming back.
Believe me, after the way it felt it's not something I would do again!
Ditto on the smile. What a good feeling he must have had knowing he saved a life. It doesn't always end like this. If only...what a story!!! 
My trapezius
Haha a few years ago I tried to make some easy money painting houses. I quit after 2 days, almost falling off of a 30 foot ladder once is enough for me.I'm glad that you made it too!
r/jesuschristreddit
No I never heard anything else from or about her. I doubt that she even knew the extent of my injuries. My lawyer was able to deal with the court without me being there.
go ahead, I don't mind at all!
I totally know what you mean. I suppose when its time its time, but you should definately fight it every step of the way.
I live with constant pain and had an experience similar to OP though not due to an accident.  It was the first time in years where there was no pain,  I wasn't afraid, I just felt warm, comfortable and relaxed. I felt bad knowing that my mum would be devastated but at the same time I knew everything would be okay.  I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sure her passing was peaceful.  
yeah, I had to let it slide that time.
ahh damn, I didn't even think of that! oh well, somehow I'll cope.
Not like I'd care, I'd be dead anyway ;)
I've had nights where "sleep" was the moment between closing and opening my eyes- felt like an instant but in reality, 10 hours had passed. Makes me wonder how feasible(probably not + likely unethic somehow) artificial comas are for "personal time travel" aka. "wake me up in 2040 when we have flying cars ok bye".
I had an initial surgery, but was told that I'll probably need a secondary one eventually. To be honest, I'm probably past due to have it re-checked.
Thank you, and I will!
This is a good question; I've never been a religious person. I would place myself as Optimistically agnostic. I don't know if theres an actual heaven or hell; but its nice to believe that something happens after we're gone.
yeah in the movies everyone's like "my body feels so cold..." and I'm just like, heh.
Can you explain please? I tried to Google it but I'm still confused...sorry.
What the fuck...why didn't you go to the hospital?! You have no idea what even happened to you..do you? 
Thanks for this, I pretty much just threw it up on the page as I thought about it. I'm just glad to hear it made sense.
I'll keep this in mind. Thanks for letting me know!
Ahh I see your question. No I have no idea, I assume that she was ticketed and all of the basics. But I never heard anything about actual charges.
You're welcome, I'm sorry for your loss and I hope that he went peacefully.
Most of the pain that I can remember having was towards the beginning, after that shock and adrenaline took over. It wasn't so much like a dream, but I was pretty out of it. Think about how it feels to be really groggy after waking up at a bad time. It felt similar to that.
Tears in my eyes and laughter on my lips is an odd roller-coaster.
I feel like this is something out of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
And when they start to say a word or sentence you finish it.
That was my thought exactly. I could have died right then and there and not known. I remember falling. I remember the instant I hit the ground. But I don't remember any pain or anything. Just a skip in time.
Assuming it was at ET tube, that'd be because there's a balloon on the end holding it just below your vocal cords :/
It's like a breath of fresh air :) 
Thank you! I like it <3
Pain can be weird, especially when you're scared or in danger or a lot is happening
I understand, I'm just excited about learning and I know musckles
What was the outcome?
Thank you so much!
 I'm sorry you have to live with that. I hope your momentary lapse in life gave you a sense of comfort in the future and the time that you have left with everyone. I know this moment is changing my perspective on my relationships with my parents. Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot to me right now.
Only this time? You don't want to be woken up by electricity again? I mean, it's definitely gotta get you going 
Just say you saw some angels and you're set doing talks for life. 
oh yeah that too. I almost forgot about that. I've experienced such 'dreamless sleep' before, and it did trip me out. But I most of the time dream vividly, so such sleep is rare to me.As for the 'personal coma', I'd love to do that if we had the tech, but considering how bad humans are at maintaining our civilisation (based on our histories), plus how I don't trust that my sleeping body would be safe from harm, if the tech really does become available, I'd probably not try it out haha
I figure that if no afterlife is the worst case, then death is a pretty good deal. I mean, a dreamless sleep is pretty relaxing. Imagine that, somehow, trillions of years and big bangs down the line, some absurd level of technology finds a way to reignite your consciousness.You might ask for five more minutes. 
The cold feeling is shock, caused by your blood retreating from your extremities. After you heart was restarted, the blood would have flowed back out to them, probably causing the warm feeling.
It is thought that when you die, the brain releases DMT, a powerful psychotropic 
It was just a concussion. There is very, very little doctors can do about them. 
Life happens. You learn to live with it. 
This is probably one of the coolest things I've seen on reddit. Seriously, no hyperbole. Thank you for this. 
Its too bad that she didn't visit you or say she was sorry for causing the accident
I find that these are the best kind of laughter. They don't happen often.
Probably a combination of both. They basically let me go after my blood level almost back to normal. It didn't take me very long to become pretty stable again. 
I want to say that so far I have lived but I'm sure that it's subjective. I mean my life and the way that I've lived may not be truly living life compared to someone else. I dunno
It's the switcheroo. Douglas Adams does that a lot. For example:"It's unpleasantly like being drunk."  "What's unpleasant about being drunk?"  "Go ask a glass of water." 
I once pulled a catheter out(for my wee), not realising it had an air filled balloon keeping it in place :-( nurses were shocked is an understatement
I had all of my medical bills and physical therapy paid for, lawyer took a huge chunk, and I pocketed about $15,000 which I used to pay for a study abroad trip.
You're on to something here. We need to pantent the electric alarm clock. I'm thinking "Shock-Clock" for the product name.
That would be too obvious. Just say you saw a middle-aged chinese woman looking at you disappointedly.THAT'll garner some attention.
"No Power Failures Since ~~1997~~  ~~2048~~ ~~2639~~ 2863!"
This reads like the beginning of a novel, and I want more!
That's actually really interesting to know!
Thank you for explaining, much appreciated. :)
Thank you, very informative and interesting. I read the Wikipedia page but it sounded more like a synthetic drug people take.
Well, I'm glad you're ok...
Thanks, I'm glad that you enjoyed it!
I'd actually imagine that her insurance told her not to contact me directly. My friends insurance told us something similar, not to initiate contact with her. 
Yes!  They always tell me, oh it's my job. And I'm like "I know but I'm really sorry." 
It specifically reminded me of the line:"It's times like this I wish I'd listened to what my mother said.""Why? What did she say?""I don't know, I didn't listen."
My wife is a nurse and has seen that happen. And been shocked. 
Well, cuff is probably a better description, but they inflate like a balloon.If it had a funny oyster looking thing on the end then it was a LMA but those shouldn't hurt nearly as much. Typically we remove them after you've roused enough to open your eyes or support your own breathing with a guadele tube (like a mouth guard with a longer piece to keep your tounge down) and follow instructions, but before you're concious enough to remember.
From the 911 bit I assume you're in the US - I imagine med bills were quite pricey.
I thought that said Shock-Cock...I think that would wake up men fairly well 
TIL God is my landlady
/r/writingprompts! It would be great!
I meant it as purely hypothetical;Besides, we don't have the slightest clue as to how that absurd level of technology would work. At this point, my most educated guess would be that it's magic.I think that, ultimately, the greatest challenge would lie in retrieving information and/or matter from within another big bang, rather than reassembling someone's consciousness.
well it's known that humans and other mammals are able to create DMT, it's very similar to serotonin after all. the problem is that is breaks down quickly and testing it would be done very soon after the person died.
Welcome, I find it extremely interesting. Yes DMT is simply extracted from a number of plants around the world that have a high percentage of the substance. DMT is physically quite safe the only physical effects are dilated pupils, slightly higher heart rate and blood pressure. It's not really possible to overdose when vaping DMT.DMT is also known to help with a number of mental illnesses.
I think you'd be surprised by DMT, as SWIM says it's like you're still completely your self just in another dimension I wouldn't say sleep paralysis would effect it because your not asleep. As long as you go into the trip relaxed as possible, treat the drug like it's not a toy, willing to go anywhere, expectation-less and excited you should be fine.SWIM says after you do it once you'll be a lot more comfortable.
Would that be because of possible grudges and conflicts between you and the girl?

I wasn't 'in the right frame of mind' :-/ actually, I was desperate for a poo too & I think I thought it would help??Plus I'm a girl. Does it make a difference??!
Now we're getting into a new line of products.
No!! i want to use that!!
Oh cool, does that mean that DMT would be very difficult, if not impossible to pick up in a drug test?
That is extremely interesting. Worth reading more into for sure. 
I dunno if it's right for me, considering I have major anxiety though. Maybe after I'm 30 and (hopefully) in a house with my bf. I've logged your advice mentally though so when I am ready to do it, that's what I'll be.
I'm sure that it's a mix of that as well as the fact that insurance doesn't actually want to pay more than they have to. The less the girl knew about my condition the less likely that she would be persuaded to take full blame.Likewise, I wasn't supposed to be in contact with her because It would seem like I was pressuring / harassing her, I suppose.Although, I was the passenger so no matter what I got no blame regardless.
My guess would be that it insinuates guilt 
I think the fact that you're a girl became definitively obvious, was when you said the word "poo". The earlier hint was "pee".  I get it, when in labor, some women poo during the pushing. I made my husband swear not to look, but if he accidentally did, under no circumstances would he tell me if I did, either way. 
Do some men actually like that? It sounds fairly unpleasant 
I actually have one, and it's spectacular.... When it works.
Most psychedelic drugs are impossible to be picked up on drug tests (excluding marijuana of course - which is a psychedelic drug fyi). Shrooms and LSD are unable to be picked up on drug tests. I'm pretty sure DMT is the same. 
There is no rush, it's a crazy experience and no it's not for everyone. It depends on what type of person you're. If you do it end up trying it, start with low dosages and work your way up so you can get a feel if it's right for you.
I see, yeah. It does make sense. Thank you for the story and explaining here!
I really wasn't in labour though!! This was just me, on the loo! As you do!
Rules 36 of the Internet: if it exists, someone has a fetish for it.
Yep the test window is short. The substance occurs naturally in your system anyway 5% of people have detectable amounts in their urine and 45% of people with schizophrenia have detectable amounts.
I had an awkward conversation once where I tried to practice my Mandarin Chinese on this girl from Hong Kong. In my defence she told me she was Chinese, so it wasn't a terrible assumption to make. :)
I like languages, so didn't really think much of it at the time. I guess when you grow up speaking English, you don't really think of other people learning your language as anything other than normal.It definitely feels nice to make someone's day though.
Was it "Ahalay Mahalay"?
Standing at a subway station in toronto I had an asian girl come up to me and just say "Downsview?" to me. I figured she was mainland Chinese and was either unable or far too shy to speak much English.   Handily I spend a lot of time in China for work and have managed to pick up a good deal of basic mandarin. Her eyes lit up when I started explaining to her in shitty mandarin how to get to Downsview station. A mixture of surprise, happiness and total confusion (I'm a big white guy). Glad I could help her out!
Haha, he got fake mad at me when she told him, like 'what have you done?? You're making me look bad'. He messaged me afterwards asking me where I learned though, so I think he has realised how much it would mean to her :).
This is awesome, good job for making random peoples day :D
Just takes practice! Become fluent at the language! The rest will follow!
Aaaaaaaaa that feeling of shared embarrassment
Same. I thought it was going to be a TIFU kinda post until I noticed the sub. 
If they end up in reddit, they usually do. I was also very pleasantly surprised.
...It's not "dobar dan"?
Because Russian is far less obscure than Kazakh. Most people probably know a word or two, so it's more of a hassle. Not that your gesture isn't welcome or anything.
spierdalaj
For those who aren't aware, in Hong Kong they speak Cantonese, not Mandarin
Not just dialects. We have hundreds of full blown languages, and many regional dialects stemming from each of those languages.
Most of India does learn at least some Hindi in school. The only place in India where you can safely expect nobody to know any Hindi is the state of Tamil Nadu, where Hindi is viewed as a linguistic threat to the native language of Tamil.
I've heard it both ways.  "Good on you" is more informal, more slang.
eh, most people speak at least a little, but it's not widespread enough to make the assumption that any given Indian speaks Hindi
I'm reminded of the Mark Twain quote; "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.". 
As someone who's not English, I'll say that learning it doesn't feel anything other than normal :)
It might have been, there's definitely an m sound in the middle and I'm not sure about the ending of the second word. There's only so many times you can ask a person to repeat something haha.
You got lucky haha, I'm surprised you could tell the difference between mainland and Hong Kong / Taiwan 
Haha, it was pretty cool! I grew up in Oregon. West Coast, Best Coast!
How could he learn Kazakh, I wonder... :P
It is really difficult to learn Kazakh. I'm from there originally but never lived there, and I can't find any place to learn it. Since my family is from Almaty, I've been learning Russian instead, but it kind of sucks not to have that connection... 
>k owsr/droptheN?
Thing is, In secondary school we had to choose 2 languages for the first year, and in the second year we dropped one and took the GCSE in the one we kept - We were only offered French, German and Italian at my school though.  So the option is there, but the average 14 year old doesn't really see the point, wheras in other countries I guess there is a whole load of imported media all in english, so there is a lot more motivation to learn it
It's so unfortunate that you get people like that. It almost makes you inclined to just pocket the phone and say you know nothing of it if you knew they'd do that. Did others buy your story over theirs?
I would also usually talk in a radio voice. Making people laugh and question whether or not it was a recording was solid gold. It's one of the very few things I miss about it.
>I wouldn't have thought that Lithuania is particularly interesting or relevant, but because I was able to talk to a Lithuanian about their language and country I found out that their language is the oldest surviving language in Europe, and they have a god damn interesting history.Lithuainia was also (a usually forgotten) half of the greatest power in Eastern Europe for a long while.POLISH-LUTHANIAN COMMONWEALTH STRONK
Not me.  It's either funny (I was born in the same hospital as you) or interesting.  There are far too many sticks up arses nowadays.  Even the Puritans would be confused.
I hate the word cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation promotes understanding and harmony between cultures. It's only bad when done in a way which seeks to stereotype a whole culture in an ignorant way.
That is a good point! 
My mistake, yeah. Cantonese and Mandarin are as different as English and Russian. 
Link for that? That reminds me of a TIFU where a guy adopted his son who was Asian and believed he was Chinese and raised him with that kind of cultural influence only to find out his son was Korean
What does he speak then?
I was unaware that I had a newsletter.  That sounds like a pretty cool thing for me to have.
I thought this was the case for colloquial or conversational Hindi. My understanding was that it is a bit like using French vs. Germanic roots in English: for "high speech" versus "regular talk." I was led to believe that formal Hindi sounds a lot more like Sanskrit, which doesn't sound much like spoken Urdu. Am I wrong?
My dad speaks Malayalam and my mom says it sounds like rocks in a blender. It is an even tumbling sound, because they actually put even stess on all syllables! I'm not sure if this is specific to Malayalam, but speakers also combine the last sound of a word with the first sound of another that has the same letter. It sounds weird when they do it in English.
Languages from different families as well. Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan, Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic.
We're the Texas of India.The CM tried to get rid of teaching  English too a few years ago, but luckily that was quickly shot down.  
No one is expected to know Hindi in India for business. It's English that's important.
Ha bhai Maaf kardo
In this day and age, this can even be sorry if possible through they internet and documentaries, and plenty of media. As long as you don't vegetate in your own little corner of media all the time. Which, unfortunately, a lot of people do.
There was famous soviet magician Amayak Akopyan who had catchphrase "sim-salabim ahalay mahalay". Last part of the phrase can be used to describe some magic action, like word "abracadabra". So I thought this could be the phrase that your colleague used.
I find theres quite a difference actually. The way people look and dress (especially younger people) is way different in taiwan and HK to the mainland imo. Also Taiwanese speak mandarin, so that wouldn't have mattered.   And a  young Hong Konger would almost certainly speak some English.  Call it an educated guess haha.
That's awesome! I'm up in Vancouver BC (west coast = best coast indeed) and now I'll have to see if we have anything like that here!
Plot twist : that's his mother's nickname.
I think he wants to surprise her :)
I disagree. OP did the right thing making this girl feel welcome outside her home country. In a couple seconds he made her feel at home in a way that no one else had done since she had left. Her boyfriend may not have had the idea but at least he's stepping up to the plate in a way that will bring them closer together. If the boyfriend is/was mad then that's on him. OP did the right thing.
Get some beginner Kazakh textbooks and watch Kazakh dramas, will take some effort but you'll be good 
I was with my friend. we both were just really surprised. it was a weird incident. it was also a shitty part of town.
i love when people make boring things fun. you are a cool person.
The douchebag Sweden came along and fucked shit up. Left behind a "cultural desert" in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as I've seen it called. 
I met my wife in my mid 20's. I later found out that although we were born a couple of years apart, she was born in the same hospital. When we were kids, her mother had a job in an office on the same street as where my grandmother lived. There were a few other little coincidences, but those two alone made me go "whoa" when I found it out.
The phrase I used sounded a little like 'kalinz kalai', which apparently is the more formal version
Only spoken, written they are mostly (exactly?) the same. 
From my experience (I'm Cantonese), most Cantonese people can speak Mandarin but not the other way around. In conversation with someone else who speaks Cantonese, whenever I forget a word in Cantonese but know it in Mandarin, the other person would almost always understand if I said it in Mandarin. 
Oh gosh, that. Definitely a reason to do a little more reading before assuming one thing or another. I mean "Kim", hardly a Chinese surname.
He spoke English. I ended up having to help translate things for him. There was a bit of embarrassment on both ends, but he was a pretty okay guy.
it's like catfacts but you're the unwilling one, now TELL ME MORE
Latin did that. Elide the end of a word with the beginning of another. 
Yeps. As far as languages go, if you don't know for a fact, its usually just best to ask which one they speak.
Maybe it's different now, but from what I've heard from family and friends, Hindi is a necessary part of getting a good job in India.
Chalo maaf kiya. :)
I didn't wanna get into a whole long essay, but yeah, I don't think it has to be *literal* travel, with the options available these days. 
That's probably the guy! I'll update my story in future retellings :-)
Yes, Hongkies will mostly likely already know some English.Source: a fellow Hongki.
Ooh, I love Vancouver!! So gorgeous.
I don't think he did anything bad as such, just that his friend might be a little irritated about it. Like maybe OP should be a little careful about making other grand gestures or talking to her alone for at least a short time just so his friend doesn't get a wrong idea.It seems like everyone overall is reacting positively though so I doubt it's that big a concern.
It was a gas, man. One of my favorite lines was "Wwwwwwelcome to the best [insert fast food restaurant] in [insert town]!" The kicker was that this was the only one of this chain in town, so some people would be like "Hey, wait! This is the only X in town!"
Yep, right :)
Hong Kong uses traditional characters while mainland China uses simplified, but yeah. The characters represent concepts rather than sounds. Japan also uses a bunch of the characters in combination with their own alphabets.In fact, if you put a Mandarin speaker, a Cantonese speaker and a Japanese speaker into a room, even if none of them speak any of the other languages they can communicate through writing characters for each other. It's a fascinating system.
IIRC the surname was Park
It has always been different. Perhaps the people you know are from North India. Most people there are mostly ignorant about South India.
Dhanyaavaad. India may he rehte hai ya bahar?
Although literal travel is probably still the best way to force open mindedness, because to seek out this stuff kind of requires some from the get go.
Is that really what people from hong kong are called in English? 
See! you are a cool guy! what do you do now, if you dont mind?
The Japanese person would have difficulties though, as grammar isn't as similar and they wouldn't be able to use their Japanese characters, which are about half of what is typically written (in terms of information, not by character. By character it's more than half. Kanji is more information dense than hiragana or katakana.)
I knew it one of the super common equivalent-of-"Smith"-in-western countries names, I forgot which one but i remember it was distintly Korean
Bharat mein hi hoon aur ek-do saal.
No, I made it up myself. I think Hong Kongers is the preferred term. I think Hongkies sounds catchy though, even though it somewhat coincide with a Texan slang or something.
I work for Delta now, doing plane stuff. How about yourself?
Even in Japan, different regions use kanji slightly different.For instance (and don't quote me on this because it has been 6-7 years since I lived there) the kanji symbol for napkin on mainland is the symbol for toilet paper on some of the islands.   
Even for native people it's hard. I'm ethically Chinese, but I live in Singapore. I can speak Chinese just fine but my writing... It wouldn't be exaggerating to say a 12 year old kid could write better. I really only know the basic words and then some. 
It's not totally disconnected, though. For about 80% of words, you can guess the pronunciation with some degree of accuracy if you know the most common character parts, which aren't that many (about a few hundred). Granted, this degree of accuracy usually means that there is some ambiguity in both the aspiration of the consonant and the tone of the word.
Those phonetic characters are  also used in Mandarin, and are also used to convey the tone of the sentence. The difference in written Cantonese and Mandarin are the specific phrases used to describe an object or concept. I don't have any immediate examples to give but an object like toilet can have different combinations for both, but would still be legible for both languages, although they would sound strange to the other side because they don't usually call the thing that way.   Note: I probably butchered the English language by typing that, English is not my first language.
It sounds like honky, which is a derogatory(ish) word for white people.
ooooo plane stuff! I'm an engineering student. I just wrote my last final for the semester. Exciting side news: I'm starting my first junior engineering job on Monday!
You seem like a fairly shrewd person and in addition also interested in learning other cultures. How did you think referencing Borat is funny or relevant in any other way still?
I'd say I'm ethically Chinese as well, but I live in Canada. 
I'm talking about words that don't exist in Mandarin. The easiest example is also one of the most basic. The word "to be" or hai in Cantonese has no Mandarin counterpart. While the word "to be" or shi in Mandarin does have a counterpart in Cantonese.Note, hai in Cantonese is a character written for its sound, not its meaning. 
Engineering job?! Fat wallet swingin' :DGood job getting through that, man, it must've been tough. What do you engineer?
I didn't reference it.  She did, as what i imagine was a self deprecating way of breaking the ice. 
I was thinking 'Oh yea the PSLE, just took that a while ago. Didn't do too bad, least I passsed.. Oh wait that was the 'O' Levels'.Fuck me time flies.
puns are actually common as most characters sounds the same when read/pronounced.
ha! i am looking for a car on the internet, and it feels like my bank account is waaay too tiny. I cant wait for a nice big paycheck, and for my student loan to wither and die.Thanks! I engineer systems. I am in industrial engineering. LEAN six/ process design. Yadda yadda yadda.what do you mean by 'plane stuff'? that must be cool.i may be over thinking this, but you type a lot like a friend from school. I think he would recognize my username, though.
Calm down, Gandhi. 
Also because they can convice voters to vote for them. Regardless of your ideas, you also need to be able to communicate them in such way that the people want you. You need to be good at the political game, which is not just about different opinions but also about making alliances and enemies at the right times with the right people. I think many geniuses have trouble communicating to the "normal" people, so they could never become president. The charisma just isn't there. Let alone that they could dive into the political game.
Citizens of America, gingivitis has been eroding the gums of our nation for too long.
What do you mean, "I couldn't be the president of the United States of America"?Tell me something, it's still "We the people", right?
Your letting us down cactus!  But I expect to see your name on the ballot next time.

FLAVA FLAAAAAAAAAVE
I'd like to see Jon Snow give it a shot
I'd give Obama a third term over current two options. 
*cries softly into pillow alone at night* Bernie...
The problem in this election is that the two mainstream candidates are not equally bad.  I dislike Hillary and do not want her to be president, but I think Trump would be an indescribable disaster.  Hildog will have to have a *very* secure lead in the polls before I'll even consider voting 3^(rd) party.Also, dunno any specifics about Gary Johnson, but the Libertarian party has its own streak of batshit crazy positions that turn many people off.
Seriously.  Hillary absolutely has the resume for the job, if not the charisma.
It's a cruel winter out here
Close, but you have to be 35 to be president.
I got 142 mil from a census... so something in the range of these numbers
She's actually a figure head for someone else.
The executive branch employs over 10 million people. It's decidedly more powerful and larger than the legislative branch, despite only a single individual being elected to run the branch. It no longer resembles what the Constitution proscribed. 
As much as I hate to say it, I agree with this line of thinking. "Meh. I know she'll use the opportunity to line her own pockets but at least she won't wreck the place. And who knows, she might end up throwing us a couple of bones while she's at it."
Right, because these days it's almost certain that a person would be ousted for thinking and acting differently outside the common and accepted norm; especially if they're ideals challenge the status quo; which revolutionary and advanced thinkers always do.
Its Dr. Sagan.
Well of course. But giving people free speech and free press and the right to practice any religion they wanted and attempting to keep religion out of government was ridiculously progressive for 1776.  
Nahhh, I'm more of a Cyrus the Great kind of guy.

Nah, Hillary is definitely the Frank of the equation.
You're right, we should just choose the person with the most dragons.
I think Me has all the appropriate qualifications. Me's foreign policy is unmatched. 
I feel like these candidates are so terrible, it forces you to vote *against* the other candidates, no matter what your personal beliefs. Not for some important issue, not for some goal or promised progress. It's bullshit.
I dunno man/woman - I doubt Hillary will invade a sovereign nation and occupy it for the rest of her presidency on not the best intelligence.I'm sure I'll get a million replies about her vote for the Iraq war; I think that's made her incredibly weary to intelligence.  God I fucking hope so!
With Trump running, he doesnt have to ask.
Yeah that we post pass-aggressive, snarky 1 liners to twats on Reddit?
We have real numbers against Hillary, and he lost.
I think somewhere there's an article saying a decent amount of Americans would consider it right now. 
_howls loudly at the top of my lungs from forlorn moonlit cliffs at night_ Berrrrrnieeeeee!\*sobs\*
Damnnnnn, imagine that after where it is now, Bernie somehow wins against all odds. And then it's his inauguration he looks like the nice old man we know, gets up to do his speech, comes to the mic and says "hail Hydra"
He never said or implied anything of the such. I'm sorry to hear that's the impression you got. 
He's pro private prisons. 
\#FeelTheJohnson
Or Jimmy Rollins. He's a free agent right now, you know.
Sounds like a Trump voter 
My issue with her is she is a criminal and probably going to get away with it because of her last name and money.

Not necessarily, you just need connections capable of delivering a billion dollars. And an effective campaign manager who can put together teams in important states. At this point the campaign is already under way for 2020, I'm sure aspiring candidates are already talking to high level campaign operatives and establishing donor networks from the ashes of this year's bids.

"We've automatically upgraded your citizenship to Citizienship Pro. If you decline the agreement, you will be reverted back to regular citizenship" (and have a slight chance at having to go through a re-citizenship process should the rollback not go well) :p
> Very true. Also kind of hard to influence him with more money.> One could make that same argument about Trump.  One shouldn't, however.  I had an argument with a friend a decade ago that I never forgot.  I had mentioned that an IQ test should be a requirement to serve public office.  He pointed out that this is extremely flawed reasoning; there are plenty of highly intelligent people in office who act maliciously.  Instead we should test their EQ, or empathy quotient.  We should test their ability to assess the needs of their fellow citizens and care for them.
Senator Corgi let me pet his tummy! And he let me vacuum him to get his extra fur off because he sheds so much that it's just easier than brushing and who are you to judge huh?  So, in conclusion, put me down for 2 tickets. What's on the menu? It better be fancy feast for prices like that...
What about You. I heard he's got great charisma and ideas
This is why I think Trump and Clinton have a sort of co-dependence. The only chance they have at winning is if they're running against the other person.
Regardless of whether you like or dislike him he's certainly the most impactful president in recent memory, all while dealing with the most batshit retarded Congress in history.
Don't talk about change, just do it!
I mean, I would think that if we could all opt for another 4 years of Obama over Trump and Hilary we would. But I also thought that people weren't absolutely retarded enough for these to be our two choices to begin with.
Or if she gets information that could prevent something on the same scale as 9/11 I'm sure she would. 
I'm voting Trump. 
It is an unending source of bafflement to me that, after arguably the most capable president the US has ever had died during his 4th term in office, our nation collectively went "nah, we don't want anyone that capable in office that long again, we'd rather just be screwed". Like, what in the living fuck, guys?!
I'd vote for her over either of them too.
If you think Hillary is going to give a third Obama term you're gonna have a bad time. 
*places a single white rose atop a gravestone marked "uncounted Provisional Ballots 2K16"* ...Bernie...
He supports abolishing all and any federal agencies that he is allowed to. EPA, NIH, Department of Education, etc. Abolish them all. That alone is enough to tell you he's a completely impractical candidate who has vested to much faith in the "free market."
And against Net Neutrality. 
Instructions unclear: In voting booth playing with self.
Nah we just lock him in the Ambrose Asylum if he goes rogue.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it. I should probably be really scared by that. It's exactly what we criticize many Trump voters for. I'd like to think I wouldn't vote for charisma over qualifications, but if push comes to shove, what would I do? Would I vote for Rollins over some theoretical sane, moderate member of the "opposing party"? Of course I'd like to think not - but could Rollins convince me otherwise? Hell, I just don't know.
Trump is also a serious swindler. He has a history of ripping people off and making poor investment decisions. 
Yeah.  Musk's plan is to gtfo and settle Mars.  300 yrs from now the martians will come back and take over Earth by sitting in space with an asteroid precariously orbiting Earth.  They'll probably have gundams too.   
Any government system will eventually have that flaw as it gets more corrupt, democracy just puts the blame on people, oligarchy puts the blame on the powerful directly. If anything, one of the main flaws of democracy is believing that it works and when it doesn't it's because they voted the wrong politician.Americans might have preferred Hillary over Sanders or Trump over pretty much anyone else, but it was the establishment who put so little work in preventing this.
And I'm starting my computer and a new game of civ
We're living that in the present.  It's a trick of theirs that we don't realize it.  Median income for an American family of four (household) is $50K.

You're right. His actual net worth is definitely up for debate, but the point I'm trying to make is that he's definitely not poor, you know?
I don't know. I told her not to do anything illegal. Let's just assume she didn't. Also, a one-word response: tindr.
See, I'm happy with the free pony, but the part I feel like people keep forgetting is that it's a mandatory national identification pony. Like, what if I want to go visit someone in another state? Do I have to ride the pony there instead of flying? How fast can a pony walk, anyway? And would it be illegal to tamper with my pony? Because it might be worth it if I could at least add racing stripes.
But it better work this time :(
It would be fairly pointless to elect someone who wanted to do a good job but can't actually get the job done.
Why not a Me/You ticket? Me for prez, with You for VP.
He even speaks Esperanto!
Conspiracy theory time!  Trump is a ringer to give Hilary the presidency.  He takes out all of the Republican competition, then makes the rest of the country hate him so they vote Clunton.  There's no other way in hell that would make me vote for her, but come November, I probably will.
If only someone warned us about this sort of thing...
He's very nuanced, professional and good at what he does. He understands the world and his impact. I'm Belgian and I'm gonna miss him man
Who actually know what went on behind the scenes to put that together though. I feel as though lobbyists are more to blame than obama himself, iirc obama wanted single-payer or at least a government option
That's the biggest issue though. A motivated population is one of the scariest things that a government can imagine. But a motivated population is virtually impossible to have.
Have you looked at what happens in parts of government that don't have a term limit?
You might dislike her as a person, but aren't they both pretty much what you expect from people representing the Democratic party, as far as policy goes?
Ah. Okay, nevermind then. Knew this sounded a little too good to be true for a Libertarian nominee. 
Libertarianism is astrology for men.
Will still produce more useful results than voting for Hillary or Trump.
We'll just keep the Lesnar launch codes under wrap out in Canada.
Seriously. Just because he's not politically shady doesn't mean he's not shady. He's just corrupt in another industry. How is that better?
See you in 14 hours.
I mean sure, now's pretty awful for a lot of people..but we haven't evolved into birds that are scared of the ground after the entire world turns into shoeshops, so we have that going for us.
Yeah, I don't disagree.  I guess I don't want to get all philosophical, but as you say, I suspect that old lady is just a bitch.
You say that like it's a bad thing. Older houses kick ass assuming they were nice houses to begin with.
I can dig it. The point I was kind of getting at is that his own personal wealth isn't actually funding his campaign, sort of.He is lending his own personal money to his campaign, which means any money he fund raises, he can pay himself pay everything he put into the campaign.So he gets the PR shit from being able to talk about how rich he is and how he is paying for his campaign, while at the same time, not actually paying a penny to it, because everything his official campaign fundraises he pays back to himself.
PEACE SELLS!
What if Clinton is a ringer to give Trump the presidency? She gets the Dem nomination, lies every time she speaks, and pretends she isn't a corrupt piece of shit so people vote for Trump. 
Get out of here with that sane rational thinking, don't you know you're on reddit!
Yeah, like, if only our very first president warned us about something like this in his farewell speech...
Me too Belgian... me too. 
That was actually a semi-obscure youtube reference, but yes, I agree :P
Not at all.  If you look at things she was say at the beginning and prior to her campaign versus what she's saying now,  she's pulled a complete 180 on many big issues.  She's pandering for votes,  which to me means once she gets into office she's going to flip again. Changing your mind on issues based on new information is one thing.   Flipping on most major issues after you start slipping in the polls is another. 
I have some libertarian beliefs but I think any libertarian candidate would be absolutely disastrous as president.
So I keep hearing. And then, after considered discussion, those liberal progressive values seem to wither and die. And if I point out elected libertarians and how they hide their racism behind a shield of political neutrality, one by one I get told "that's not a REAL libertarian." Yeah, they seem to be legendary creatures like unicorns; oft spoken of but never seen.
And yet, the dueling ideologies often produce the same results.Conservatives once openly defended "NO BLACKS ALLOWED signs" as they were very happy with racial segregation and racism. Now, Libertarians aren't screaming anyone should be racist -but their ideology permits the same signs. One just might suspect they found an alternate way to get the same things done. I see them as conservatives in sheep's clothing.
My argument is that it is and always was a non-issue, it's being blown up purely to harm her chances at getting elected.  Do you honestly think anybody actually gives a shit about email servers?  Of course not, which is why every other SecState did whatever the fuck they wanted with them.It was never a 'crime' until republicans decided to call it one.
14? Do you play on Quick speed? ScrublordGit Gud then come back.
Which is nice.
I'm from the UK and a basically just want to bring this back to use on George Osborne. :)
Yes and no. Really old houses are beautiful, but they're also going to require a lot of maintenance due to their age and the inevitable wear and tear on them. Not to mention they were probably built with absolutely zero concern about energy efficiency, so heating and cooling them will be a lot more expensive if you don't drop a bunch of cash to retrofit them.And the majority of old houses aren't even those beautiful, ornate ones - they're cookie-cutter boxes built for GIs after WWII, and they were built to be mass-produced, not to last for a hundred years.
But who's buying?
Eh, Clinton is definitely a serious candidate, to the same extent that Sanders is. She was solidly in second place against Obama eight years ago, she's been involved in politics for decades and has held elected office as well as appointed positions, etc. Her life history shows that she is passionate about being in politics, so I don't think it's likely that she isn't sincerely interested in becoming President.
If he would've warned about getting involved in international affairs as well... almost seems like we could learn something from him
A government for the people of the people by  the people, eagle?
Well, at least we voted for them
>she's pulled a complete 180 on many big issues.Which ones? Her policy ideas have been pretty progressive, and include things that many other candidates never talk about (child care, for one).
Saw it on Twitter
Hogan's the one with the guns though...
National security is a non-issue? But okay, I'll humor you. Let's for a minute pretend that the only reason the emails are being blown up like this, is because of the GOP and the upcoming election.Does this suddenly invalidate the fact that she did something wrong? No. Of course not. I don't care if every Secretary of State,  Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and Attorney General did it too. It doesn't make it acceptable if it poses a legitimate security risk.The fact that she's deleting records and hiding shit about them is just the cherry on top.
Marathon mode, I'll return during the next election. 
I actually read that at the end of /u/TheCommieDuck 's comment even without seeing yours.I guess memes are in my blood now.
That's exactly why Ostracism wasn't very successful late into democratic Athens' lifetime. People ostracised people whose policies they didn't like rather than, the intended targets, threats to the democracy.
Nah, I get too much prompting right out my own head.  ;)
PEACE SELLS
I think Lleu has confused Clinton with Trump. Clinton's policies have changed significantly over decades but have been consistent for many years now and she's been consistent in her ideologies and policies.
If you delve deep enough, you can always find that everybody 'did something wrong'.  What matters to me is what it says about her character.  To me, this wasn't a character-damning indiscretion, like bribery or corruption.  This was her getting around the pain in the ass protocol surrounding email rules.You have to pick the hills you're willing to die on, you know?  I know, personally, I dont give a fuck about what servers emails are stored on.
I'm not going to lie, I pretty much would just use it out of spite or because I thought it would be funny. 
from time to time and place to place. That's true, but still we gain those advantages by having federal parties, we also are given free broadcast time on the CBC / BBC to air our beliefs and such.In the US there are no legal systems for political parties except some basic financial laws which are filled with loopholes. 
It would be hilarious if we could specify where the target has to live those 10 years. Send Trump to live in Tijuana. Send Salvini (head of the northern league) to live in Naples.
It came out steaming hot and it was a light brown (I think it's actually a caramel/vanilla flavor), so it didn't occur to me it might not be coffee.
Best thing I've read today too. As a white, coffee drinker.
Drinking straight creamer? More like freshman 150.
> God help you, have my upvote. I laughed out loud, :D> and then read this to my boyfriend.:(
Huh, I started with black tea (no additions), transitioned to shitty coffee drunk black, now consume great freshly burr ground coffee with a little milk to cool it down in the morning, a 200mg pill at noon, another cup drunk black after getting home, a latte in the late evening, and a 3 bag kettle of green tea at night. Fuck.
Or if you're like me and never liked caramel, the mocha frappuccino is the same thing but with chocolate instead. It's pretty much a frozen chocolate drink with whipped cream and with a coffee undertone.
I figured stuff at the cafeteria probably wouldn't be the best, but I could get it free on my meal plan as opposed to dropping $2-3 for every cup. Such is life as a student
Usually when someone asks me how I take my coffee I say "black and bitter, like my soul". I think I'll switch to this. 
No, but after reading the comments I'm thinking I should give it a go
This! I've been a daily coffee drinker since I was 12 (now 29) and for a long time, I drank dark roasts exclusively. A couple years ago, I heard that lighter roasts have more caffeine, so I decided to give them a try, and as it turns out, I actually prefer the taste. They aren't just for noobz.
Heh after reading this my first thought was "man I'd make this guy the best french press coffee"  There will be a day when we just crush the beans and snort them.
I started my freshman year and found myself enjoying it, but eventually realized it was giving me anxiety attacks and stomach problems (my stomach is fragile in the morning). But I still love the taste of it. So now I'm a weirdo who drinks decaff coffee to keep my nerves at bay, at night, when my stomach can handle it.
> I took my first ever sip of coffee this year at the age of 21 which only assured me of my decision to never drink any more coffee.I had my first hamburger at 21, and from then on I knew ground beef wasn't for me.Seriously though, the popularity of coffee as a utilitarian means of providing caffeine means that you really have to look to find good coffee. Starbucks and Folgers don't do coffee justice any more than McDonalds and Burgerking should impact your standard for beef.
The search continues. I had a cafe au lait yesterday and it wasn't the most terrible thing ever. Next time I go, I think I'll get a latte.
The smell keeps me from trying it enough that I've never gotten around to forcing myself to taste it at all.
I'll probably be trying something along those lines next time I go.
Hopefully not. I don't want to become dependent on it. I just want to not mind it.
Haha thanks. Glad you liked it
Not even sure where the nearest Starbucks is. There's a cafe that's popular with the locals and has several locations on campus. I've been getting about one coffee a week for the past few weeks. I've mostly tried different types of drip coffee. Haven't really found anything that clicks yet.
It was a light brown and I think it's a vanilla/caramel flavor. I haven't had much exposure to coffee, so I just thought a little cream added could make it that color.
Creamers unite
you gotta try Wawa coffee if you're ever near one
As delicious as it is, I don't want to get fat, so probably. :/ Maybe I'll every once in a while for old times' sake.
Glad you enjoyed it.
I might do that next time I grab something. I've tried dark/full city roasts so far, but I don't think I've tried a light roast.
Don't know how I would notice since I don't have access to a scale. Are you talking about my username that's relevant?
I've tried medium/dark roasts, so I'm thinking next time I want to try something lighter.
I actually emailed them a couple days ago, so we'll see if they write back. Some people are theorizing it's not actually creamer, but idk.
I did get some really bad headaches, I just wasn't sure if it was due to other factors. I'll look into it.
Not a fan of grapefruit, haven't really had the others (except mushrooms, which I like). You're the second person that's posted about that, so maybe I should look into it a bit more.
Yeah, I realize. One of the reasons I've mostly been trying drip coffee is because there's little/no calories. I'll definitely have to hit the gym more than usual this week.
This past week was my first week not counting calories after 2 months of diligent tracking, so I'd be scared to find out. Probably more than 10.
I agree with the other user, if it was steaming hot and light brown I would highly doubt it was coffee creamer. Sounds to me like you were drinking a French vanilla cappuccino.
It might be cappuccino, actually.  It comes out of a machine that you press a button and hold your cup under?  And it's hot and frothy?
Best thing I've read today, as a white black coffee drinker. 
Good coffee is like good whiskey. Doesn't need any frills; it's perfect as is.
**I LIKE MY COFFEE LIKE I LIKE MY WOMEN**
If you *ever* have the chance, Jamaican. Blue. Mountain.  Sooooo fucking good.  It's how I learned to drink straight black coffee.  I got *really* lucky and was able to drink super fresh fresh Jamaican Blue Mountain for about three weeks, and it was fucking amazing, and turned me into a black coffee lover.
Because I wanted him to laugh too!
i used to drink tea but i've been unable since moving to coffee! any recommendations? drink strong and black coffee fairly regularly at the moment
That sounds so sweet my teeth hurt just reading it.
"never like caramel"Erm...wut?  How is that like, even a thing?
I think the frap gave you a heart attack. It's diabetes in a cup. Im a barista at a small shop and we have like one blended drink that we have for those new to coffee but man, espresso is so good. It's like what the guy above said,  it's like whiskey.
I think this is similar to how a lot of people get into beer. You get over that "gross" flavor of beer by drinking light stuff like Miller, Coors, etc. then you start to get introduced to craft beer and it's like a whole new world. 
Yeah, I quit dairy recently but lattes were totally my gateway drug
I've been experimenting with aeropress, frenchpress, and the chemex to find my perfect coffee experience. It gets addicting (lol) and you realize you've become the coffee equivalent of a wine snob.But ironically, when I'm late for work, half asleep, and in a rush, I actually make coffee out of the keurig.
I don't find dark chocolate bitter. I just don't really like the taste really...
I only found out about a year ago after years of just drinking whatever.  My friend started getting way into buying fresh beans online and roasting them at home himself.  So, I first got to try freshly (lightly) roasted Ethiopian coffee... almost tastes like a kind of intense tea.  So amazing.  I now get the freshly roasted beans at Sprouts (North American whole foods type store) and grind them coarsely there and French press at home.  Ever since, almost any dark roast just tastes like garbage... what do you drink?
The coffee in the water is turning the fucking frogs gay!
Same! All I need is a good sleep and I'm good for the day. Even the smell of coffee makes me wrinkle my nose... I find it strange that some people force themselves to like it.
I understand that, my real point is why voluntarily get yourself addicted to caffeine when you have gone so long without it?I get that there are worse addictions out there and that we are all "addicted" to something in some form or another, but why add on another addiction voluntarily?Same reason why I don't drink or use other substances like marijuana. I can live a perfectly happy live without all of those things, like many other people can. Wanting to add another addiction cannot be a good thing, right?
We used to serve at the coffee shop I worked at in high school drink called moo moo mr. cow, half a packet of instant hot chocolate in coffee.
One trick is to ask for a "single shot latte". In my country at least, every coffee is a double unless you ask for a single.To my mind the point of latte/ cafe con leche/ cafe au lait is that it is supposed to be weak and milky.
Yea lol it must be. Maybe I'll give it some more chances and see if i can ever acquire it, but it def feels forced to drink it atm
I have an extra bitter gene so I have never found a coffee I like, I love the smell, hate the taste, Thankfully there is tea
Lighter roasts are much less bitter but they tend to have a little more caffeine. The flavor is also much more versatile with other flavors, like that delicious French Vanilla Supreme.
Aggies are known for being dumb... so yes. 
Ah, okay.I'm a dark roast fan, medium roast reminds me of nasty school coffee, even if I tell myself its good stuff.
Could be. Doesn't taste anything like coffee though.
Yeah. It doesn't taste like coffee at all though. Upon further tasting, the subtle undertone I thought was the coffee is actually caramel. I've got a hell of a refined palate.
And they're both an acquired taste.
Yep, there can be a *world* of difference in coffees.  Best coffee I've ever had was on a ship in the Galapagos. Smooth, flavorful, just fantastic.
I just eat straight dirt. Most plants come from dirt and I get mine from the source.
I usually will add a little bit of cold water to mine. I started doing it because that's how it works with an Aeropress: you make a concentrate then add hot water. One day I got tired of waiting 20 mins to drink it, so I left a little bit of room for cold water. Instant perfect temperature coffee, been doing that ever since - even to non-Aeropress coffee.
Pretty sure there are some, but its sub-20 calories. I think its like 5 calories for a cup of coffee. Its so low mostly because its just water.
12 years old and mixed up with coke? Ground up and in the freezer?
Unfortunately most JBM is utter crap that is poorly grown and overpriced because of name alone.
Interestingly I hear lots of girls saying this (not that i know princesshashbrown's true gender) Apparently dudes can't refuse milk+sugar in any form though. 
Just switch to soy or almond! Just as good. 
Have you tried the Ghirardelli 86%? It almost defeats the purpose of buying very dark chocolate so you don't eat too much at a time.
You can live a perfectly happy life without many many pleasurable things, that's not reason to deny yourself. BTW you don't have to be addicted to coffee to enjoy it lol
I don't want to force it into my daily routine, I just want to be able to go along if people are grabbing coffee. I'll give tea a try next time I'm out.
Yeah it's a fake mix out of those machines, like you'd get at the gas station.  Not real coffee, kinda like hot chocolate.
Those flavored cappuccinos don't really taste like coffee.  They're very very sweet.  It just seems very unlike that what you've been drinking is creamer, if it's coming out of a dispenser hot.
Worst thing for me, as just a drinker.
You haven't had good coffee. There is usually no bitterness at all.
I wish I had enough passion for something to go that hard core with it. 
If you have a Stumptown coffee roasters near you, they're really good. /r/coffee can also assist you in picking a good coffeemaker 
Then start eating dark chocolate! :)
I'm a girl, and I don't like caramel. I do, however, love hash browns! :) I really don't understand why I don't like caramel because it *seems* good in theory, but I don't like the flavor and texture.
I love bubble tea with bubbles or coconut jelly!
I did but I'm also poor and black coffee's just...better anyways. Most of the time, at least
Lindt 90% is worse (and by worse I mean so much more delicious.) I started buying dark chocolate to lower my chocolate intake.. It worked for awhile and then I just got used to it. On the bright side, there's less sugar (so it's "better for you") and no one eats it on me because everyone else thinks it tastes like dirt.
I completely forgot about the social aspect. My own biased perception of caffeine after getting off of soda after 12 years has morphed my view of soda, coffee, and alcohol from being something that can be enjoyed casually to something that will inevitably lead to addiction.That is an ignorant view as many people have more self control in that aspect.
Im sure all you will need is one cup to decide it too. Honestly, cold brew coffee is the fucking shit. A lot of coffee shops really mess it up though. Its very low in acidity and bitterness. You have to drink it black though, or else you might as well not spend the money on it. Cold brew is similar to ice coffee in the way that they are both coffee and ice. Thats the only similarity though. Cold brew will forever be better
And most people mix it with coffee
I have had some digestive troubles, but it's hard to know if my "coffee" was the cause.
I did the same (had some leftovers in a thermos in my fridge) and now realize how it's way too thick/sweet. I was just deluded by the fact I had found coffee that didn't taste so nasty and bitter that I didn't see it for what it really was.
This, just like how cinnamon toast tastes nothing like Big Red gum (which is flavored like pure cinnamon), cappuccinos taste nothing like black coffee.
#allcoffeecolorsmatter 
Petes Coffee bought Stumptown and Intelligentsia so I don't know how long the quality will last, I myself have never liked it. Some shops across the US will deliver online and to other states. A big chain that's actually really good is Blue Bottle coffee, it's great. I'd always prefer to look for smaller, local roasters, they tend to serve what the local likes.
I really like that already, so hopefully that gives me some sort of advantage.
 I like caramel but I don't like caramel flavored things, like Frappuccinos.
I tried it with jelly, still don't like it lol
My parents were both alcoholics, so I became biased against such things as well. That's why I'm only now considering the possibility that there might be something worthwhile in there besides drunkenness. It's always a pleasure to meet someone with such an open mind, though!
Fake cappaccino is gross but mixed with black coffee makes it pretty good IMO
It would be more likely to be real coffee if the digestive troubles are correlating with your ingestion of the mystery drink. Caffeine helps with GI motility (although if you're experiencing more of a constipating effect, it's more likely the dairy in the drink). Also with the headaches, those could very well be from caffeine or caffeine withdrawal.
I totally get that. The stuff my parents used to keep around tasted like dirt.If you still want to try coffee, I'd suggest a flavored medium roast, cold brewed (put the grounds in a pitcher of water for 24 hours, and store refrigerated after filtering).Cold brewing cuts out a ton of the bitterness to the point that I usually don't sweeten mine at all.
*sips glittercoffee*
Sugar sugar sugar. Sugar and videogames are why America is fat. We are sedentary Coca Cola and low-fat ice cream addicts.
Take eggplant. Say you try it for the first time and you don't like it. If, over the next few years, your SO every once in a while offers you a bite of his/her eggplant, you accept just for the hell of it, and eventually start liking it, that's natural and fine. But if, as some other redditors have said in their responses to me (particularly with cofffee), you purposely keep eating it and despising it just because you think that you may eventually come out the other side and like it, that's insane.
I feel you there - I absolutely hate beer. Might be to do with my starting to drink a few years later than my friends; we went to the same house parties at 16 with alcohol, I just didn't start drinking it till later. Not a fan of wine either; for me it's shots or cocktails (can't beat a double screwdriver or sex on the beach), mainly due to the former being efficient enough to disregard taste as well as down quickly enough, and the latter tasting nice enough to enjoy. Toffee vodka is also great. 
While Stumptown is now owned by Peet's, the people who make Stimptown what it is are going to remain in control, so quality shouldnt change. It would likt he article that I learned that, but I am at work and Sprudge is blocked, but Reddit isnt, lucky me.
Agreed, caramel is amazing but anything that's supposed to taste like it has this weird burned, bitter, and/or artificial taste to me.
Her username
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. I hope your tomorrow is extra awesome :)
I'm more of a Waffle House hash brown type. If I'm at McDonalds, I get the two that come with the breakfast combos at normal breakfast time.
Hey, we can't all like everything!
Drinking pure creamer, which is 50% lipid, also causes digestive troubles. Your liver does not normally produce bile to handle drinking the equivalent of an entire cup of fat in one go, especially every day for several days - this is literally something people do to deal with constipation.
"Cappuccino"
But that is just what an acquired taste is. 
Yeah, but in any normal situation people know when to stop and just say "this isn't for me." 
I want to believe this to be true but only time can tell. I was never a huge fan of stumptown but they did a good job of reaching to the public. Here in LA's Westside there's Cafe Luxxe and they're doing great for the general health of smaller coffee stops. Long Beach is striving as well, and there were rumors of starbucks gms calling my shop for tips and training. I think small coffee is going to take over. But tangent aside, blue bottle is a company that's grown dramatically and still remains top dog in most places.
What album?
I generally fast-forward to the hot naked people
I have given this topic some thought over the day and I actually came to agree with your point as in the end I found it intellectually dishonest to believe that reading is an aquired taste (and thus that such a concept exist) while food can't be. Maybe I will try to go black with coffee in the coming weeks. I have just never considered food as more than a means to an end.
^   Emphasis on what this guy said.
There are hundreds of condiments that don't hurt you.
The Prodigy's *Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned* was like that for me. I didn't enjoy it the first listen, but it really grew on me with time.
I am fine watching just for laughs gags hidden camera show, it rarely embarasses the random person.  It is usually just them seeing something crazy happen.  But I won't watch roasts or shows like punk'd where the idea is to embarass the victim.
I think one difference between Arrested and The Office is the only sane person in Arrested knows everyone around him is crazy, while the Office has several "normal" people trying to grapple with the oddballs on the show and keep some level of composure while cringing inside. 
I have had to literally get up and leave the room watching Larry David.  
Jackass when they're messing with each other I'm perfectly fine with but when they start messing with random strangers, I can't handle it.  Those guys signed up to look like a fool or have some crazy stuff happen to them on camera.  The average person going about their day did not.
/r/cannotwatchscottstots
The Office UK is beautifully cringey. And by that I mean it's a brutal cringefest. 
Peep Show is the most awkward thing I've ever watched. It hurts to watch, but I love it.
Ben Stiller movies exemplify this. 
Yes!! I **hated** those movies for that reason. About twenty minutes in, I assumed Meet the Fokkers (or was that the sequel?) was going to end in murder suicide because no other possible ending could be satisfying. Then friends made me watch Bridesmaids. I opted to get sloppy drunk because it made me so fucking uncomfortable.I get embarrassed for them, but when it keeps going I lose all empathy and just flip to this deep, disproportionate rage. 
If Ben Stiller created it, Ricky Gervais has perfected it. The Office was bad, Extras was even worse, and then he went full retard and did a show about a mentally challenged caretaker. I liked the original version of The Office that he did but his other stuff is too much. 
Don't worry about it. Stuffing up and things failing is just part of live theatre. We're all going to head backstage and laugh about it after the lights go down, and it happens all the time. We expect things to go wrong and working round them is part of the show. 
dude whenever I rewatch the dumb starbucks episode(this is my go-to episode that I show people to introduce N4U), I always skip the music parody thing because the cringe is real.
I clicked on this thread just to mention the Inbetweeners. I love it but it's so painful for me to watch.
that depends for me.  if the story only involves the five main characters, I can watch it all day.  watch "Reynolds vs Reynolds: The Cereal Defense" for an episode where their assholishness only hurts each other.  it's comfy as fuck.if the story causes the main characters to terrorize an innocent outsider, it gets a little cringey.IASIP is nowhere near as reliant on cringiness as other shows mentioned here.  I love it.
I've loved Louis CK's standup since the 90s, so I kept giving Louie another shot.Every new season I would watch an episode to see if I or the show had changed.  Every time I'd want to gouge my eyes out.His standup is still terrific.  Joe Pesci had it completely backwards.  Louis CK should stay far away from TV and movies, and dedicate his whole life to standup.
I found parks and rec to rely less on cringe humour than the office, at least after the first season. I couldn't handle the office at all, but I loooove parks and rec!
I'll come out of my long time lurk to give u a hell yes for Hank the Cowdog!
That one episode where he bails on paying for the kids college... so painful.
This show made me incredibly uncomfortable.  I liked it a lot, but I could only watch a couple episodes because it made me so uncomfortable.The Office I have no problem watching, maybe because it's so obviously not real.  Same with a lot of the other shows people mention in this thread.The ones that seem real are much worse for me.  Ali G is another that gets to me.
Also, arrested development never seems as "real" for me. Nothing ever sticks to these people, they are all so far insane I just sit back and laugh until I cry
I'm going to ballpark it and guess that he followed you and did something mildly racist, then when you collapsed into a fetal ball of cringe, he made a remark using the word cripple. In front of a disabled person. 
And then sometimes he just does the exact opposite and it's the worst thing ever.I sit there and start moaning at my tv, "Noooo Larry whyyyyy. OH MY GOD NO not that! Oh god that's even worse! Oh my god, Larry you are so... no, no, no. oh god just stoopppp."
To be fair, any time you see a person on Jackass who doesn't have their face blurred out, they've signed a release form. They may not have been in on the home at the moment, but rest assured they were at least informed of what happened afterwards.
Meet the Parents is my go-to example for this type of comedy. It seems to be falling down in popularity for movies and going into television like The Office and Parks and Rec, and I honestly thing it's better in those. Shorter durations, no need for a central "hero" to have the conflict center around them, etc. Movies have swapped over to The Hangover kind of comedy, where the absurdity is ramped up while the characters do less to pretend like everything is okay and do more to just *survive* the absurd scenario and act as equally shocked as the viewer would.
Yeah, that kind of stuff makes me want to compress my body down into a singularity out of embarrassment 
In the sequel, there's a scene where his fiancee's dad is wearing a pair of fake tits to feed a baby and asks ben stiller to touch them. Somehow, he manages to make it super awkward and cringey EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT THE ONE WEARING FAKE TITS!
1,000+ subs?!?! I haven't made it that far in the series yet but now I can't wait.
And Business School, which is like right before Phyllis's Wedding. Just so much cringe from so many angles. 
The dinner party episode is cringe but so fucking funny. There's some great one liners. I also saw the season blooper real and there's some clips from that episode and they are hilarious. Michael and Jan keep cracking up during scenes at the dinner party. 
Peep Show is worse
It absolutely is.  The US version has heart, while the UK is just brutal (which I think makes it soooo much better, but the shows are so different, to each her own).  That said, the Christmas Special series finale for the UK version is amazing and incredibly touching.  So if you never managed to finish, that's something worth knowing.
I think it's so hard because people truly endear Michael Scott.
Best thing about it was both characters felt like real people. You meet people like Gareth all the time in office work. Dwight (the American Gareth) is just too over the top to be a believable person.
My grandma grew up in the same village as Ingvar Kamprad. I'll introduce this idea next time I bump in to him!
It's completely agonizing. Great show
Then have you seen *The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margarett*?  I found it hard to watch, but you might like it.
Yep, can't handle meet the parents. Just 2 hours of watching this guys life get shit on over and over again.
Yeah! Yeah *exactly*.
I didn't think Derek was cringey, just one hell of an emotional roller coaster 
Why don't you like Louie? I'm not trying to be a contrarian asshole, but it's really one of my favorite shows. What is it about it that rubs you the wrong way?
exactly how i felt!
God dang, I'm glad to see many other people suffer from this. Not in a sadistic way, just glad I'm not too weird.
The USA *did* have the option of using German as a national language, but nooooo.... :P
*Nothing* is better than Schadenfreude.
It's because we do go through a lot of oddball emotional situations. For example Kummerspeck is also a word here, it refers to the weight you gain when you feel depressed or just broke up with someone.
> It means being ashamed for a stranger.This is literally what it means. It's a combination word of the words 'strange' and 'shame'
haha Loved those as a kid. Especially the singing on the audio book versions. Sill though, Hank the Cowdog had some super cringe moments hurt my soul sometimes. :P
You're not the only one/r/CannotWatchScottsTots
I've never laughed harder at a show.  I could definitely see the parts where he asks to hang out with the people he's helping and they try to make excuses but he keeps pressing the issue as painful to watch though.
I love Peep Show. The whole cinematography is designed to make you as uncomfortable as possible.
Yeah, it's almost comical which makes it less real. Whereas The Office can almost be relatable - Everyone knows SOMEONE who is a bit like everyone on there
Jim was a well-adjusted, cool guy.Tim was a depressed loser.
I'm aware and that's fine if they were OK with it afterwards but at that moment they were involuntarily being messed with so the cringeworthiness stands. 
I had to walk out of "Daddys Home" because that's all the movie was, every scene. Made my physically agitated.
Wow, that's the exact mental image I have when I feel embarrassed! I thought I was the only one!
Give it some time - it keeps gets better and less cringey as it goes. It really takes off about midway through the 2nd season and just keeps getting better. It has one of the most thorough/satisfying series finales I've seen.
It's....you have to watch it. You *have* to watch it, and you'll never want to watch it again. But the episode is genius and displays one of the most Michael Scott-y events in the series.
Poop is raining from the ceiling. Poop.
That's a $200 plasma screen TV you just destroyed! Good luck paying me back on your $0 a year salary plus benefits, BABE!
oh god yes. what I love about it is that it gets progressively insane but it all makes sense. like the stag episode where he ends up eating grilled dog. fuck
That's why if you watch season two of the US office the lighting is a lot different. The show didn't do too well because the US audience found Michael Scott to be too cringey and idiotic, so they revamped his image to be a loveable kindhearted idiot. They also made the lighting more "warm"  because prior lighting made the show appear "cold". I like both, and both cater to the audiences who watched each. That said, the Christmas special for the UK version felt really great and well earned. Finally turn around for characters that deserved it.
I agree. There's tons of cringey moments without real redemption in the first season (although of course none as bad as Scott's Tots) and people are fine with it. We aren't attatched to him yet. In Scott's Tots, we care about Michael Scott, even if he is a big idiot sometimes. So to see him fuck up THAT badly, is painful. My $0.02
I really can't watch more than one or two episodes at a time.  I get too depressed.  Good stuff. 
This is how I recommend shows to people. "Oh it wasn't for me but I bed you'd love it" *because you have terrible taste in everything*
Is that what the show turned out like? I only saw the first episode and just didn't feel like going through the series. 
Yepp, there are still a lot of empathetic people like us who can't take watching other people suffer (at least psychologically). Whether this suffering is self-inflicted or inflicted by others doesn't matter. Some things just hurt. That might be a cringeworthy chat-up line or a miserably fucked-up attempt to sing... It just hurts. Physically. I can't stand that. Not even for a moment. 
It we had lots of towns and cities who did official government work in German. Then something happened around 1940
lebenslangerschicksalsschatz?
German compound names are just descriptions. I love it.
so say we coin it in english, strangeshame. i cant watch the office because i feel strangeshame. kinda like that? its just intersting to me how english has tonal taboos when it comes toforming new words, because in cantonese new concepts are given words immediatley from the root words while english it seems harder to make it "stick" 
Just... Wow. 
I tried to watch it because I love David Mitchell. But I tapped out in the first 10  minutes. Fuck, It was too cringy.
there's a reason the british version went for 2 series vs the 9 seasons the US version got. 
Alright, I keep with it, thanks. :)
WAIT WAIT. They're lithium!
I couldn't even finish it in one sitting.
"Omg I can't watch Scott's Tots" has got to be the biggest circlejerk in The Office subreddits.   It isn't any worse than any of the other embarrassing things Michael does in the other episodes. It's funny! Enjoy the episode people! 
This is interesting.I came late to the US version and couldn't get into it - I basically felt like it missed the whole point of the concept - like they couldn't follow through with the cold horrible truth, he had to be a nice guy and the other characters did too.Never thought about the lighting but that cold lighting was a huge part of the dispassionate "realist" feel which gave us distance in the original.The main love plot in the UK version is essentially a car crash between two deeply dysfunctional people.
Yeah the show is better than the pilot, but still the weakest of the three. It's biggest problem isn't the fact that it's making fun of people like Derek, but actually the opposite - it paints them as immaculate angels who we could all learn from etc. etc. It gets little sappy about it.I still recommend it! Dougie's exasperation never stops being funny.
Hahahahah!!! Tell him there's a lad in Buenos Aires that can **absolutely** relate!
Which is NOT the same as "pene ajeno"
Look at me, I'm so empathetic.
Putting my historian hat on for a moment, it was more likely WW1. The cultural hate was stronger in the First World War, perhaps because there was a much stronger bogeyman of a leader present in WW2. Typically, WW1 was when people were renaming cities, foods, etcetera. 
Yeah, the argument for "English needs an equivalent word for schadenfreude" gets weaker all the time. Why would we need one at this point? Words aren't a finite resource. It's not like the Germans can't use it anymore.It would be awesome to see fremdschamen gain the traction that schadenfreude has though. It's way cooler than "second-hand embarrassment". 
I hate that Episode because of that word. Yes you can theoretically do that in German, but no one here would do that
The second and this seasons steel much better IMO, give it another shot
Oh god is that the one where he has to pretend to be a college student?
Because Americans don't know when to quit? (Don't worry, I'm American)
I dunno man, to me it's the magnitude of his actions and the failure to deliver to the kids. I mean, if you think about it, there's so many consequences to his idiotic actions, moreso than the other episodes. That's what makes it awful for me. 
It is a great episode as well as being super cringe. It's pretty common knowledge on reddit how cringe that episode is, but I watched it waaaaaay before seeing it even being mentioned and could still remember feeling physically uncomfortable watching it. 
Cool, TIL. So Nazi/German hate was sowed into the fabric of geopolitics well before Hitler came to power? 
Oh, just some little kerfuffle.
I learned it from some psych textbook in the late 90s after describing to a girlfriend why I had to leave our highschool play that she was prominently featured in...
Americans in the entertainment industry have a very narrow idea of what they want German to sound and look like. Probably because it's funnier when you shout it at people. I hate it but this is the reason most of us think German is an angry sounding language when, in my opinion, it's a beautiful one. 
yeah, i think it should have ended when steve carell quit. it does trainwreck a bit towards the end. 
I agree with you, and I think another part of why it was one of his biggest fuckups is because it involved children, especially knowing how much Michael LOVES kids. Classic Michael, trying to do a good thing and fucking up, but you can kind of see why this was his biggest screw up because he just loves kids and wanted to do his grandest gesture possible for them without thinking about whether it was plausible. 
Or you know, different people have different feelings about things. 
In fact that's part of the reason hitler was able to gain power; his platform was centered on the mistreatment of Germans after WW1. Hitler spoke of the "power hungry Jews" and the "draconian war reparations" and treaty of Versailles in several "us against the world" speeches. The nazi party never gained a majority of any vote but hitler was able to gain enough support in power circles to gain the position of chancellor. Hindenburg's death allowed a bloodless coup bit the whole rise to power was seeded in the perceived oppression of Germans after WW1. 
Oh yeah the shouting, but it got better over the years with some celebrities actually speaking german instead of just shouting
There's always the historical issue of the impact of man vs the impact of the forces of history.Although we can't be sure , how different do you think that period would have been without Hitler ?
It's certainly possible that the Nazi Party might never have gained power without the use of a powerful demagogue. But it seems likely to me that, if not Hitler, then some other gifted orator could have similarly rallied Germany to war post-WW1. 
Thank you. It makes me feel better knowing that so many people are disgusted by this. We have a lovely culture and a big part of it is sharing, we love having guests and making friends.
I became close with a teacher from Iran.Today he was so sad.It hurts to see someone like that affected by something so stupid. 
I think every country whose dual citizens are banned should definitely follow suit. This order is an insult to their system of government and status as a sovereign nation.Literally the fastest way to get this reversed and the easiest method to show Trump the limits of unilateral action in the modern world. Such a great opportunity... 
The ACLU filed a suit so hopefully it gets reversed quickly. 
I'm sorry for all of the US really :(
They're due back this week, but now who knows. And my teacher has a blanket 'no late work' policy and the papers are 60% of the grade. I had 100% and have never had a late assignment before. She's not nice.
The circus is a valid path, I've been training for three years as a back up plan. That comment was only a half joke ha.I'm sorry to hear that :( I hope your week gets better.
That's cold, sorry man. It'll take a while, but through a lot of pain you'll come out the other end stronger and better. Keep your head up.
cause they're muslims. 
Ooooh, a date! That's exciting! Whatcha gonna do? And Japanese is so cool! How long have you been learning?Her name is Athena, but I mostly call her Memow or Queena :)
Only on people who are already in the US, I think. Meaning all the folks detained at the airports. The new entry ban is still on.
A singular circus is closing down :)
When I went to Italy I found an Iranian woman's place on Airbnb and stayed there for a month. She was super sweet and helpful, and since I didn't have any friends she would take me with her to her mates' place for lunch on the weekends. They made delicious Iranian food from their cities and were super hospitable. They were also all super helpful and whenever they'd come over to my roommate's place they would ask me to sit with them. They were so lovely and I found their culture SO welcoming!
Yes, many who voted for Trump did so because they thought he'd bring jobs, not because they are racist or Islamaphobic. So even if he won, it doesn't mean all who voted agree with the worst of him. Just that they somehow managed to ignore it.
WTF? This is maddening. People can buy property but can't live on that property?  I don't think that I or many other Americans understand how fucked this really is.
>It hurts to see someone like that affected by someone so stupid.  FTFY I don't think the ban itself can be completely explained or categorized as stupid, I think that's a very subtle word for it. It saddens me "we" as a society have gone this far back after all the progress we'd made in recent decades. 
Seriously.. I almost feel like he planned it around this time so we couldn't see loved ones. You're not alone, many of us are going through this as well. No matter what he does, the sun will still move and the New Years still exist. Stay strong.
Not only internment camps but concentration camps. He signed this order on Holocaust Remembrance Day. Can you believe the audacity? For shame.
Have you contacted the ACLU? Sometimes they need/want witnesses and actual claimants. 
No they did not. They allowed those currently in transit (en route) and released those who were detained at the airports. There is no mess. Trump said today the plan is working beautifully.
We aren't all like him. I just want you to know that. I sincerely hate that man and his administration. They're monsters and bring incredible shame to this country.
Please try talking to her anyway. You have nothing to loose. If she won't budge, could you drop the class and take an incomplete? You may need to contact the ACLU for help for your family. They are filing papers to fight this. Do you know them?
Ok now that's actually pretty cool. What does training entail?
Thanks man. You wouldn't think it, but getting it off my chest and having someone say something back to me really helped. It's been a helluva day. Thank you for taking time out of your day to respond to me. 
Thanks man
I got to Japan in 2013, was here for two years then went to Korea for a year, now I am back in Japan. I started learning about 1 year into my first year here. I am not as good as I should be, but I have been picking it up more diligently recently. I think we are going to grab some dinner then go to a themed bar in Tokyo! Hopefully a jazz bar with some good beer, I dig those haha.That's a dope name! 
> This is not what our country means, or stands for.If that would be the case the US wouldn't have chosen Trump for president and Republicans in both chambers of Congress.  Actually it *is* what the country means and stands for (anno 2017), and if you think otherwise you're fooling yourself.
People forget how easily we all can become refugees. 
To be fair, I think everyone knew what he was about during the campaign and they should own their decisions.
That's exactly what's happening to a ton of people who are mid travel when this change happened. These people don't need to be vetted, they already were. A blanket ban just makes people more extreme
In only 1 week!
I doubt Trump knows well enough to know that. He's just trying to jam in as much bullshit as humanly possible right away.
I'm looking into it right now to see if they need/want any of that! I'm gonna set up a recurring donation when I get paid again.
I'm not American but I'm really touched by all the people coming out in solidarity and condemning this administration. 
I sent her a message and she said she's not taking it. I'll try again on Tuesday when I see her. I'm in my last year and I'll have to wait another year to take the class, the department is really small.And yes, thank you, I've been reading up on them a lot, and CAIR too, and talking to my dad. I read that they're doing it case by case, so if that's true, hopefully they aren't held for too long since they're doctors.
I started going to a class, and then one by one everyone else quit and it was just me and the teacher and from there, it's only ramped up! Circus hurts and weeds people out that way.I do trapeze training 3x a week, handstand practice, ballet, and conditioning 3x a week! :) I started for exercise and then it was the best thing for my mental health and physical health!
Cirque du Soleil that shit uppp
I feel you, and glad you got something positive out of it. I've been there before. When my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me I was wrecked for a full year. Couldn't hold a relationship with anyone for more than a month without spiraling out, beer for breakfast, that sort of thing. Eventually I came out of it, but it took a lot of work. Happily married now. Hang in there!
Amazing! What do you do for work, if you don't mind? I want to go to grad school for foreign policy! I've been learning French for 10 years and still feel like I'm not where I should be, I think that's just a trait of language learning haha.That sounds like an awesome time! I've always wanted to go to Japan.And thanks! I adopted her when she was 5 and I thought it would be weird to change her name when she was already an adult.
I've actually read a lot of posts saying how Trump was over exaggerating to bring attention to issues, for free media, or to distract people from something. I think to a lot of even Trump supporters this came as a somewhat surprise.
For a long time the US banned Chinese people from coming to America. Most would argue that that was bad, but it was very much constitutional. Trump's Muslim ban follows in the same line and is within his powers.I think the blanket ban is really stupid, but not liking something doesn't make it unconstitutional. 
No where in his EO does it state its against Muslims. 
I've always believed that as a species  we are smart enough to see the cycle, but too stupid to break free of it. An individual can, but not society as a whole. 
It's probably better that you did. Better the devil you know...
Hey, not sure if you've heard this yet, but Trump's order has been temporarily "paused". If your family gets detained, contact the ACLU immediately. They have lawyers at major airports to assist with this.
I guess it depends on the school, but sometimes going to the dean/headmaster and making your case can be useful. Might be worth a try. BTW, I'm a teacher and this idea in general makes me cringe a bit (i.e., administrator dictating to teachers), but if there are/were extenuating circumstances, it couldn't really hurt. Just be respectful if it doesn't go your way.
That's really cool. Makes me want to start back up with my exercise regime. School always burns me out and i lose all my healthy habits.
Thank you for the positive words :)
I am US Military. Air Force, I work on computer networks and security. It's not too bad a gig, but can't wait to get out haha
So what do you consider a credible website? salon, Huffington Post, CNN, MSNBC?All sites that have lied about this executive order.
I did not comment on the morality of it. Someone said this was unprecedented. That's not true.
Wasn't the blanket ban on asiatic countries the reason congress passed laws outlawing this kind of thing and wasn't that same country-based restriction ruled against in the courts?
That's implied. It is explicitly based on country of origin and current residence though, and that is enough.
When was it paused? 
Ooh, that should be interesting. 
I'm a French major and I intended on going to grad school. I'll look and see if there's anything online and equivalent, but I swear the longer I'm in university, the more they just want to bleed you and don't care about the rest.Thank you, it's scary for my family. We love this country and it hurts to see this all happening.
Do it! I'm in the best shape of my life. I hated exercise until I found one that I can't imagine living without anymore. A trapeze artist is just what I am :)
The executive order bans these countries from coming to the US.   But it also allows for "religious minorities" in those countries to come to the US.   In each of the countries, Islam is the majority religion.   Meaning you can't come if you're Muslim, but can if you're any other religion. 
Arguing wether his reasoning for the ban is correct or not is a completely different conversation than wether or not it's constitutional.
I know all about the costs. I went back to college as an adult, and both my daughters were in college too. Total cost: $240,000. Each one of us pays our own loans. It is scary. I can't imagine what you all must be feelings. I am so angry. Racism and Hatred are occupying the Oval office. However, it gives me great hope when so many of us are protesting, contacting congressional representatives, etc. We will fight that bastard until the end.
That's awesome. I'm a real fan of urban exploration and had been training in parkour for a while, school and money took priority though. I'm finally a senior so I have the time again!
Ouch :( I am blessed to have very minimal debt and hopefully I can keep it that way. I found an equivalent course online though, now the question is if my school will take it. They're strict on upper division transfer credits.I'm going to a rally tomorrow night to help show that real humans are affected by this. A lot of folks don't know many, if any, Iranian people and the media's view is all we tend to have of each other.
I tried parkour once! Totally kicked my ass. I am a one dimensional acrobat hahaha.I get the money and school, I had to take a summer off of training once :(  What's your major??
I bet they will take it. If not you can petition them.No protests near me, or I would go too. Glad you are going! Would you please check back with me and tell me what happened? Take some pics?
Actually only in highschool, lol. I've finished my applications though, looking into fields of Computer Science and Audio Engineering. 
The judge ordered the stay for the writ of habeas corpus because of violation of due process rights. This will be argued in court because it is not as black and white as you wish it to be. 
Yes, I'll do that! It'll be my first, I couldn't make the women's marches due to work :(
Relevant username!
so did you have something planned or not?
I quit Monday morning and had it all figured out by Wednesday evening.
You can do it in a safer way.Look for the new job and then turn things upside down. You don't need to take the risk of simply quitting and being unemployed.
So, how do magnets work?
Can you elaborate on how your travels changed your perspective and gave you purpose? I've heard others say it and never thought to ask. 
What part of NC? If you're rural it's going to be a yuge culture shock. And I mean that. 
This sounds like my dream.
Yup! Never having kids because I want to be happy. 
I think most people do. We're all too scared to pull the trigger on either. Hang in there... We're all trying to figure ourselves out. 
San Diego is my dream city. I don't know why you'd ever leave!
I'm from Portland, is the scene bigger in San Diego? I feel like all I do is drink craft beer.
LinkedIn and Craigslist.
Wanna make it happen?
In general... if my partner all of a sudden starts saying "You wanna pack up and move with me??" alarm bells would be ringing. I'm sure their partner has a life where they live, it's not so simple as love and trust. Sometimes you get lucky and you both want the same thing but instability can be a relationship killer
I was planning to move to Austin Texas. Shortly after I quit I went for a week long visit and it was not everything I hoped it would be. So the plan ended there.
Yep. Rather a lot of it in fact.
*scene, btw :) 
Nice!  I don't know if I'll stay. So far I've gotten more out of moving than I expected, so it's a win no matter what. But after living in and around NYC for near 5 decades, Nashville is a bit...well...dull.
Oh it was hilarious. He just "oh, fuck"ed.A bit of background, we were in "disaster recovery" space because 7 months earlier an islamopithicine had flown an airplane into our office building while we were working.So stress was already high and "fuckit"itude was running pretty rampant around the office.
I live with 2 friends. As is after paying my share of rent and such, plus basic necessities, I have around 200 dollars left each month. It's not that I can't save money or anything. It's just that at this rate it's going to take a while for me to save enough to comfortably move to wherever I want. I mean, I have nothing tying me down from leaving, in fact I get close and close to doing it each day. It's just not financially viable for me. (Yet)
Wow!  That's so fast!  Had you been looking into it beforehand or did you just luck out?
Being in a single-income household, I wouldn't just walk out of a job. It is impressive, though, that people are able to do it and make it work without ruining literally everything.
But he makes twice as much. 
I love all of the naysayers. People do this all the time. It's scary, and a lot don't make it. But it's certainly doable. 
Ummm, shit, I've been found out. How could I ever have anticipated someone actually asking? C'mon
Travel, just by its essence, changes perspectives. And traveling didn't give me purpose so much as it gave me time and a new perspective in which to find my purpose within myself.
Advance. Trust me i know
It's hard to explain when you grew up here, I think everyone gets a case of wanderlust when they're confined to where they've grown up, regardless of how amazing others view it. Sometimes I have to remind myself that people save up to take a vacation here. When I lived in Brooklyn, I dated someone who was born and raised there. Jaded doesn't even begin to cover it. But again, it's a dream city for many.
Thanks! I am a .NET developer. There's always work out there, more so if you're flexible with where it is. 
It might be. I know San Diego is one of the hubs of the scene and there are a ton of breweries popping up all the time. We have Ballast Point and Stone down here, I think those are our big ones.
This is incredibly fast! Most companies drag things out by saying they have more candidates to interview, and then some more time goes by before they reply again. What's your industry field?
Conspiracy charges here we come!! 
Yeah maybe do more of a "throw a dart at a map and take off to there for a weekend" type deal.
I dunno, I really dislike these kind of shallow mountain wisdom. I think people can advance while playing safe, building up a happy life step by step, just like people can screw up everything by risking too much. I know nowadays these one-sentence philosophies (and tons of motivational quotes everywhere) are extremely popular, but I think most of them are plain BS.
Haha yes! Being from California everyone told me that the only plane in Texas I would like is Austin. Visited last march and kind of underwhelmed. I loved Dallas on the other hand and I'm moving there in July!
So this option isn't open to a lot of people. I imagine the advice we're seeing in this thread could ruin a whole lot of people. It needs a disclaimer
I've thought about doing Peace Corps (my longtime SO has talked about doing it too), but I worry about returning after 1-3 years with no prospects. Like I don't think it'd make me significantly more employable and my field is already on the down and very competitive.
ha, whoopsie doodle
I came from Dallas so I know the feeling. I feel like one day I'll go back, but my career has progressed so much here, I don't see myself going back anytime soon.
Yeah, I've never had something that drastic happen to me, but I've been in situations where everyone around you is quitting and you have to hold it together. I can't blame you for quitting. In my case, I had to hold it together or I would have been stranded in Atlanta for a summer.
How's that going man? I'm 18 and gonna start pre nursing when I graduate high school and looking forward to it! 
I take it student loans aren't an option?
Honestly I had no plans of this as of Monday at 8 AM. But I had been talking to the owner of a different company for about 6 months on LinkedIn and I knew he would hire me, and with Craigslist and FaceTime it wasn't hard to find a place that was a good match at all.
OP said above that he had the job lined up
>It's scary and a lot don't make itHence "what he's doing is NOT easy." You're as much of a naysayer as him.
So... why are lobsters immortal?
Get ye to Winston-Salem or Raleigh and do not look back, my child. Avoid Statesville. Tis a silly place. Greensboro is meh. 
I'll bring the rope! 
70% chance you're taking a cruise.
The point isn't that these soundbites are universally true, and equally applicable to everyone and every situation. The point is that you find a few that ring with you and your particular life experience. If you've found that playing it safe hasn't gotten you anywhere, and maybe you're too anxious or worried about doing things that benefit you, then it might seem true to you and you adopt it into your lifestyle. It's literally the same as any other motivational or inspirational story - what you get out of it depends on how you, as an individual, decide to read into it.
Yeah, I was born in raised in Cali. My brother actually lives in Austin and I went to visit him. He had just broken up with his girlfriend of over a year and was more of an insufferable little shit that normal. Was fed up with him in about 4 hours and pretty much ruined the trip for me. Also, it was 100% humidity without raining one day. Which is just terrible. I have always kind of irrationally hated Dallas (I am a Redskins fan) so I have never really given it any attention. I know a couple of people out there that love it. Good luck on the move! 
It definitely seems like they can't keep up with the population influx. I think Portland is having the same issues. They want to keep it a small city but it is already way past that.
I can't even remember what exactly I was looking. It just didn't feel like home. Even knowing several people there, I just didn't feel very comfortable.
I don't think /u/madwilliamflint was giving advice. He was just telling us about a time in his life which happened to be relevant to the OP. In a casual way... casually conversational even.
I think people are really over reading this.- Saved money.- Quit job. (I hadn't planned on it. Just had enough.)- Went on trips to Iceland, Ecuador, Costa Rica, The Galapagos Islands, and Warsaw.
It does depend on your field but my friend in economics says that Peace Corps significantly helps as experience in his field. Practical, hands-on experience in helping the systems of other places, disaster relief, building, teaching...Honestly all of those skills should be invaluable to society but capitalism ain't set up that way...
Stupid sexy Flanders...
I won't likely go back to Brooklyn. Not unless I hit it big. It's just too much of a soul suck. But I'll definitely head back north. I can't take this weather. Winter is supposed to be winter.
There were a lot of reasons I couldn't do it anymore.  It was a little ptsd/survivor guilt. But primarily I'd developed this software product and because I was the expert, I was relegated to doing nothing but support, which was a complete waste of brain. 
North. First one hit, 2nd one down.
Ah, so you had the security of a landing pad set up already.
jw, why not Charlotte? I heard traffic is awful but other than that it's pretty straight. Always heard Asheville was fun but SOL was pretty high.
I love all of your usernames. 
While you're right in a general the-earth-is-mostly-covered-by-water sense it's important to note that depending on the map the water might be squished to account for the transcription of a spherical object to a (presumably) rectangle.Interestingly enough though some map makers are notorious for having made Africa super small to help reduce this distortion, so OP might end up not going to Ethiopia after all.Also I'm really sorry I just can't sleep right now and this is how I'm handling not firing up the pc to play video games. Good day. Fuck.
Why call it a sound bite when you can more accurately describe it as a "quote" in fewer letters?
Good to hear. I always enjoy introducing people to some aussie artists when i can as they are often criminally underrated.Id also recommend you check out thundamentals they just released their new album and its fantastic haha.
Except by those of us from Dallas. There really isn't quite anywhere like it
Yep, it makes traffic here such a shit show. The first apartment I got when I moved was 3 miles away from my job and on the same road, but my commute would still take 20-30 minutes, it was completely ridiculous. I could've walked faster if there had been sidewalks along that road!
How much did you have to save?
Wait. Are you telling me this sub is for casual conversation?? I had no idea! :0
Obviously everyone does what the internet tells them to do without any self responsibility.
>It's their life to fuck up.This is why we don't have nationalized healthcare in the US
of course most people's' wild lifestyle would be "homeless."
This same argument always comes up when someone talks about how they uprooted their life and went travelling. People get really salty and say "WELL NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT. IT TAKES MONEY.", and then the argument generally turns in to how the people that do this sort of thing live with their parents or are being helped in some way. This site is filled with a lot of angry, sad people.
Ignore this if you don't want to answer... but I am genuinely interested lol. 1. What made you decide those places to go?2. You stayed in hotels for these trips? Flights? And what was the longest and short trip?3. What kind of job did you have before? I'm 18 and need some ideas for careers bc Dairy Queen isn't cutting it. Thank you!
This Texas boy is glad there isn't snow often. I did one winter in Columbus, and it was enough for me to take it off the potential destination list.
Pfft, I don't know what companies expect when they put people in those positions. Of course you are going to quit. And then you leave and no one else knows how to use what you created since they didn't have you teach anyone.
Were you in the building at the time? I was visiting my dad in world financial that day. I had surgery on my leg, and was in a wheelchair. I was 8. He pushed me forever up the west side highway. 
Good! I hope that helps, at least a little bit. Best of luck to you, feel free to PM me if you need any suggestions for school/breaking into a new area.
That probably wasn't obvious to him when he made the decision. People can rarely point out their saving grace before they're in trouble. I think the point is that if you make these brash decisions in accordance with your authentic wants then a viable path will present itself to you and you'll later think "of course; it's so obvious". 
He had networking set up. He was prepared. Not the same as having a job offer. :)
Do you like my username?
"spontaneous"
Why question how people phrase things naturally? I don't know, maybe they aren't all actually quotes, or maybe I wanted to reflect the other person's nonchalant approach to the sayings, or maybe I just wanted to use more words because I preferred the cadence. The other person also grouped "one-sentence philosophies" and "motivational quotes," implying they're different, so if I were to use "quotes," it wouldn't necessarily seem inclusive. I can't point it out exactly, but I'm sure there are reasons.
The Waitress Song is so good. I went to learn the chords so I could cover it, but ended up staying up late last night writing a new song with that as my inspiration.
Oh yeah, definitely by people who aren't from there or haven't been there. I think it has a bad rep for being rich and snobby, but there's so many different neighborhoods, there's something for everyone. 
Mind.Blown.
Directions unclear. Dick stuck in responsibility.
Yeah, no. That's not even close to the same thing. 
Eh, I love camping and living on the land.
The trips were only a couple few weeks.  A couple of them I had friends who were going.  Costa Rica I think I got a deal.  I went to Poland to see a girl (my first time out of the US in fact.)  Iceland was just... magic.  I'd say "I can't wait to go back" but it was 14 years ago, so apparently I can.I'm a programmer. I'd been working on wall street for about a decade by then, doing pretty well for myself as a C++ server-side guy.
Actually, I would say PC has real potential to help you out.  In general, the people who complain about "missing" 2 years of work experience to do PC are usually those in highly technical fields like computer science or engineering.  Fields that require more soft skills tend to benefit more.  You learn about public speaking, working in a different culture, the issues surrounding poverty, another language (usually).  As an example, a friend of mine joined after a series of shitty sales jobs and left to go work for a State Government doing emergency management.
Ohio? Yeah, small wonder. Do an autumn or winter in upstate NY or Vermont. It's breathtaking. 
It's so peculiar. It was a high performance bond trading system, not exactly "setting up someone's wordpress blog" or something. And....I was....answering questions on the phone? Sorry guys. Time for me to go. 
Yep. I'd been in the office a couple hours. Can't imagine having to have gone through that pushing (or being pushed) in a wheelchair that day.
Dead on, my most recent correspondeces with him were a voicemail I didn't return a month ago and a message on LinkedIn 3 weeks ago asking if I'd received his VM that I hadn't replied to. I had forgotten about both at this point and didn't consider this guy until hours after I'd formally quit.
Well you did just say "And I knew he would hire me".That's significantly different than "I moved to SoCal and then randomly got a job."It's still a big move and congrats. 
lol I love it 
It's not hippy or liberal like Austin (though I could stand it to be a bit more so lol) and there really are some snobby people, but at least it's not pretend cowboys. I feel like Dallas is the ultimate "normal" city. A bit of everything with a lot of opportunities. I always tell people that Dallas has a job for them and housing is fairly reasonable. So far no luck convincing anyone to make the move though. 
Mine is in the mail
Shit man, I could buy a team of sled-chickens to ride for that
There should be a /r/randomsuggestion 
Yeaahhhh. The right to medical care is *rather* different to the privilege of being able to quit, pack your bags and leave on a moments notice. Of course, it'd be awesome if everyone *did* have that option. There'd be a lot fewer stressed out, strung out, miserable people slowly dying in a job they hate. Hey, might even bring health expenditure down! 
Right? He moved to another city to work in the same industry and had enough savings for move in costs for a new apt. That's awesome, but not all that much of a life changing, throw it all to the wind moment. 
I do it all the time, I just add a ton of people. Like a company? Add the managers/directors of the department you have relevant skills, fuck it, add the owner. A percentage of those people will accept your request, I message some of those people and a percentage reply. Nothing over 3 sentences and end it with a question.
Wait...your responsibility..or...?
It's not some special right or advantage. The people worked for it.
Porque no los dos? 
Oh, I wasn't intending it like that at all. Of course if you've worked hard and saved enough, you deserve to do what you want with that money including travel. The bit I was getting at was that access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, regardless of how much you 'earn' or are supposedly entitled to. Illness does not discriminate based on income, so neither should medical services.  
I got this too!
"I'm a princess!"but seriously though, is the duck one a reference joke?
I upvoted your comment and it said "Thanks, Obama." :D
Mine says Yer an upvoter, Harry.
That's one small upvote for man, one giant leap for my time.
Ay lmupvote
Have you hugged a stranger today?
Same! It's a lovely virtual atmosphere we have here today.
I got "I'm a princess" from yours :3
What are some other easter eggs you've noticed?
I think I'm having deja vu...Anyway, the Praetorian Guard was the Roman emperor's personal legion. They were responsible for defending the city of Rome and the Emperor himself. However, they were most famous for assassinating emperors.
Not at all.12/10 with rice.
it was a valiant effort.

Lots of people are commenting the messages that appear.
Yours is "born too late to downvote, just in time to upvote." Oh, the irony.
I have to be sneaky. If I'm not, there's a lot of people here who throw bricks at ducks, so I might get a brick thrown at me.
Looking through the top of all time on this sub, you realize that one of these pops up every once in a while, and everyone loves them.I think the reason the mods don't delete these is because they take it as a compliment. And, of course, I'm pretty sure /u/GodOfAtheism has a smug he needs to stroke.
Born too late to downvote, just in time to upvoteWhat's mine?
It's the same for everyone :p
Oh snap we can add to the upvote messages?!"Beam me upvote, Scotty!""By the power of the moon, I will upvote you!""Holy upvote, Batman!""I used to be a lurker like you, but then I took an upvote to the knee...""Have you tried turning the upvote off and on again?""With this upvote you will pierce the heavens!""For great justice!"...alright that's enough old memes and quotes for now. I should sleep.
I was hoping to preempt someone bringing up the reference in the comments, I literally haven't the foggiest
You have my upvote, and my thanks. Gave me a hearty chortle :)
The upvote button is a fountain of dank memes.
But it hides the downvote button, which I find offensive.  It's not like it stops people from disabling CSS and downvoting anyway.
I'm seeing them. Mostly they're meme stuff like ayy lmao, quest complete, etc etc etc
User used upvote, it's super effective!
Hey man, be careful, when I up voted him, it said he throws bricks at ducks!
You are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I like the rules bar a lot. I know the rollover drop down rules sidebar is used elsewhere, but it's usually pretty awkwardly done and hard to read. some of the subtle humor that is hidden in the sidebar also pleases me. 
Oh my bad, I didn't see that it was already asked!
Darn did not know rice was that much better...white, yellow, or brown rice?
"A wild Upvote appeared!"
i see it!what a nice touch!
I never knew that XDUpon testing in my own terms, it is "Ayy lmupvote", just as /u/LisaJustlisa said.
One time I threw a brick at a duck
The message is based on the 'thing ID' that's given to every post and comment. For example, OP's post's thing ID is `3escgd`(check in the url), so it matches this rule:    .thing[data-fullname$="d"]>.midcol>.upmod:focus:after {        content: "10/10 would upvote again"    }Hovering over my permalink, this comment's thing ID is `ctigrpr`, which matches:     .thing[data-fullname$="r"]>.midcol>.upmod:focus:after {         content: "DESTROY THEM WITH LASERS"     }
except then there's also "Have you hugged a stranger today?"...Upvotes, I'm getting mixed signals here.

One time I threw a brick at a duck.
Very casual
Illuminati confirmed.
When SO and I were introducing their soon to be step-siblings I had the great idea to take them to the park to feed ducks. It's was a little icy (interactions) until one of them threw a rock and gave the other two the idea. I stopped it fast but they seemed to warm up to each other. Then one farted in the car on the way home, which completely melted the ice. Set the tone for the following 12 years and beyond, I'm sure. 
I love it.
Wait, so did I. So now I know how this works. It gets assigned randomly when post is made, not when we upvote. 
Yah looks like it gets assigned when the post or comment is made, so it's part of the comment instead of having to run a random generator every time an upvote happens
Why would anyone downvote something in this subreddit? Everyone here is so friendly.
Are you some kind of wizard?Can you teach me the magicks?
I've got binders of upvotes.
I've been doing my best to hide. I'm kinda bad at it, though.
Thanks! :'D
"Never gonna give you up" ;Dalso on mine it says "anthyding can hadplen"
I agree. It works really well for this sub. Easy to read.
Don't worry, the mods marked this as a meta thread.*We must go deeper.*
I like white rice, but brown rice is great for cajun, or any food that has a stronger flavor than the rice. It's too rich and nutty for something without a strong flavor.So in this case, certainly brown rice.
Shoot, I didn't see that. I'll edit it in.
I really need to catch up on Gravity Falls episodes, because that reference went right over my head. Thanks anyways!
Thanks for this.

If we reply to each other's comments enough, but still remain anonymous, are we strangers? If we are strangers, should we hug? Do either of us have candy?

I am not a fan of brown rice myself.
Lisa, you shouldn't throw bricks at ducks. They're easily startled, but they'll soon return... and in greater numbers. ^^^Seriously, ^^^ducks ^^^are ^^^gangsters.
You're a princess. 
It's never Lupus. Except when it is.
No way dude. Nice to meat you brother :D
*gives you candy and a hug*I try not to think too hard about these things.
You will receive an upvote!
I'm ready for my next one
I don't see freeze peaches anywhere, just lots of friendly people conversing casually.Besides, downvotes may add vitriol and cruelty to this sub, and we don't like that kind of thing. Here, we join hands and eat pineapple.

I want a pineapple.  Life pro tip: If you are ever on Oahu, buy a pineapple from one of the roadside stands on the North Shore.  That was the best goddamn pineapple I ever had in my life.  (Once I got it.  The little girl ran away with my money until grandma tuned her up.)Second life pro tip:  If you buy a pineapple on the North Shore of Oahu,  don't eat too much of it in one day.  Don't ask me how I know.
or a way to disable just parts of the CSS? i know that's not how it works, but it would be nice

Yeah, seriously. If you ever see more than 4 ducks in one place, watch your butt.They'll run you down.

That's one small upvote for man, one giant leap for my time.
I dunno, those sugar-free diabetic cookies he used to make were pretty bad. But if he's gotten better about his diet cooking, then I might think about visiting.
I stayed in Waikiki too.  I'm not sure the pinnacle of anything is located in Waikiki.
Damn you people, now  I want pineapple! 
Bitch please, I'm fabulous.
Upvote your previous comments. Doesn't work if you are using mobile. 
DESTROY THEM WITH LASERS
I came here to up vote and chew bubblegum
You should, at least you get to taste the really healthy stuff ;)
It may not be the pinnacle of anything, but it wasn't really bad. Just a mediocre tourist/condo section. Apparently, it used to be Maui level, but it's gotten old.
Never gonna give you up
Studies have also been done with other ethnic names, such as traditionally sounding African or Hispanic names, and the same results happen. And any time it's brought up, you basically just get a bunch of people saying, "well parents shouldn't give their children those names because it harms their chances of getting a job." It's pretty sad that the solution seems to be "everyone should have generic whitebread names" instead of "everyone should try to avoid negatively stereotyping people due to their name."
My name's Mohammad and I go by Mo
Tinder is where you go to bury both your dick and your faith in humanity, generally speaking.
OP, this is what you someone asks why you put up Nick as your name
Holy shit, that's genius. I will keep that in mind. 
But, I have pictures of me with beer and partying... 
Racial bias is a thing on dating sites as well though, think there's been a few studies done about white people being less inclined to message a black person on dating sites  (not sure about the reverse or how different races affect it)Familiarity works here but for slightly different reasons.
I've heard that there is a stereotype in a lot of countries that white women are very promiscuous, due to porn.
Reminds me of the scam telephone calls where guys with ridiculously strong Indian accents say their name is David from the IRS and you have to pay them for delinquent taxes.
But like 80% of white americans identify as christian. Would you make the same assumption about them? Or someone with a Jewish last name? Having an "ethnic" name in reality has very little bearing on how religious you are, since the name is chosen by your parents, it's at most a reflection of your parents' religion.
I worked with a guy who was named Saddam Hussein right around the time Bush the second was invading Iraq. He introduced himself as 'Saddam' and I winced and went 'Ohh, I bet that's rough.' he just laughed and was like 'Oh, it gets worse, my last name is Hussein.' He was named before the other guy became well known so it was just an unfortunate coincidence.
Well, it depends on what you mean by racism. Apparently his presumed cultural identity was much more of a barrier than his biological race in this case.
I don't know. I guess, I thought of it, as my nick name. That way I can joke about it, and say my nick name is Nick, my actual name is Ahmad. 
If you are in the US, Mina sounds like a girl's name, so that might be confusing or if putting.
Travis is definitely not a great choice to attract women.  IMO of course.  Maybe other women think Travis is an amazingly sexy name.
That's genius! Except, I am not talented.
as a guy called Osama this scares me. To make it worse im an athesit, people will always assume im muslim 
>  couple self-deprecating jokesI wouldn't do that, especially when around girls....   I used to make a lot girlas laugh with my "Louis CK"-ish  self-depricative humor. But I realized that although they found me funny, it never worked to attract them. Instead, a mostly serious, and a mild sarcastic humor worked much better. But again, I might be wrong. 
This.  I don't understand how anyone is ignoring this.  Western women don't want to end up converting to Islam, so why waste time meeting someone you'll never want to connect with.
Yes, because it's totally racist for people from a Western Society to swipe right on Western names more than non-Western names. The dude lives in Toronto.
I am from Afghanistan. I have hazel eyes, dark brown hair , and fairly light skin, lighter than eastern Asians (people from Pakistan, India, Srilanka , etc.) Whenever someone tried to guess my background, they always start with" are you Latino?"  
The recruiting system where I work totally anonymises all applications before they get to me; all I see are the answers to the questions and an applicant number. It can be annoying, but it certainly strips away any (un)conscious bias gleaned from age, gender, perceived race etc.
From what some sits have, it is not technically illegal. But good luck getting to an interview and showing a different person/name.
I know 4 Mohammads none of whom go by Mohammad.
I want to be offended, but I'm gonna take that as I'm a good cook.
I met my fiance on tinder, we're getting married next year.There's plenty of fish in the tinder sea, but if you use a shallow lure with whore bait, don't be upset when you catch some stinkers. 
Dont use the app
I loved this.  I'm beginning to seriously date a girl on tinder and she says things every now and then that make me realize she was NOT just hooking up with people. first night she came over to my apartment she said something along the lines of, "well we skipped the actual date and now I'm at your house. haha this is an unusual tinder date." I laughed and agreed all the while in my own head thought, "the only thing atypical here is I'm not inside you and I actually enjoy what you have to say." so....things are going well. but it can definitely be used to both ends. 
My buddy met his long-term gf on Tinder. I think it was a terrible decision, but so far she hasn't cheated on him, so maybe he knows something I don't.
I disagree that the shallowness is something new or exclusive to it. I mean, it is not very different from picking girls at a bar/club, you look at the girls and go: "No, No, Maybe, Yes, No... Lets try the "Yes" and then later the "Maybe"" and girls do the same "If THAT guy comes here I'l think about it. The rest are a no".The app just made it much easier and quicker. And people are, usually, more sober. Tough I understand if you refuse to pick girls at bars/clubs too.
Ah, Madison, you missed an opportunity there.
They may be assuming your family or friends are super religious even if you are not. I know, super big assumption that doesn't even make sense and it stupid to begin with. But that may be their (stupid) reason. /u/_afox_  may be correct. Also, he foxbro!
For my money, if she can't realise the superiority of Mogadishu then she deserves a beheading.
Eh every ahmed and Mohamed that i know is muslim, so its not the craziest assumption. Then again I also have a muslim name, but have long since left religion.
Womp womp :(
> Difficult truths are a lot more palpable than bullshit rationalizationswe can say that about both sides
Wait, where (approximately) do you live, OP? This is a lot more surprising if it's happening in Turkey than if it's happening in Texas.
His race didn't change though, I would wager to say that culture and religion probably play a bigger part in people rejecting the OP as Ahmad but not as Nick. 
As another comment said, his race hasn't changed, just his name. That makes me think it has less to do with racial profiling and more to do with cultural profiling.
Living in a multicultural society doesn't mean the cultures within it will like the other culture, or that suddenly personal preferences no longer matter to the person.
Well, Muslims on the whole tend to be more devout than your average Christian. The average American who identifies themselves as Christian doesn't even go to church with any kind of regularity if at all. Whereas the average Muslim is a lot more hardcore about it which is where the difference lies. 
I used to teach in South Korea.I had a student named Kim Jong Un, same as the current North Korean dictator. Not a nice coincidence.
Ya of course you can! Just be pro brown and advocate for your brown friends. Like if you go out and you get a shittier seat in a restaurant or worse service, just call them on that shit. Your reward is access to brown mom home cooking omg like wow. 
Have you met any of these girls? Are you gonna answer as nick or tell them your real name? no judgement just curious haha
Yeah I know, I feel like I'm nuts at some of the lack of awareness I see here. People basically saying "Oh no, it's probably just because they just associate some negative stereotypes they have about Muslim people when they saw your name or they get uncomfortable around foreign people, it's not racism!" and I'm like "Um, that's exactly what racism is?"
Yeah true, but CasualConversation is generally a lot nicer people on average, so it was just a little disappointing is all.
I'm sorry to say, but if I was you, I'd change my name.Hell I did change my name to something that's pretty close to John Smith for this exact reason.
I'm going to elaborate a little bit, and hopefully not construe the point you or /u/Geofferic are making:Even if OP isn't Islamic, or Muslim, there's still the idea that he most likely comes from a family that may have that faith.We also know that most Middle-Eastern families *tend* to want their children to be in relationships with other Middle-eastern significant others. That being said, I don't blame girls for not swiping right. You live in a Western Society and are foreign (especially from the Middle-East given the current Global Climate), you're going to get less matches.
I was wondering if we could see any pics...ya know for science :')
Are you the guy who reads those online applications that make you re-fill out the  information after your resume has been uploaded in addition to a 50 question personality test?
And that is? ^^genuine ^^question, ^^dunno ^^what ^^you're ^^talking ^^about
Is it discrimination if they make more money with women? Seems like a business choice to me. 
My name is Charlene but I go by Charly.  My resume and business cards say Charly and only things like cheques and benefits say Charlene for processing.  I've never had a problem with it.  I'm sure if you make up a completely different name it may cause some confusion but there was an example a few months ago where "Deandre" hated his name for job-hunting.  Everyone told him to use either "Dean" or "Andre" instead.

Go for the long con
Met the girl I'm lying next to right now via Tinder.We met outside of a bar at 2:30 AM and went back to my apartment after to rip more shots and get after it.But that was two years ago. And now we live together.Can't say I was searching for that on Tinder, but it worked.
> Doesn't smoke That's legit. Smoking is disgusting, and Idk if I could ever actually date a smoker.
By your logic, everyone on tinder are shallow assholes who'll cheat on their SO. 
pretty simple answer here, most people aren't looking for the most stimulating experiences
I was thinking Ahmy. 
and you know what's the most ironic/contradictory part?these same 'sarcastic' girls show zero indication on their entire profile that they're either humorous or sarcastic.and, when you give a humorous or sarcastic reply, they act offended and have next to zero sense of humor (mind you, im not sending anything insulting/offensive to them).i love it!
Ahahahahaha can we be best friends?
Eh, it's awfully silly of you to say someone is stupid for saying "Mohammad Fasikh Hussain" just **MAYBE** might possibly be a Muslim. I won't date plenty of girls if they're too Christian, Catholic, or wayyyy too into any one religion, it represents who they are, and if there were any one religion that can take things a bit too seriously I would imagine it's the one that I've known to have excommunicated their child for dating outside of their religion. 
I agree. I'm frustrated that people in this thread are trying to bullshit their way around facing racism and I'm also frustrated that shitty brown dudes make it harder for those of us who aren't.
He's in Toronto, from Afghanistan. 
I went on two dates, and have actually told one that my real name is Ahmad, i use nick as my nickname. She was okay with it. I am going to meet this Thursday for drinks . 
It's diet racism for sure If they were Japanese and named Fukasaki or Chinese and name Li-Chi-Pi it would likely end up the same assumption, does this person within reason have the same North American ideals as me, its like a 5 second tinder bio you have to homogenize yourself and they can't be sure. So they swipe. 
Haha, no human sees those applications if you don't score high enough on that personality quiz. 
It's largely a matter of zeitgeist. Unlike for women in tech or military, nobody cares about men who want to become massage therapists. 
I was preparing for an Archer reference
In my area all the girls have "no hookups" in their bio. I hate the south
I don't understand why. ELI5?Does it match you with friends of friends (no thank you) or does it data mine your facebook interests/likes (I have left everything blank...)
I like this. Hire Caucasian actors as parents. Legally change your name. Put Nick on your tombstone. She will never have to know. The swipe is all that matters.
"Why do people call you Nick? Is Nick an Arabic name? You don't look like a Nick."
I think that's a pretty innocent lie, considering many people think they know height better than they do. E.g. Girls thinking a guy under 6ft is too small for them when really 5'10 or 5'11 is taller than they think, probably because many guys that height will have said they're 6ft to sound cool.  I can understanding him wanting to ovovercome an initial rejection based on what can just be prejudice - your cousin's case is different. I don't really see what's so weird about what was probably insecurity, nor her ability to laugh off a white lie.
I do. But for *your* girlfriend. 
He's saying he's getting swiped left because he doesn't smoke.
Yeah but it's a process to get a passport. If I hadn't been planning a trip about anyway then I wouldn't have a passport now. What's the point in going through the effort to get one if you weren't preparing to leave anyway? 
I thought that was pretty much ALL they were looking for.
I spent 7 yeahs in the ahmy.
can we make a club? 
I'm not saying it's a conscious reaction. It's most likely subconscious.Also I know plenty of girls who look for relationships through tinder (I was one once as well), which is why I was speaking from a personal point of view, but since I'm guessing neither of us are tinder experts, neither of us should make generalizations about what the average girl is looking for. 
I'm from Toronto, it's still not surprising.
Well im one of those people. I speak Urdu, language of Pakistan. Now growing up on it, thinking and listening to its songs, its part of my identity and huge aspect of my life. Now when seeing a causaian person huge aspect of my life, humor is what my partner cant grasp. Im not saying that if i find a perfect white girl im gonna say no to marrying her but culture/language is very important to me so what you said can be reasoned with my ideology
I mean, it also kiiiinda seems like OP's assuming they'd swipe right *just* because he's from the same region too..
I'm part Polish, and what I find strange is that when my great grandfather came over to the US from Poland, he shortened our last name by three letters, but kept the "sky." It was only 9 letters long to begin with, and really easy to spell and pronounce. I never understood the point. 
nice, good luck
What's up with the weird green 'thebutton' dot next to your name?
My issue with those is that some of them ask for your job duties and then only give you 140 characters to answer it. I literally can't fit my relative duties there. So I'm left with stating my title and type of position and then saying "see resume for additional details, not enough characters" or something like that.It's infuriating. 
Well, yeah that IS a smart business choice. But that is why government regulation has to step in. As far as I'm aware there are no laws requiring massage therapists to be split evenly between men and women. 
Ohhh believe me, it's a lie. That's a get out of jail free card for when people that know them find their profile.
The authentication system they use involves Facebook's token and they didn't use a homegrown account system.
In a similar vein I think there was a post a while back about a guy who faked being Jewish with his wife's help so the in-laws would approve, and managed to get his parents to fake being Jewish at the wedding
Well Jake is a pretty great name.
It's a *Nick*name
I'm almost 5' 9". I had a guy once tell me he was 5' 11". While he was standing next to me. And I was looking at the top of his head. (Not wearing heels, either.) 
Good, take her
I think it shows that it's something you're looking forward to. A passport is good for 10 years. If a person can't save enough in 10 years to go somewhere that you need a passport (they even recommend taking it to Canada these days), to me that's not a person who wants to travel internationally.
Likes: positive stimuli, resting periods  Dislikes: negative stimuli, waking periods, extinction
You must be Ames
Paging /u/pandoras_fox
I'm a white Christian American. I lived in Morocco for 5 years and married a Moroccan. We don't have the same cultural references... and life is still awesome. :)
Could it be misspelling by the documentation people or did the pronunciation change? I know that when some irish families came over to England their names got written down misspelt or even anglicised. For example variations of the same surname like Caldwell, Coldwell, Cauldwell
Okay, but then all the more reason to not assume that a young Canadian Muslim you meet is super devout and culturally incompatible with you.
I guess. All I'm saying is that it sucks being on the receiving end of those negative snap judgments all the time.
It's flair!Lots of subs use flair to mark certain users or divide the community into subgroups. r/AskScience and r/AskHistorians members use it to advertise their areas of expertise; r/xxfitness uses it as a way to advertise one's preferred exercise; a lot of competitive subs use it to track and mark participation/accomplishments. CC just uses it for decoration, though, and a lot of other subs do as well.
And they choose not to add Google, Twitter, LinkedIn or others. 
Having spent some time doing web app development, I can say with relative certainty that Facebook integration is relied on as a quick way to get the personal information that the app depends on -- like your name, photos, social connections, etc -- without having to explicitly ask for them. Using social media authentication is also great for the user, being as they won't have to set up yet another account, verify their email, or remember which password they used, all of which generally turn people off from using new services.
Yeah, cause there are no creepy rapists on Facebook.   I avoid using any free service where my personal info is the product.  I don't sell plasma or pimp myself for medical experiments either, just a personal standard. So yeah, no tinder for me.  
This is what i though, too. But I have seen a couple of friends of mine show up and they said i did for them too. Go figure. 
this was most definitely a movie
I know some guys that would disagreer/antijakes
A fake name you give girls at the bar.  Ron Mexico, Carlos Danger, Jake...
*I'm hiding from the Jihad* was going to be my explanation.
"Take my wife. *Please*."
> they even recommend taking it to Canada these daysIf by "recommend" you mean "turn you away at the border without one" then yeah... You need a passport to get just about anywhere outside the U.S.
Heck I'd swipe right on that one.  Add in *white chocolate chip cookies* and I'd even let you be on top.
Foxbros! :D
By and large, yeah, you will: Statistically speaking, you'll find folks from India are sleeping with other folks from India more than they are folks from Ireland. 
Every middle-eastern friend I had growing up in Toronto identified as Islamic, and prayed five times a day. So...yes, I would (rightly, from what I've experienced) *assume* they do practice Islam.
LinkedIn for Tinder would be awful.
I pass on every single website that requires me to sign in using FB. I have a FB account, but just no. 
Nobody said it was 100% effective, or meant to be, but it requires a Facebook and a verified (non-VOIP) SMS #. It cuts down on the spam and fake accounts that plague OKCupid, and helps keep out some of the stupid creeps. It also shows you friends in common, workplace (now, I think), & interests in common w/ your matches. 
Ahahahaha wtf is this?/r/ofcoursethatsathing I guess
No. My name is actually Jake and I fucking hate that commercial, because half the people I meet say "like Jake from State Farm!"
But...why would you do that?
Err, how is this comment logically valid at all? You sleep with people who are physically near you, and you'll prefer to sleep with more attractive people around you, but that doesn't mean you find them to be the most attractive people in the world. To put it another way, your celebrity crush is probably hotter than your real-life crush, but you're not sleeping with your celebrity crush anytime soon.
Don't you check someone's earning potential before sexing them?/s
That's why I have a fake Facebook account for Tinder. Works like a charm.
I'd bet my saving that the picture is from Seinfeld, altough I can't quite recall what episode, but I can confirm that George Costanza would be in it for the long con and would do more for less.
Yeah of course it is. Jake is the reason for all the miseries in the world 
That commercial ruined my life. Wait, no I ruined my life. But I still hate that commercial. 
You're famous.  You're infamous.  You look famous.  You want to stay anonymous.  You want to just be a different person for the night. Lots of reasons.I did it because Jake Gyllenhaal and I sorta looked alike at the time and people would come up and ask me if I was him or if I was related to him.    It helps that these people were almost always drinking in a dark club or bar.
George converted to the Latvian Orthodox Church for a girl because her parents wouldn't approve of their relationship otherwise. It's a classic. 
Fuck jake.
Yeah I have several friends named some varient of Caitlin. I'm glad there is no variant (that I'm aware of) for my name, that'd be a whole new world of annoyance!And don't worry you didn't know.
Yeah. I won't lie...for a guy who's shy and put himself out there to ask to hang out with the friends, it didn't feel good for them to just brush me off several times. But... whatever. They weren't worth making friends with anyway then, and frankly, I probably had more fun snooping around by myself than they did. 
Agent schnebly5 reporting in. I've snuck past the guard and am in the elevator. As I am writing this the elevator stopped and two women got in. They don't seem to be concerned, just a weird look since I'm in a tux. Will report in soon. On the 5th floor. 
Can't tell if you're sarcastic. It's either this or sitting by myself. Remember, this is her prom, not mine. I go to a different school, so I'll have my own prom with people I onow
She's dancing somewhere with her friends. I can't find her and don't wanna dance enough to find her. 
Too hard in a tux 
Unfortunately my gf didn't have the same enthusiasm towards the mystery of the red ladder that I did... We ended up leaving a little while after my last update when I heard a guy behind the door. I hope to visit the hotel again with another agent and uncover the secrets that lie within it. 
It's an American high school tradition where students dress up in their best and have a blast dancing and what not.  They vote for Prom King & Queen and it's generally a big deal for people to go to at least once.
Hey dude/dudette you can explore a hotel anytime you want! Most people just end up sitting around at prom, so don't regret not going. 
:D I'm sure you are too! 
Hopefully I'll find her sooner rather than later!
So you're saying it gets you...   ... Alotta Fagina? 
Already did after prom ;)
That sounds exactly like the kind of thing I'm hoping to do in college 
Go for it, Agent! Pick up where I left off.
I do play ingress!
Oh shit maybe those security guards were called by the red ladder guy!! In that case I was a pretty fucking slick agent. 
I have to report back to command
Aww thanks :D that means a lot! Have an awesome day! 
Thanks :( 
I have the same personality type as Butters: INFP!
You know it!
See Edit Number 2 - his girfriend got 'the package'
Have fun buddy!
Thanks--I sure hope so! 
We didn't stay, but I assume if you book a room you can. Never heard of anyone doing that. I stayed over at my girlfriend's house.!
No! This is Patrick!
I hope so :D
I KNOW!!! I NEED TO GO BACK AND FIND IT!!! Also, really thank you for your positive vibes... it's just kind of dizzying right now cause the breakup is a bit messy here and there so it takes some work to close. I really hope you're right about college. If I may ask, are you in college? 
Slightly creepy but thank you!
Ha! I thought of that while I was snoopin'. 
you know me too well! thanks for reading and glad you liked it. 
Thanks for the kind words! I sure hope you're right!
Wow! Awesome! Let me know what you come up with! 
I've decided not to make any public remarks about where it is for privacy purposes, but that's fucking awesome nonetheless!
Fellow agent, one of the keys to being stealthy and going places you're not supposed to is the ability to retreat. In my adventures in the hotel, I had a few "safe spots" where I *knew* nobody would find me (e.g. this little nook on the F1 staircase on the 6th floor). So each time I went a little further in the ladder room and sensed danger, I knew I had a place to fall back to. It's like guerrilla warfare. 
I dunno... Depends on the mission 
You'll find more awesome people like you in college/uni. Let those high school snobs be
It's a kind of cracker I think. Threw me too, the first time I heard an American say that.
beware of the two ladies, they must not find out your true identity :D!
Yo, as someone who never went to prom... I doubt you'll regret anything. Life is so much better after high school in my opinion.
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful memory with me. :-)
Darn. What about the roof? Ha. Don't take me seriously. 
Good on you. :) my best friend's high school had a strict "your days has to be of opposite sex". What always happened is that all the same sex couples would invite other gender couples as their dates. 
Hey, America shouldn't be giving out its secrets to other spy agencies 
You can't just make assumptions
Thank you for sharing too and my pleasure!! I think it's a lesson you've probably got the hang of anyways ;).
Thanks for your well-wishes! Indeed, it was a lot of fun, and the friend I was mentioning and wife were both key parts of it. I'll be hanging on to them for life :). 
Thank you.
...with your girlfriend?
Lol when's ur birthday
The cafe ladies were not stoked when we wandered in 5 min before closing tripping hahahhahahaha 
Dresden Files....MBTI...INFP(like me).....audiobooks? Y'all're mah internet buddies who I'll never really talk to. :DD
Reading this after your last edit (Sorry for that bro...) makes me think you should contact that gal ;)
I'm 2 years out of college. It was the best experience of my life!
I'll do that!! ;D
Thank you for the tip. I'll deliver pics of the bounty if I am successful.
I just realized what uni meant from your comment. I feel like an idiot
I'm going into my junior year, think there's still hope for me? Side note: I'm 32, will that be a problem?
Delicious, cheesy, goldfish shaped crackers.
Reporting in. Close call! Saw a room service lady on floor 5 and then on floor 6. She gave me weird looks. I ran up stair E and then stair G to floor 8 where I am now. I think I lost her. I see a sign for "roof access" so I'm going to check it out. 
Good to hear cause high school...hasn't been the most fun thing I could imagine. 
Read above. I think the red ladder may have led to the roof. 
ROFLCOPTERUhm... Do people still say this?
Clearly with the mystery person at the top of the red ladder.
Well after the toaster is done toasting, the toast comes up
Good point. He could be bluffing. 
hehe that's how it goes nowadays
Yeah I was too lazy to type it all out. That's why I only went to college and not uni :P
I want to impregnate your brain and get a little schnebly-attitude baby that just goes around everywhere with your mindset. Seriously, that advice is the ultimate key in theory but its really difficult to put it into practice as you said, but still, if you managed to snag a girl from another school then it must've worked, heh. Bestest of luck my friend, hope I meet a schnebly one day <3 
Worked for the Fonz.
We get all the good exclusives. 
If there is no helicopter at the roof waiting for you, they have found us out and you must stay hidden D:!
Left high school 12 years ago, remember precisely nothing about it or what happened there. Moved away, got actual friends, got a proper job. Life starts after education.
Because, I went to homecoming... I imagine prom has the same shitty DJ, with the same shitty people, with the same shitty awkwardness. From what I can tell, prom was like the tutorial to proper partying.
I dunno man, at least 4... maybe even 5.
I think the radio waves door was too the roof. There are signs similar to that on the door to the roof of my apartment building. 
It's fairies. 
The only proper attire if you want to morph into a tiger and still be modest later on. 
Haha you're awesome! Biggest smile/laugh I've had today. Best of luck to you too! Schneblies are a rare breed, but with enough dedication, I'm sure you could join our ranks. 
Except our chocolate. Fuck our chocolate. 
OH SHIT HUGE ENCOUNTER. So I just took stair F1 up to floor 9 and found an unmarked door. Walked in and it had a dirty room with construction materials. Clearly not somewhere where guests are supposed to go. In there, there was an alarm locked door and a tiny unmarked side door with a lock. It was unlocked. I slowly opened the door and I shit you not there was nothing but a red ladder that led up to an office of some sort. I heard the rustling of papers and bolted. The first door slammed shut unfortunately. Currently hiding on floor 6 stair E. Should I pursue the office again? 
Sadly I get this reference.
Me too minus the friends. Have discovered I hate people. 
Hope I have a similar experience! 
Meh, it was fun considering the young age. Maybe you just had "shitty" high school experience.
Unitards - for the weirwolf who has nothing to hide, but still wants to.
HERSHEY'S #1 DAW
Pursue immediately, Agent.  
It's about surrounding yourself with people you hate slightly less than everyone else.
High school is where everyone tries to find any possible reason to bully anyone else to cover up and compensate for their own insecurities.  If they can't find anything else, they will bully you because of how you tie your shoes.  Get done with it as quickly as you can, don't pay any attention to what anyone else thinks, and move on to somewhere with people who will care.
I lived on my own through high school, explored a massive campus, got into lots of legal trouble for "hacking", and lockpicked doors to find a solid crawlspace that connected the boys and the girls dormitories.I had a kickass high school experience, but university is infinitely better in my opinion (all of this is just opinions anyways).
Yeah, what you just replied was what I was thinking, that it just shows a lack of chemistry. For someone who can do something fun and spontaneous like that, you can find someone who would much rather become a secret agent than dance with friends. Seriously, if one of my friends was doing that, I'd probably ditch most activities to join in.
Not all girls are secretly thirsting after guys all the time. She wanted to dance with her girlfriends, and that's fine. She shouldn't have abandoned me, but that doesn't mean she wanted to be off with other guys. 
He had too much hype but I also dont think your team had the right system for him.  Good luck though.
I bolted down all the way to the lobby. I popped out near the prom and scared the bejesus out of two guys when I popped out. Currently making my way back to floor 8... Will report soon about the red ladder room. 
you should get :D! on a t-shirt. really though.
I truly hope so. Thank you for the kind words. 
And I do thank you for that viewpoint. Trust me, I take all this advice into account, but I take it with a grain of salt. Ultimately, I'm the only one who knows the situation in its entirety. 
You are the most mature high schooler I've ever seen! All these people assume so many things about a person based on two sentences. Glad you have your head on straight! Best of luck at you own prom and future mission Agent Schnebly5.   
We anticipate your report with great...anticipation.  And eagerness.
Haha, reminds me of Denko and stupid f*cking hamster face!
Aww man the feels
Very much appreciate the offer but its ok, get yourself a game and thanks alot!:)
I feel like there's a deeper meaning to this that I'm just not getting (ignoring the fact that it's random words)
If you expect nothing you will never be disappointed. I've been following this motto since I was ten
I'm in my early 20's & I've already got a gray. :(I call it Gandalf.
Thanks! People here are so nice
thanks for the cake, it's so good xD
It was Super Smash bros for the 3ds :P and thanks alot!:)
Thanks! A friend of mine has a birthday real soon, I'll try make his birthday awesome
Thanks amigo
Happy Birthday! 
My first Christmas away was tough too.  I went into severe depression because I felt alone in the city/world.
Hell yeah! 
Thank you very much! 
Thanks! :)
Haha thank you!
Thank you!!
Super Smash Bros
Aww, I love you though!:D
3DS Super smash bros
Thanks man, hopefully next year will be better :P
Good enough for me ;) Thanks:D
Thanks stranger!
I feel your pain. My birthday is on Christmas Day :(
<3 Thank you british guy, much appreciated :D
I imagine it's more about the lack of thought from friends and family. More about the lack of presence than the lack of presents.
dude it totally is. Hey slurred!
Haha I have plenty of games believe me. PM your Steam name to me and I'll see what I can come up with. Can't have you presentless.
Oh sorry....haha, a sunset is way more beautiful :)
Looks like Florida to me..lol
Well hello u/kaunis I love meeting fellow bread lover, how are u today?
Perhaps saying something like, I know it's empty but I should make the best of things, like this birthday! 
Me too :happy birthday to my house and the successful capturings of all of the war generals. 
Pessimism is the new optimism
If you except nothing you won't be depressed because you expected that. 
Nice name. I called mine "Bitch Ass Motherfucker". Surprisingly, no more have showed up since that day. But Bitch Ass Motherfucker seems to stick around...
Actually, there is no "grey hair," only pigmented and white.  The term "grey" comes from the appearance of pigmented and white blended together.  As you age, you have less pigmented hair, so the overall appearance becomes whiter.
One of the keys has 3 games in it ;) (ops, I mean 6 games in total)Let me know if you were able to redeem them just fine.
A Hawkeye fan? :O I love Hawkeye
Hawkeye? Iowa?? go Hawks dude :)
I guess this would be a bad time to suggest playing some Portal, huh?
Did you ever end up getting it? I have a 25$ gift card to amazon if you didn't end up buying it yourself. It's not the full game but it'd be much cheaper!
That's the spirit! Hope the rest of your weekend is awesome!
The most adorable killing machine. I love him.
Till you guys meet up with the neighbors to the west! Happy birthday man!
No, it's fine, really. Life deals people different hands, and this is the one I have played with all along. Some people have big parties, I appreciate another day.
Shit man, this makes me want to send you my copy. If I had the money, I'd do it.
RemindMe! December 25 2014 "Tell /u/LaChatteNoire Happy Birthday!"
You are awesome! The world needs more people like you :-)
So the question is, where did you take a brief survey that earns you a $50 Amazon gift card?
South Afr actually....Good guesses,  just a little to high ;)
Yup! It's kind of sad, but I feel like I'd rather go into a situation expecting the very worst and being surprised than hoping for the best and being disappointed.
I think I need tattooed to the inside of my eyelids
It's a reason to celebrate, that just happens. People like celebrating.
yeah but that is depressing
Self fulfilling prophecy!
Isn't it hair pigmentation primarily genetic? But yeah, I've had a pretty stressful couple of years recently so either one explains my little wizard.Just look at it as your body adjusting to how wise you are hahah
oh, well again thank you SO SO SO much, like SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much! xD I appreciate it alot! the world needs more people like you
The gentleman of the Joes
Howdy from a neighbor across the river! See you guys on thanksgiving ;)
/u/hawkeye1515 needs to see this!
OPLS.... Deliver!
real mature of you dude. Not many people may value your birthday, but I guarantee people respect you. If you become the type of person that's worth being a friend of you'll find yourself with friends in notime.
Haha well thank you :) that's really kind. 
Thank you :) 
Yeah I'm pretty interested in that haha
Are you Lil' Wayne?
Read Chris Hadfield's 'An Astronauts Guide to Life on Earth'It has a chapter about the benefits of negative thinking, and it's really interesting.
Like every year :\
It can be either. Mine is definitely life related!
Haha, thanks! I'm glad you liked, enjoy your new games :)
This is what I usually associate with Hawkeye. Mmm... Riza... Mustang is a lucky son of a gun.
Dude respect the boomerang arrow.
Ski-U-Mah to both of ya
I second theseeker's opinion. now fruzz go make GabeN release half life 3.
Hey there! 
Which games? Just curious! 
Shank 2, Super meat boy, braid, Lone Survivor, Binding of Isaac and Bastion
Bastion is so good.
Bastion is soooooooo good.
Is Bastion any good?
HelloI had a nightmare last night and I woke up having a sinus lol and I woke up late.But I didn't want to ruin my day because of that and forget about my blessings so I just wanted to be happy. I also have lot of things to do today so if I'm not in good mood I won't be able to do them.
There is always time for a nice change. It's gonna change trust me.Thank you (:
You made me happyThank you 
It will for sure. I woke up today sick and I had a nightmare but I didn't want to ruin my day because of that so I started my day by smiling. And I believe that if you smile for people, which is free of charge, you may change someone's day and make him happier
Best of luck Do not overthink about thatJust try your best. You can do it
LolYou already did and still hope that you're having a good day 
Thank you

I did, thank you

My day is going well. It's a normal day for me I Hope that tomorrow you'll wake up with a positive energy 
Well that's good to know that you day went better (:
Don't say thatI could be worse
Ofc you don't really care. That's normal cause I'm a stranger to you. But I think that you could have been nicer while posting a comment or maybe just ignore it and don't make a comment at all isn't it? Cause I'm sure that you wouldn't like to see someone talking to you that wayAnyway whatever made you angry, I hope you'll pass through it
i have so much to do today, i'm in a fairly good mood, but still don't want to do anything :( any tips, OP? 
That's really positive of you :) Certainly look up to your actions and for the very few people that see this. I believe darker days exist so that the sun can shine brightly on others :) 
Thank you :) hope you had a great day. 
you are welcome
Oh ya, cat is just fine. Cats do that sometimes. Especially where there's carpet. And when you can't reach them in time to get them to the trash can or toilet or something.
I was teasing :) it's been a while since you originally posted, how did your day end up going? 
Oh my gosh!  Just holding my morning pint of tea, which is lukewarm as it always takes an hour to drink it, lol!
In an odd one. Australia. 
5 is usually just when I get tired of trying to fall back asleep but I'm up at 6 every morning whether I want to be or not. My brain is just wired that way. 
Yep! And both my bosses are on it which is nice because I don't get any crap for leaving early 
I hoped a sunny individual like yourself could see the humor in my comment! :D
Very strong painkiller
it went well, thanks for asking :)
Thanks! we're gonna go get lunch and walk around a nice little village area and chat, theres a lot of cool little shops and stuff, I don't have any hard set plans other than where we're eating. but I do want to pet the cat at the bookstore
Aww, well I'm glad. I'm not sure why, but I'll take it. :)
I wanna read out the contents of the L1 cache of ARM processors (specifically of an A53) to check whether certain properties that are of interest to a kernel hold at runtime.
I'm just hoping to find out why my lymph nodes have been swollen for 2 months. Thanks for your well wishes!
Nope. I got it sorted. I had to go to the website rather than use the app and put in my PayPal details. Got a bunch of things listed and we shall see how they shake out. 
They know the time difference because their dad has been out here for years, he just wasn't thinking. This family in general is very impulsive.
Just focus on summer projects and try and find some work experience before starting my masters (audio engineering).What's your final-year project on?
I hope you're having a good day!
Thank you! :D
It turned out really good, so I'm quite happy at the moment. Thanks by the way!
Its okay! How was your day?
thanks! Just arrived. how is your day going so far?
I'm still a little sore, but I feel good enough to do things again (but not playing Overwatch. Tilts me too hard)
Thanks :) I'm making some toast as I type this. 
Haha, yay.
You're welcome. :)
You're a good human being!
Relax lol 
It's a good thing trust me You have to keep in mind that no matter what happens it could be worst. 
Hahaha yea with a running nose lol
Thank you 
Thank you. Yes I had. I hope you had a great day too
It ended up very well, thank youActually I haven't done much, but the fact that I woke up with a positive energy and seeing that many people have responded in a positive way on my post made my dayI just woke up and it's a new day nowHow's yours going so far? 
Hahaha I'm glad I found someone with same attitude as me 
It wasn't much hotI hope that both of us can wake up early someday lol
Does being in Australia significantly effect how you interact with internet people?  Day and night being switched compared to most people.  Opposite seasons.  Do you get movies and tv shows at the same time as everyone else?
I can't even wake up at 9 lol
That's cool
You're welcome
Sounds like a great time, good luck!
I couldn't understand any word lol I feel stupid
That's great (:
It's about using fiber optic sensors for irrigation (agricultural engineering) All the best luck for you 
Yes it was a good day. Thank youIt's 2am now so it's a new dayI hope you had a good day too
It was good, thank youI'm off to bed now Goodnight
I'm glad you're safeMy day went very well it's almost 3am nowI have to sleep lol
Hope it gets better
So yesterday went well. It was an easy day at work, I found out what my bonus was going to be, in general had a pleasant day. And then I played over watch,  and it stopped being pleasant XD But now it's a new day, I just woke up, and it's Friday so it's pretty much the weekend! 
Thanks for the good wishes, I think it's going to go well :) (its going to crash and burn now lmao)
Some computer stuff that will only interest other computer people, I guess ;)
That's interesting. I attempted to build an autotune from scratch
Sadly I'm still at work. You stay up late!
No way! You got this! (Of course, you gotta report back after the fact now!)
I don't understand these stuffMy major is a way far from yours
Yea I was helping my sister preparing herself for a project presentation for tomorrowShe wasn't ready yet
it went well :D I'm a dummy and didn't go for the kiss though lol rip, I'll get it next time
What is your major?
Glad it went well!!! First date is the hardest, lol, you're good from here!
Agricultural engineer 
Cool! How is it?
i was curious if this would be top level comment
Class is almost over, I'll update when I do it
Word for word: "Hey crush how was your spring break?""It was great luke, how was yours?""Pretty good. Hey I was wondering if you'd want to hang out sometime? Like not at school but maybe go do something fun?""What do you mean?""I'm asking you out, do you wanna go on a date sometime?"Pause, she started blushing"Yes"The rest I don't really remember I was too excited
I honestly have no clue. Probably bowling or mini golf or just dinner
You sound like my mom whenever I go out with friends lol
I'm not sure yet, but someone on here suggested the zoo and that sounded perfect
"Nice shoes. Did your dad buy them?" Haha, cracked me up thinking of OP saying that. 
Nothing yet. I forgot what happens after you get a yes hahaha
I do really like this girl, and I'm not gonna try to hide that. I know how to handle myself and not come off as clingy or desperate.
Unless she latches on to your honker.
You do have them. Everyone does, you just have to want it bad enough
Haven't decided yet, but probably something like mini golf or the zoo
1. Smile a lot2. Ask her questions so I don't talk the whole time3. Be charmingNah lol I don't know yet. Still considering a few ideas, but probably the zoo or mini golf
She actually came up and did the "Hi!" thing to me. I hadn't even noticed this girl until she did that and every day since that day we've talked more and more. It works, you just have to be relaxed about it. I know what it's like to talk to a girl you know very little about yet are completely infatuated with. Stop acting like you're defusing a bomb, and just relax. 
I think she likes who I am. I'll just be that
It went great. I'm not gonna make an update post, just because I'd rather not put our entire relationship out here but yeah it went well. 
I'm the his, I asked out a her. 
You've got this.
Nice one for the bluntness haha I think its nice not guessing 
Mini golf is good. As long as you don't get easily frustrated that is, mini golf is hard  
That's actually a great idea. Just make sure to check out the weekly forecast and pick a day with nice weather. I don't know where you're from, but we're in the 90s this week.
What if her dad is a shoemaker?
I think it's a great idea, because of the implication...
Sure thing..Another thing..  Make sure you can fart in front of each other!! You need to have that level of comfort! That was also our first date.. tickle fights and fart contests..11 years since our first date. 
Oh man! I bet the first step was nerve-racking. Good luck, I really hope it goes well :)
It's just so... awkward to me to do that. I can't help but feel nervous about walking up and saying hi, I feel like I need an excuse, you know?I'll definitely just try to relax myself. I don't know how, but I guess I'll try?
Sounds like you have a good plan. Also much better worded than my comment!
A man with principles. Good for you!
In a few months, she'll move from Germany to England, and I don't think I'll be able to see her again
Whooo^ooooo^oooo^s^hGood on ya OP!
Haha yeah I didn't word that one the best
I think he just substituted her name with "crush" and his with "luke" for anonymity's sake. 
Where's the RFC for FboIP
Depends where you know her from. Work or school, talk about work and school. Study together, or talk during a meal break. Small talk doesn't have to be awkward. You can find common interests over time. But make sure you ask her questions she would want to answer, it'll show her you care, because you do care after all. There isn't anything wrong with showing your feelings either. Don't go Ted Mosby and say you love her, but a genuine complement and a little flirting go a long way.
I tend to stress over these things more than the average person. Asking someone out means a lot to me, more than the average guy at least.
"You will meet me later for shots of vodka."
Might actually be a good idea then to see if his crush can handle frustration lol. Good opening test. 
I think Bowling would work well with lunch/dinner. Though mini golf is probably more interactive. Maybe mini-golf as a first date, and bowling and a meal as the second once the ice has been broken.But I just love bowling so that could be me
Also: wear sunscreen and take your own lunch or eat somewhere else because geez their food is pricey (usually).
That's when you take her out on your boat.
 > and not dead 1.5 years laterYou're slacking.
Thats a ballsy move, not sure if I'll do that first date haha
Well, that sucks. The good thing is that you have the courage to put yourself out there and see where things go. You will definitely meet someone else you like in the future and I hear it gets a little easier every time you try.
Doesn't matter, you put yourself out there! That's the hardest part and now you've done it NINE times now. There will always be failures in the sense they may say no but the real failure would be not trying again. I will echo what others have said too. Don't over do it on the first date. Find somewhere nice and quiet where you can talk and get to know each other in a new sense. But overall well done and I wish you all the best! 
I think that he was joking 
Heh. That would be fun to write.     2.1.  Summary of FBoIP Syntax    FBoIPs are defined similarly to URIs in [RFC3986], but their purpose    is strictly for the conveyance of congratulations over other protocols.    FBoIPs support both relaxed (closed fist) and strict (bump explosions)    modes with the latter indicated by making a "boosh" nose and wiggling    the intitator's fingers.
School, same as you pretty much. I'm just dabbling, trying to find someone good. I did at one point but i fugged that up good
Same here dude, having low self esteem doesn't help either. Things like this inspire me to try to get back into the game though. Props
It's from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. 
No "tests". Just observe. OP, no tests. I hate shit tests.
if she rips one, tell her it's ok, it's a human function!
I have no clue yet
That's the thing. If you want to go on a date you got to ask them. If they say no, you move onto the next one.Can't get stuck on one girl for too long because you'll miss out on opportunities that could be literally in front of you.And I need to take my own advice here too.
Lol I was :) 
Hey, rejection happens, all you can do is be like oh well and go for the next one.If you like a girl, just go for it. If she says no be thankful she didn't lead you on, if she says yes, you're one step closer.
I've done that too. She was the perfect package and I passed her up for a bitchy cheater with big boobs. But thats all in the past.Since you know her at school, try inviting her to study or work on homework together. It's a good excuse to have a conversation. And like I said before, don't be afraid to show her how you feel. People like being liked, and if she can guess you like her, it'll help out. 
Just trying to play along :/
If I could offer any advice, my general rule for first dates is don't make it a big, flashy thing. No movie. No elaborate, expensive thing. A first date is meant to talk and get to know one another better. For example, my first date with my wife was to a dessert restaurant where we split some cookies and ice cream, and talked over that. Cost about 5 bucks, if that, and lasted an hour or two. Keep it simple, and if/when more dates happen, then you can start branching out and up.Good luck, and congrats!
It's better to shit your pants than die of constipation
May I remind you that being that forward would totally go against me being quite reserved, but if you don't buy a ticket as they say. Cheers mate, hope it goes all well on your end.
lol this thread is a trainwreck
My husband and I watched a movie in his couch on our first hang out, but we went to dinner and had a proper date as our first date.. mostly because I told him I had never been on an actual date before. He brought flowers and everything. It was amazing. A. Because you can always win me over with good food. B. Because we could TALK. It is so important to get to know who it is you are going on dates with. 
Ugh...you good bro?
Movie followed by dinner isn't terrible since you have the movie to discuss at dinner.
I feel like the purpose of a first date is to talk to your date and get to know one another. It's difficult to do that during a movie.Sure, you can watch a movie and chat after, if that's what you or your date enjoys. I'm sure some people would love that. So maybe it's not necessarily a bad idea, I just don't think it's the best idea when there are other options that are more personable (and less expensive).I say save the movie for later. Get some ice cream or drinks and get to know one another for a bit.
However. This person you just took on a first date, now has to sit with you for 2 hours and not say a single word to you until the movies over. 
maybe netflix and a pizza then?
i actually agree, i was just insinuating the prince of whales kinda has a leg up from the start.
He called her his crush, meaning they've probably got a close enough relationship that they know each other already. Nothing wrong with seeing a movie together
I will when I wake up! she is in bed right now as am I, I just woke up randomly and wanted to put my words into text.
Trouble makers don't ask permission to be bad. They just do it.
WHAT ARE WE TO YOU OP???
When you told her about it, how did you pronounce it? I've read the word Doge so many times but never heard it out loud. 
and I'm Soli, I love ice creams, video games, and boobs.
NO WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
I'll be that one bloke where the family is sizzlin some snags and I come by  and hav em uninvited. Everybody knows that one bloke
Even if she isn't - Happy Mother's Day from the US and /u/tatertot255 internet friends :)
I was thinking the same thing! *sweats* The pressure is on! :)
*Nana internet hug*I'm your friend! :)
Hey there /u/porridgemonster, could we have some free porridge? :)
We wish you both an amazing mothers day and weekend! :)
And one for tatertot255's mother: (::)
I'm not your pal, dude
I'm the Nana friend !*Nana internet hug*
Watch it! *stares*
hi also from South Africa
Hi from Texas also!
Tell her i said hi too! Actually "Hi tatertot255's mom!" 
Another Hi!
Say Hi to SWOOP for me! :)
I'm realizing its a mistake to up-vote everyone while on mobile. :D
Hi from Houston!
He's a polite trouble maker. How dare you?
Oh, we have someone just like that at our school. Tough drummer guy at first, but when you get to know him he's the nicest guy you will ever meet.
*Sends /u/LimesInHell for a time out*
I'm sory but i just see you as a friend.
Love? I guess it's a bit more than friends haha
Husband and I are more into Formula 1 but he does have a Jeep and goes off-roading with our sons, grandson and friends. If you want to come along - bring your Mom of course - he would love to show you a day of mud, water, rocks and Jeep parts (that fall off) :) That's his favorite thing to do with friends :)
and I'm Marm, I love pizza, buffy and butts.
Oh yeah. All good though mate, I'll throw some extra snags on for you ;)
Noooo it's all mine.
*Awkward hot internet hug* :D
I'll tell her for you
You don't want my username on it
Hey man when's your mixtape dropping? 
Beautiful day we're having in NJ, isn't it?
Ya know, I was surprised at how beautiful NJ actually is.  It has an unfair reputation!  
Username definitely checks out.
If we wait a few more minutes it should be snowy Minnesota 
NC Chapel Hill/Raleigh, woot woot!
Make that two howdys, pardner!
Hi from Austin Texas and San Marcos Texas too!
Fellow New Yorker also saying hi
Hi there neighbor!  Plano here :)
Another hi from the Netherlands!
Hampshire hype! Whereabouts are you?
lepo je vreme
Plus one more from Alberta! Hi Mom!!!
Thank you! That made my day. We are ok so far :) 
What can I say? I'm a little stinker.
It's how a *lot* of metalheads tend to be, too.
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP
Can't you love your friends? I do.
I want this to happen. 
Hi marm I'm matt, I like pizza, burgers and porn
You're a top bloke
Awww --- *takes in awkward hug with gratitude*
I'm sure she'd find it weird. Nobody has an Arabic numeral in their names. 
Looks at username *oh dear!*
I love days like this! 
That's because most people that have been in NJ only briefly usually pass through the areas near NYC, which are very industrial, swampy and overall ugly. Not too beautiful today, though... cold and rainy
Had a tour of TCNJ today. Rain was definitely there.
Nah, it's 88 in Minneapolis today.
Greenville, Arrrgh!!!
3! 3 howdys ah ah ah.
Long Island represent!
Nice to meet ya man! Actually in Denton, but I felt Dallas is alot more recognizable.
Is your username a Comedy Bang Bang reference by any chance?!
I love them even when they ask me not to. :)
Smooooooooth
Would be fun! :)
Who doesn't? 
Then you are a person with good taste!
Guys, english please. What are snags?
You sound like you just bottled a hug and put it on a shelf xD... How would a bottled hug look like
Except for /u/tatertot255
Mine would be fine! 
Oh I didn't either when I made my name. I freaking love cherries.
Cold and rainy are my favorite types of days!  It's unfortunate that I live in Texas....
... I mean, NJ sucks.  "Garden State" my ass.  More like "Garbage State", amiright?
And for the next few days too! Good luck!
I thought all the people who responded to "Hi from x-place" was going to your inbox as a response O_O I guess not 
I'm there as we speak. Making a joke mate :P
still NC, give me a high five! 
True!  Denton's lovely, although I haven't been in AGES.  Truth be told, I'd take the West side of the Metroplex over the East any day.  Or at least that used to be true!  I used to live in downtown fort worth, back when it was cool.  (by "cool", I mean "shady as fuck" and not filled with martini bars and overpriced "fusion" restaurants like it is now) :)Get off my lawn.
Of course! I'm actually listening right now.
That's not friendly at all! :)
Where are the fun old people in my area?
I'm Limbo, I love Silicon Valley, Chicken and women with intelligence. *Don't judge me either*.
Best season? Best toppings?BEST BUTT?important information, let's be real
Sausages. Or sensitive new age guys I guess but they don't get put on the barbie generally.
Terrific thank you! The weather is beautiful - blue skies and sunny and in the 60's. Getting some chores done but taking time to fun outside every now and then for a blast of sunshine! Checking in with reddit now and then too of course :)
Mine would not be. 
Oh yeah, it's the worst. The worst at everything. The only thing it's good at is being the worst. And everybody looks and talks like the cast of the Jersey Shore.
Bolton/Delco/Reigelwood here!
Sunny and warm and should be for the next few days..
Knew it! Love that podcast.
It was just a joke :D
They are there - sometimes you have to look for 'em though. :)
I'm Pan, I love Community, Sushi and nerds :)
I can never decide between 2 3 or 5, they're all too good! I might be a bit of a heathen for this, but BBQ sauce instead of marinara with double cheese and donate meat with pepperoni and mushrooms. Best butt would have to be that Pantera chicken who did the amazing twerking video.Same questions back at ya!
Thanks! You're a top bloke
No. At least I don't think so. I'm from the other Australia. The one with the mountains, you know.
It's a nice day today, too. Really beautiful day today
wow never heard of those
Might have to hop on the old hovercraft then!
/r/Portsmouth
I know ya silly rabbit. I was joking backatcha! :) *wink*
I'm Yun, I love video games, cartoons and butts.
Season three is my faaaaave. So many classics in that season. YOOO that pizza sounds amazing (minus the mushrooms, which are basically Satan food), so I'm gonna try that next time. I'm a fan of a good cheese or meat lovers myself. And best butt?? Chris Evans in good pants is up there. 
And the Hobbits? 
It always brings up our spirits when that happens! :)
ooooh --- that would be lovely! :)
North of Southport, west of Wilmington, east of Whiteville, south of Smithfield
Well technically I'm studying in London atm, but I will always be in Portsmouth at heart (and in the summer) :P
Oh, silly me, haha
I'm Dea I like drugs and music :)
Not *that* one. The one with the similar name, not the similar flag.
how you do live at so many places at once?
HA! Must be Silly Day ! :)
I'm FrareBear, I love mac and cheese, music, and those people with odd colored eyes :)
That's a secret, friend.
Ahhhh, yes, the famous Australia in Europe.
you gotta ask now and let us know
I count three wins here.
Thank you, Ezra!
Heck, it's helped towards me GETTING a girlfriend before.
Is she Italian? I bet she's Italian.
When I started dating this one girl, she slammed the crap out of the door when I picked her up for our first date. I did the same thing as OP and pretty much opened the door her every time we got in my car. For two years. *sigh...*
That was traded in, but I have a 2013 Subaru Legacy now.  I'm kind of hooked on Subaru, they've never let me down.
My car's windows are the same way. I just roll them down as I come to a stop when letting someone out (you know, for air) so that they have nothing to push on. 
Well, alright! With my first foray into CC at that.  Happy to be here!
I can think of one or two other things that are wrong with society before this.  Use of the word "peeps" is one of them.
Ha! Turns out he's really a gentleman (whew!). He thinks OP's a genius though! 
Ah yes, I remember those days. Now that we're married, it's a "you might want to crack your window" followed by giggles.
Thank you.
Win win win, we all win
No idea. I didn't even notice that it got so many upvotes
Better than a 59s er
No, no. Larry would just complain to her.
No o_o" Unless this guy lives in New Mexico...
I just like the name Ezra and wish it was mine. My tag though is from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a fantasticle anime.
Glad I could solve the mystery!
I also usually have very long fingernails with all my rings ....
/r/frugal would have a fit if they saw these fat cats just throwing silver around like that.
Nope, she's Indian. Close though,
As am I. Currently have an Impreza and a Forester. Never going back from AWD.
He's totally just telling you that to look like a good person, there must be something he's hiding.
Ah yes, option number 5.
How the hay do you know that?
And George would only say something about it to Jerry after he dropped her off. 
haha no, not only does he not live in new mexico, but if you were him you'd recognise my name anyway :P im not sure why i mentioned it now it seemed relevent at the time... i blame vodka.
I actually just started watching Gurren Lagann, the name caught me off guard, I watched a movie based off of space pirate captain harlock (70's anime) and the antagonist was named Ezra. That sounds a lot more convoluted typed out, wow
Yeah. I was driving my mom to work for a while. Now I have all these scratches under the door handle because of her damn nails! 
BMW 3 #1 for gay men? Where the fuck have you grown up man ... That car is like the default business dude car around here.That said, the Miata was more like the #1 car for male hairdressers back when they launched. Now they're liked by pretty much anyone.
I have yet to see a lesbian subaru owner. I see sport modded subaru all the time. So.... 
I have a Toyota Rav4. I love him, his name is TRav. He has kept me safe for thousands and thousands of kilometres and has recently been gifted a bull bar by the husband. TRav looks like he is wearing knuckle dusters now. But, if not Toyota, I'd have a Subaru, or a Volvo. But Subaru and Toyota are friends. Not like Nissan and Daihatsu, who require being pissed on. 
They did, unfortunately.  
Yeah, reddit agrees. Delete facebook, lawyer up, and hit the gym. Your marriage is OVER. 
Good work everybody!
Just looked through your comments to see if you posted on /r/thebutton and found a comment where you did and went to it.
Vodka's always good. Rum is even better ;3
I believe i have watched the same movie. :3 Gurren Lagann is fuckin' amazing. YOUR DRILL WILL BE THE DRILL THAT PIERCES THE HEAVENS!!!
No, it's just a popular image that someone made for a default Sub and it's spread from there.
Go to Vermont. *Everyone* there has a Subaru, so there's a very good chance that if you meet a lesbian, she also drives a Subaru. 
the whole point of awd is to be great in the snow. and the rain. and loose dirt or mud. basically all slippery road conditions. i drive a subaru in new england and have never had trouble in any of those conditions.
So did you go back to making her open her own doors? 
Standard reddit advice 
Reddit solved another problem? Like that time we caught terrorists!
Haha whoa someone got it?!
No, you just pick your color. The flair colors from the button are in /r/thebutton
Oh...So this is a safe space where we can talk without worrying about colour :)
I'm a whiskey girl myself. Jack honey please! 
Personally I drink it, but to each his own. 
I love it, on Netflix it did something weird though. The first episode was the Japanese dub and every episode past that has been English dub. It's odd
Oh ok. Thanks for the clarification!
Well I finally went and looked up some stuff I  Google for myself, I'm guessing the reason I heard those comments about all wheel is because of just how brutal our winters are up here. Seems that the option for the low gear four wheel is something that the all wheel just can't compete with. In all other scenarios except for rugged mud or deep/unplowed snow, all wheel seems preferred. 
Well, we know for sure that a four wheel definitely does better than a two wheel in the snow, so I guess then that four wheel does better than all wheel in snow as well. Especially where I live, where the winters can get pretty harsh and the plows only really get the main roads. It's important to be able to get around. 
/r/relationships has your back.
is there a subreddit thats like the /r/TumblrInAction of /r/relationships?
Win again! You and all the rest of the people on this thread are why I Fucking love reddit! 
Everybody to the limit, the Cheat is to the limit!
do they have a meaning?
Yup. Color doesn't matter here. People can be any color they want.
I used to drink exclusively whiskey until a few years back when I almost destroyed myself with it. God I miss whiskey =D
That's really weird o-o"
Everybody come on fhqwhgads!
Only if the color you choose has a meaning for you =)
Yay, equality!:)
:D ^:D ^^:) ^^^:|
It's still delicious though. Haha. I'll take "real" straight whiskey as well though, I just like the sweet burn of honey whiskey. 
Don't knowWho it isBut it's probably fhqwhgads
Same here, but no regrets.
So why do you eat lipsticks and lube?
Haha yeah... that's exactly how I feel.
Haha oh god I'm retarded, no I've never had it. Amazing though.
It is delicious, sorry I didn't mean for the comment to be dickish at all lol, its an inside joke with my friends to point out its not really whiskey after anyone talks about honey jack or evan williams honey cause of an all out argument we had about it back before. But sometimes I forget I'm not talking to my friends lol
I asked my friend Joe. I asked my friend Jake.They said it was fhqwhgads! 
Come on /u/MainExport-NotFucks... you're just... makin' yourself look worse, you know? I mean... everyone's gonna feel sorry for you. I do.
I got a pm about this a day ago..are you that person? 
Hahaha that's okay. I don't take offense. I just like whiskey. All kinds. Except Cinnimon flavored. That stuff is gross. 
Yeah, I don't know if they weren't aware or what, it isn't like YouTube has any knowledge of Google /s
oh yes, and the classic whitehouse.com
I think there are plenty of like stories, this one just made me laugh
I work in a bike shop, and was helping a customer track down a replacement part for an old bike rack [for their car] made by Saris.  It took me a little while to realize why a search for "Saris models" resulted in a bunch of pictures of hot Indian women.
Nice, old men are hilarious. 
Thats a classic. Thats a prime example of getting all of the possible URLs for something before you go public with it. That guy resisted a long time in giving it to the government IIRC
Oh man, I'd love to see that reaction video
This story is superior to mine!
You spend a lot of time on the facebook, so I know you know a lot about computers....
Redbox sounds like a very specialised porn site (I'm assuming shark week porn is a thing).
Mine did this too, but with hotmale instead of hotmail
Well played
It didn't help that your screensaver was a game of Ms Pacman
LOL nice. That's amazing. 
Is this an Office reference? 
The problem is, if you show them, and they have trouble grasping those things they'll just end up doing more damage in the long run.
... Who cares if you know what porn is?Also, in the story, the woman opens with the name RedTube the next day, rather than OP mentioning the name first.
Mabel is such a great name
It does do that and it gives you play music
So did you Redtube with her that night? If so... Link?
Yeah with their Racism, Xenophobia, Sexism and ruining out economy and blaming us! No they are adorable though
sans =/= =/=
What are you willing to wager?
They had to have known, personally I think it was a way to get back at them. But it was probably not the best decision at all for YouTube
Red band actually refers to the beginning of the trailer where it says "this preview has been approved  for *blank* audiences". Generally the backgrounds are green, and it says either all audiences or appropriate audiences.Red band trailers have a red background and say restricted audiences. It doesn't necessarily mean that sexual content is involved, but it usually is.
I can't help but think your life is full of tremendous highs and catastrophic lows.  I mean, that kind of native optimism cannot be healthy.
Not before Youtube, but before Youtube red. 
I remember being in the 3rd grade during our computers class. Teacher writes "whitehouse.com" on the board, and that was my first exposure to porn.
I'd guess it was about 5-6yrs ago. Good to see it's changed now.
Gotcha. I obviously didn't check it before I commented, but good to know no more of the same mistakes will be made.
Why is it always Dennis, too? lol
Searching milk bags only finds actual milk bags for me
Magic Actions is awesome! Changing the volume with the scroll wheel is so nice
A lot of standards have phased <> outBut it's so neat!
For future reference, if you're using the default Google keyboard, it's just a long press on the =.
You are a programmer, so you probably know how to install pirated windows 10 on this laptop from the 90s.
That kind of porn is a thing and there's even a subreddit for it if you know where to look. You... PROBABLY don't want to though >_> 
Pretty sure red tube is at least 2007-born. Redox is a thing after 2010 I thought
My screen saver was a playthrough of Leisure Suit Larry.
I know the last time she somehow ended up getting in the HDMI mode of the t.v.
Oh I haven't looked into the music.It's just that I already pay for netflix, spotify, and a few other services. I know everyone wants their own cut but I can't really justify it for YouTube.If their service is better than spotify I'll consider swapping the two tho.
Do you like Allo? Because it is probably next on the chopping block.
lol unfortunately it did not end up being that exciting
Look on the bright side. Most of them rant way more than they do things.
Cringers at full power, Mr. Sulu.
Get back at google or get back at redtube???  What did redtube do to google or whh would youtube want to get back at its parent company?
Well Bing is better for looking up porn.
No no, what sort of self respecting programmer watches smut?!?!?!?
Have they not made that owned by alphabet?So alphabet (which is basically Google but a rebranding for the business people) owns Google which owns YouTube.
Why did the teacher write that on the board?
This was 20 years ago
it was still like that just a year ago
Because he's Dennis the Menace 
And then you get a phone call: "Jimmy, scammerwebsite.com won't load for me. This you-bunt-her stuff is rubbish. I want my internet explorer back! I just want things to work."
Is this due to ALT_GR being more common/already in use on other layouts? RIGHT_ALT was mostly just a duplicate key on most modern systems using en_us keyboards.Or is it simply missing support, which could likely be resolved?
If you don't you're not a very good programmer obviously. Why did you even go to college?
With age, comes wisdom and the knowledge "I really don't need to Google Image Search that".
It's not better than Spotify, but I don't find it significantly worse 
Why would it be? It just came out.
Fair enough
>Mr. SyulyuFTFY
I think the other poster means get back at RedTube. Not that they did anything wrong, but maybe YouTube feels "well, **we** did the whole ___tube thing FIRST." Like a territorial dispute?
And it doesn't steer you away from the really weird parts of YouTube, either.
Definitely not the ones that programmed the websites. /s
What really happened was the teacher said out loud to go to "whitehouse.gov" to the class because we were learning how to do research on the internet or something, but I (and many others) misheard it as whitehouse.com and shenanigans. So I guess my first post was erroneous.
government still doesn't own whitehouse.com
Hahahaha mine (SO's...) is like this too! It's like a child!It's like those lazy kids who can't tie their shoe laces. They're old enough to do it, they have the motor skills, they have a general idea of what's going on... but they keep suckering you into doing it and don't care to learn when you try to show them.
Well, ALT_GR is already in use, and we have neither a / nor a = key, they're created themselves by key combinations.
Assume much, do you? I know how to do it (if the device meets the requirements), I just hate doing it and I am tired of people who expect I will do free service for them. So chill out.I went to college (well, university of technology) to be a programmer not a tech assistant. And I have put that example because most programmers know the pain. "You work with computers? Oh, then fix that shitty full of malware computer of mine for free because this is what you do, isn't it?"
yeah, I only use it with the assistant too. for reminders, mostly
Google wave forever.
Fair point. My take on this election has been that this needs to be our wake-up call to stop being so jaded - it's not like this generation doesn't have opinions or conviction, but we sure do seem to give up easily when it comes to lots of things. I'm not holding my breath, but I am hopeful.
Yugh, jyust the soyund of it...
I highly doubt that.
I do love me some weird YouTube but sometimes it's like hunting for unicorns. You just gotta let it come to you 
I was joking... sorry to trigger you
r/deepintoyoutube is the place for that.
There are websites without porn on them? 
With that it's like hunting caged rabbits. 
(almost) Everything is porn if you try hard enough.
As bad as this is, if we really wanted to get Victoria re-employed /r/gonewild should bite the bullet as wellIMAGINE THE CHAOS
Will your gaming forum still be open?    *senpai don't kill me*
If /r/OutOfTheLoop becomes private we're all doomed. 
I will never do that to you <3
Oh no. How ever will I be able to look at gaming memes and GTA gifs?
May God have mercy on us all...
I appreciate you.
Plz don't leave us ;_;Seriously though, all this shutting down of subreddits means that its actually *harder* for people to get the relevant information. As a means of protest, I kind of feel like its somewhat self-defeating in some sense, as nobody can see *why* they've shut themselves down.
Jebus Christ, I was looking at that subreddit like half an hour ago!
Conspiracy theory right there. I like it.Wait, I mean, I don't like Reddit going dark.
It was summer vacation. The subreddit was up for a little while before it was again made private in protest.
Voat was created long before its ISP shut them down, and they got shut down because they use servers based in Germany 
.....4CHAN.*cries*
I promise I can't do that to you guys.
I was thinking about going out today, but I think I'll just stay home and take in all this juicy drama
Where will we vent the hype!
I dunno, I've seen shitstorms on Reddit before but they've always been just people complaining about admin actions... This on the other hand? /r/IAmA was one of the key components of the Reddit community as a whole. With that gone, and apparently with the likelihood of it being unable to recover? This feels far more serious than the usual controversies. 
Some rumors say that all reddit employees had to relocate to the Bay Area, and Victoria might not have wanted to move from NYC, which is a possibility.
I hate to sound discriminatory, but I'd really rather not associate with Channers. xD Redditors at least can have a decent, mature conversation on the odd ocassion :P
You got banned for being subbed to what subreddit Did they tell you that? 
Basically, it means that only mods and pre-approved members of that subreddit can entire it.For the default subreddits and other major subreddits, it means that for all intents and purposes the subreddit has been shut down. 
I disagree. I don't think we should seriously consider suggestions from food that discriminates based on race.
THE MODS DID NOT BETRAY US, REDDIT BETRAYED THE MODS...
I think that's the whole point. "Make the changes we want, or kiss your user base (and profits) good bye".Of course, it can backfire - for example, admins can simply fire the current mods, and put newer, more compliant ones. So.. meh. I don't really involve myself with this sort of politics.
Don't go on tumblr. 
Sounds kind of ridiculous to me as well. Victoria is an employee of a company, who got fired. Which happens all the time at companies.
well, i feel sympathy for anyone who is suddenly unemployed.  that shit is hard and i don't wish it on anyone for any reason.but reddit's response?  i don't know what world most of reddit lives in, but people losing their jobs happens all the time in minewanna "show solidarity" with her?  pay her rent, car payment, keep her refrigerator stocked with food, generally keep life normal for her kids if she has any, pay her medical bills and help her find workLOLhuman nature being what it is, its much easier to post pics decrying the unfairness of it all
It's big news. I heard it got mentioned on Finnish prime time news, and there's a BBC article on their website right now. 
Christ all might they're coming in hard and fast aren't they? I'll add them to the list.
You... only *just* learnt this?
Right lol. There would be riots.
I'm too young for Reddit to die! I haven't even had my first cakeday yet!
I don't like this at all, but I'm very impressed at the solidarity of reddit's mods at the same time
*hug*I don't want this website to end. Not like this. ;_;
Okay but mods are just regular old reddit users who get a few controls over a subreddit. You can go make one yourself right nowThe admins have zero obligation to involve them with their internal staffing affairs. That would be a nightmare for HRLike or hate the admins, this situation is really dumb. 
It means most of us cant see it.
&#3232;_&#3232;
We will all be set **FREEEEEEEE!**
True. But although all animals are equal, some are more equal than others.
It will be interesting to watch.
Go figure.
That would suck! :c
<3 ilu Tiz.Now to hide from /u/sayyaygirl
we shall rise and take over all of reddit 
I have doubts that without her, some subreddits wouldn't function. There's definitely got to be more politics and behind the scenes drama involved.
Not my dank memes! This is the end!!
The main thing is that the admins know, its more of a mod-admin protest then a user-mod-admin protest. I don't 100% agree with what they are doing, but I completely understand why they are doing it. 
For starters, it goes against one of our primary rules(don't take things too seriously/partaking in a protest isn't casual). And casual conversation isn't big enough to make a significant impact in the protest. While we are not all contented with how the communications are with mods to admins, it wouldn't be fair to take away a place that has no bearing in the dispute. A fair number of the mods have had subs they mod go private as a form of protest, I myself have had two. Naturally, these subs have more of a claim to the protest then we do. 
Its the end times!!!!!!!!!
Lol this thread wouldn't be complete without a good government conspiracy, in my opinion anyway. 
Not the greatest of situations, no.
Yes, and Germany, of all countries, will not be tolerant of things like hate speech and Holocaust denial.
Pls no, anything but 4chan :'(
Can I be a mod pls
do you have a different suggestion?I'm not making claims about moderation, I was just listing similar subreddits to the ones that are set to private. 
Well, theres voat, but that's mostly filled with all the people butthurt over the fph scandal. Not exactly the best of the old reddit community. 
Its not just IAmA. There's askreddit, movies, gaming, art, law, crpapy design, cireclejerk. There's just so much all at the same time. 
I feel like if that was the case there'd be a smoother transition. It's not like relocation happens over night! :0
4chan is literally reddit without a voting system. As a result you see a fair bit of porn/racism/gore on a regular basis but that doesn't mean its all bad. That stuff exist on reddit its just more hidden. I browse /int/ pretty regularly and its always got some great bants and thoughtful conversation as well as some shit flinging. Give it a go, it might not be nearly as bad as you think
I bet you're one of those Damn waffles... 
Well, reddit can't "fire" them in that sense, but they can remove them. The problem is, being a mod is a volunteer position, and modding a default sub is not exactly easy.
Jim Kirk?
We'll never get those details, though.  I think there's generalized legal fear for both ex-employer and ex-employee or something in a situation like this.
Reddit *can't* die! I've never gotten gold AND I'm still a virgin!
I've been on the site for a long time now and I don't think much will come out of it, the Admns can (and probably will) force the current moderators out and install new ones, they are a private company and it's up to us to decided our permanence in it.It sucks, but that's how it goes. 
Once /r/aww goes quiet, its gonna be all over for Reddit.
Hahahahaha, yeah. Hey, while we're on the subject of productivity stopping sites, why don't we call Zuckerberg and ask him if he'll get in on this, hahahahahah.
Yeah this is a new level of angry,  imo, but I'm pretty sure it will blow over.
But thats a really buggy game D:
Where could one go to ask questions and get answers, hmmmm....
Isn't that where the pedos went? No thanks.
It could backfire a bit... They have no idea why Victoria was fired. She could have been diddling orphans or running a conglomerate of puppy mills for all we know. Think of the puppies!
What am I supposed to do while everything's down? Wash the dishes? Walk the dog? This is preposterous!
but it killed them with the AMAs they had lineuped. victoria was their go to person, and then no one even told the mods that she was fired, and then they had no way to contact the people who were coming to do the AMAs. 
Are you the guy from the scorpion killing forum?
But I don't wanna be FREEEE...
Hey, aren't you that Warlizard guy who wrote that Warlizard book.
Assuming the admins can just go out and find a bunch of competent people willing to dedicate huge amounts of their leisure time to a for-profit site at no cost.I don't know the full story, but it seems like Reddit management has been acting pretty fucky lately. I doubt Reddit's going to collapse wholesale, but if this is a nail in the coffin I wouldn't be surprised.
There is a box you can uncheck as a mod so that you are not chosen. Other subs have refused the default treatment.Edit just for any other mods of small subs who might not have noticed this:Settings > other options  "allow this subreddit to be included /r/all as well as the default and trending lists" (uncheck box)
Trust me, there's a lot of fighting among the default mods.
why does everyone keep asking you about a book or saying they recognize you?
Thank god the warlizard forums is doing its own thing. Thanks dude
\*hides under a blanket*
I don't believe it would be right to shut it down. The users did nothing wrong and they shouldn't be punished. 
Love and kindness and casualness for all! MWAHAHAHA!
Yeah, occasionally there are interesting posts. But for actual gaming news, /r/games is much better.
I often look at /r/gaming too, no worries! As long as I still have this sub, I am happy. This stuff will probably be temporary anyway.
voat.co is a clone with some of the improvements that reddit should've had for years. But right now, it's getting the hug of death by all the new comers.
Yeah, true enough. I'm just waiting for the admins to respond. They *cannot* ignore these shenanigans without an explanation, or this website is done for.
Thanks for the quick response!
THE END IS NEAR
9gaglolno
Oh sorry no, I'm not criticizing your list, I'm just.. I dunno, appreciating the irony. Just think of it as the reddit equivalent of an old man rambling.
My concern as well. When the starting bulk of your community are that borderline vitriolic, it's never a good sign. I wonder if a mass migration might be able to change that though.
Don't be irreplaceable. They can't replace you, they can't promote you. 
Hence the whole point of this. It isn't actually about Victoria being fired -- sometimes you need to fire people, whatever. The problem is that they fired her out of the blue and gave notice to the mods of /r/IAmA or any of the other large, important subs that have AMAs. Basically reddit fired the only link between the mods and the admins, leaving mods to handle a bunch of AMAs without as much as the celebrity's contact info. Part of the reason /r/IAmA is shut down is that it can't even function properly.
I have given 4chan a "legit shot". Between white suprem- sorry, race realism, rabid right-wing tendecies (try saying "I think there's nothing wrong with multiculturalism"), sexism and GG, I'd say they are not the place I'd recommend anyone without a lot of patience... or if you're white. Although depending on the board and time of day, the definition of "white" differs.
And what flag flies in YOUR state capital, hmm? IHOP, I bet.
Well, I don't know. I'm sure plenty of people would jump for a chance to mod a big sub, and increase the size of their e-penis manifold. If the admins want to reopen the subs, they don't need replacement mods that are as good as the old, they just need it running good enough so that most people won't notice.
Bold move, let's see if it works...
Happy cakeday and congratulations! I hope I can reach that ~~before reddit goes down~~ someday.
Problem with that theory: krispykrackers is an admin and the top mod of AskReddit. If he really wanted to he could've just turned the sub back on already.I think that shows that they're talking, at least.
Suddenly the masses won't have adorableness to keep them placated. They'll go feral and soon nobody will be safe
Also if we actually get Victoria back it will be the greatest accomplishment the Reddit hivemind has ever made and songs will be sung about it for generations.
maybe try /r/askreddit or even /r/christianity 
I don't think pedos went there, but very toxic angry man children. Still crap.
What they're doing isn't about Victoria. It's about the horrible lack of communication between the mods and admin of Reddit.
God forbid we get some work done! Where are my meaningless internet points?
Then I would say that the admins fucked up by not hiring a replacement before firing their employee, and the fallout is their thing to deal with. That's assuming these AMAs really have been lost, and I kinda doubt that. Maybe they will be now that the mods reacted in this way though. That's kinda bad press, I wouldn't want to be associated with that.Either way I think this is a terrible way to react. Instead of stepping up their game and pooling their resources, they just pouted and decided to mess things up for tons of people who shouldn't have to be affected by any of this. 
They'll hire someone new soon enough, and things will continue on as they always have. It's a big deal for like a week or two
&#3232;_&#3232;
Heh, I try.
FREEDOM FREEEEDOM LAS VEGAS!!
Currently, we *are* the product. But we should be producing the product.
If I recall, digg also collapsed spectacularly after some bad decisions from the top.  I guess one difference though is that voat alternative doesn't have the physical capability to handle an exodus.  Too bad for them, I think they missed a big opportunity.
I believe you.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
Don't hide from me ;-;
Was this your evil plan all along? May I join on this crusade to take over Reddit with love and kindness?
I know, but it doesn't have enough capacity and its a reddit clone which isn't exactly good because it will probably turn out the same as this one. I had something in mind that was a little like a combination of 4chan and reddit.
Ironically, communication is part of the reason they have gone dark. 
I'll take 4chan anytime rather than going to 9gag, thanks very much.With all due honesty, 4chan isn't that all bad though, as long as you don't go to shitty place like /b/.
I ramble all the time :)Although I am not an old man...To me it's funny that the truly well moderated subreddits are just going about their business. I don't know if that's the irony you're seeing but it is the one I'm seeing!
>GGAre there really people here that think GamerGate is bad?
Congrats on the gold!
Halfway there at least...
Thank you in advance! You can totally do it. Just talk to everyone about everything most subs and you'll get there. Or like me get lucky a few times with a comment and watch it skyrocket.
shekk is a lady
I think the issue is mostly that they gave no notice, which implies that her firing was dramatic and unplanned.
Exactly, Reddit won't go down like Digg did, but more like a party that everyone starts to leave one by one.
Idk catching the boston bomber was pretty amazing. /s
Not true at all. Those types are there, but they're here as well. And everywhere online. I have found the community to be engaging, and mostly intelligent and civil. You should check it out before you say stuff like this. 
Hahaha.Seriously though SRS can be blamed for many things but I don't think this is one of them.
That's a very special skill set, so it would be weird to hire someone the same day... As far as why her employment ended, that's probably private regardless of how it happened. She's not a congresswoman. 
yea thats the main gripe, like /r/books had authors going to do an ama, but the mods had no idea how to contact them since victoria was setting it up, and the admins didnt let them know anything about it. seems like they know its not their place to ask why someone was fired, but the admins didnt think ahead and nothing was set up to take on her workload. 
Wait, there is a scorpion killing forum? You should at least be proud of that one. 
Aw, it's why I love you.      ...no...^really
But what about the mods on the Warlizard gaming forums?^^^I'm ^^^sorry, ^^^this ^^^is ^^^the ^^^first ^^^time ^^^I've ^^^had ^^^the ^^^opportunity ^^^to ^^^make ^^^that ^^^joke.I really hate to see all this happening to reddit.
haha that's fair. You haven't found it just gets funnier as you get older though? That's been my experience, but then I do tend to try not to be directly involved with dramatic situations. I didn't figure you were in any drama either though, you seem pretty well liked. :)
then come under the blanket with me silly
i wonder if she's there too
The only place I would go is /mlp/, but they have so much fucked up shit there. I saw a pony having their genitals mutilated the one time I checked there.
I assumed you've never been to either /r/History or /r/AskHistorians; I also made further assumptions (yeah yeah, I know) that you (or anyone not familiar with both subs) think the former is the "main" sub and the latter is the "backup" one. The second fiddle, as it were. In reality, AH is the good stuff; H is just worldnews-lite with a historical slant.
A fellow purple. Have you joined the button arena yet?
"Halfway" is a strong word...
I was just thinking that I should participate in the bigger subreddits more often, like /r/AskReddit... ^(oh wait)
Or how old friends gradually disappear.Really though, I've been considering cutting Reddit's out of my life along with Facebook just for my own mental soundness.  I feel kind of immature browsing these sites these days.  I'm 28 and have been on this site for 4 years; I don't think Reddit is going down soon, but my time is drawing near.
Remember when we elected Obama?
Yeah, I mean why she's gone isn't what's important (unless it's that she was fired for no reason, which would be a reason that *is* the entirety of what's important) it's just fishy that no one's made a blog post or meta thread saying "hey yeah so victoria's gone and we know you guys love her but it's not the end of reddit everything's under control and it's gonna be okay"
If her firing had to do wuth something severe enough that they couldn't risk advance warning, then that's a case where they cannot warn modsHowever, I'm sure mods would be more stunned than pissed if that was the only transgression
Sadly, no.
Fewer times than people have asked me.
I don't even think about it anymore.
My friends list is maxxed out.
Yep. Quite a few.
Just a guy. Wrote some books. Talked some smack. Made some comments. Got stalked and turned into a meme.
&#3232;_&#3232;Same.
I stay out of the drama as much as possible. It eats up what little brain power I have left.
Okay!\*snuggles*
guess again ',:\^)
ah, I see!I do not spend a lot of time in History because it seems really polarized and bias. I love reading AskHistory because it's often incredibly interesting and informative and the discussion usually stays on topic. I just don't contribute much because I'm very much a math person and I'm terrible with these memory type things like history. I just like reading and thinking about it :)
No, I haven't gotten around to it yet haha.
I'd just like to point out that the FPH drama and this all came after the Button ended, meaning that the Button was the only thing keeping this site from imploding. Therefore, I did my part in delaying the collapse of reddit just a little bit longer, while you probably stayed grey and did nothing./s
In one big, messy explosion. They changed the layout of the website, changed the rules giving more power to powerusers and a mass exile went down.It all happen in 48 hours tops.
So the war lizards don't kill scorpions? What is this madness?!
Hey man, it's pretty much free karma for you.
I made it on there though :)
I must read them at once! To the Warlizard gaming forum mobile!
On Reddit, or the web in general? Like Forthewolfx? 
I think this is the kind of response we need to give so the admins do something about it. I've been around here for quite some time and it's obvious that the admins haven't been exactly the most responsive group and anymore the site has only been getting bad press.
Can I join? 
:o is it u???
Purple. 60s. Yes, that .00001 of a second kept us going. If all you purples had saved your presses for single digits, we could have sustained reddit for millennia.
Yes they do.
Just sore as hell.
Until they open up the karma store, it doesn't do much.
Yeah, as people drop off, new people come on. I have no idea why.
Warlizard 
I haven't spoken to the admins in some time.
nooo she's all mine!!!
nooo she's all mine!!!
benis in bagina
I'd check your math again.
And post on a scorpion killing forum about it?
When they do... You could buy anything you want. I'll probably be able to afford Fruit Stripe Gum
Running your Snapchat page takes a lot of resources. Makes sense. 
...oh... ( ;_;)
...oh... ( ;_;)
Yep. You can pretty much live off of peanut butter. Lots of everything you need, especially in a starvation situation.
I thought about it, but decided that would seem too forward.
Creamy! (Although I'm more of a chunky fan)
Was looking for this. First thing I thought of.
You were downvoted but you are true. This whole topic sounds like an ad.
Could be :) I'll run it by my mom. Thanks for your condolences.
My dad was buried with one too haha also a spoon. Thanks for your support :)
I hope you get something truly delicious and wonderful to eat tomorrow that makes you happy. 
Thank you so much!
Came to say exactly all of this. OP, your grandpa had really awesome taste! There really is no better peanut butter. I think opening a new jar of it and taking the first scoop might be one of the best feelings ever (yes I love PP PB that much). Sounds like your grandpa's greatness attracts other great people, what a fun legacy to leave behind :)
Four year old can is probably expired.
Well, on the original post, yes. But, it's been long enough. I don't believe you're here "begging" for more....If, I were you, just add an edit...saying..."A fellow redditor, suggested that I add an address, in case anyone random internet stranger felt the desire to send a jar of Peter Pan peanut butter."
Peanut butter is really shelf stable, can safely be thrown in a backpack, and doesn't have to be refrigerated. It's high in protein, tastes good, and provides a great burst of calories (plus a rush of sugar is often sought after by people trying to get clean from street drugs). Peanut butter is also pretty safe for the older folks who have dental issues and lack the money needed for dentures or surgeries.
Is Peter Pan a regional brand? I feel like I've missed out my whole life now 
Free botulism!
Done! Thanks for your suggestion :)
You bet. Maybe it gets you a couple more jars.
Thanks. I don't do Prime...so, guess I need to order $75, for free shipping.
No experience is more like it. A Tarot card reader is wayy over the top. 
Right? I meant what kind of TAROT reader just says bad stuff like that. 
Maybe the tarot actually said "you will have a baby with a man whom you should not be with", in which case it would have been incredibly accurate though completely not what she expected
When I tell people my family is crazy everyone tells me "ahah, yeah, we all have crazy families". 
Yeah, it really pissed me off too, being a total skeptic.
Always glad to at least make people happier with their family.
Believe me, they've already given us both plenty of complexes.
So are you and OP gonna PM each other? 
I agree. Although dude was posting their pictures on FB talking about how she was the love of his life.
No, no, my sister is blonde, skinny and cute. Her only problem is her shitty family.Not super religious. My mother believes in something undefined while my dad is into all that pagan, esoteric stuff.
Yeah. Well, in Portugal people in general take things a bit more serious. We don't really have the concept of "dating" here. 
I think she'll do fine. We've been dealing with this sort of craziness our whole lives.
Well, I can't say you're wrong. Just less wordy than "this guy she had been seeing for a month".
I wouldn't say I'm exactly fine.
I certainly do. It's sad.
Oh, yeah. I know that sub ;)
Doesn't mean they wouldn't marry and stuff. I mean, I guess they didn't. 
Not really a small town. Suburbs of Lisbon. Small minds, though.
She isn't, actually. She has actually become pretty mature in recent years. 
Well, thank you. I have my issues too.
That's so cute! :)
Me and her are both weird in our ways, though. How could we not?
I often say my parents shouldn't have had children. We're really not the sanest.
Well, I'm a writer. I might use it one day.
I don't even know. They had terrible parents too.
She'll be fine ;)
Too be honest, I thought her boyfriend was an asshole from the beggining. 
I don't know. He believes that kind of stuff. Always worried about spells and demons and shit.
I have been in the same relationship for 10 years. They had no chance to. 
I share your feeling.
Is that right? Because everytime I hear a Tarot story around here (Portugal) there's always related to someone putting a spell on you.
No, no such luck. This is the present.Seriously though, what the fuck?
People in my family take everything too serious.
Just a trashy parents thing, I guess.
Stupidity.
I don't think so. I think they just don't know how to deal with her being sad about it. 
He's serious. He has exorcized his house once or twice.
I understand your bias, but it isn't made up. I'd have nothing to gain from it other than imaginary points.
Apparently.
Well, I think. I wish I could spend more time with her and be more of an influence. 
Oh man, sure. They gave me terrible advice all the time. I had insomnia since I was little and I'd be scared of sounds and shit. They'd tell me it was demons out to get me because we had too many religious books in the house (we were Jehova Witnesses at the time).
Portuguese.
She's bummed out about the guy because she liked him. But it will pass. It's normal! That's the thing. It's normal life. 
With all due respect, that's not really my thing.
Brother ;)
Oh, so that's why I hear that bass groove every morning when I wake up.
No. And they're actually divorced.
I for one have no idea.
Apparently around here it's more of a mix of different things. I believe their only goal is to get money from people, anyway.
As openly absurd, yes.
Nah, she's attractive. And It wasn't the first one.
That's really bad parenting. I'm glad you're doing great :)
Yeah, well. They got married around her age. Divorced 20 years later. My father re-married almost immediately. My mother never had anyone else. It's still lack of common sense. 
The kind that wants you to come back for advice on how to improve. Occasionally it's the kind who will hold your cursed money for you too.
This legit made me LOL
Haha I hadn't thought of that!
Or self fulfilling prophecy 
They probably don't want to say, "Well, that's undoubtedly weirdest reaction I've ever heard of..."
Thanks!  Why'd you quit?  Have you ever thought of going back?  I took one semester in 1994 and then didn't go back until 2002 and they let me keep the credits from before.
My parents got married at 19/20.  My mother seems to believe that you do whatever your husband tells you to and that your job is to be wife.  Which is pretty odd since her mother worked (as a nurse in the Red Cross).  Also, my parents aren't typically conservative or religious or anything.  My father has never told her to obey him or anything.  It's just the way she is.
A couple of semesters I managed to take classes full time in the day and go to work at night.  The rest of the time, I worked during the day and then took classes at night.  The worst part of it isn't that you're so busy, it's that you never really get to experience going to college.  You don't really get to make friends.  You go to class and go to work.  No time to socialize, attend games, or do anything extracurricular.  A gap in your schedule between classes?  Gotta study because you have to work at night/all weekend.  No time for anything but work and school.  
Generic, white American with no cultural/religious/or ethnic upbringing at all.
There is nothing to be skeptical about... it's complete baloney. 
Eh, ignore that shit. I'm sure your super awesome in your own ways and don't need that kinda crap. 
Well, I do like to PM people music...hmm.
Everyone feels like they are the 'love of your life' for the first month. It's chemical. 
that is so weird then and seems like they do suck. I am sorry that they are giving her such a hard time. you are a good brother. Tell her she has nothing to worry about and she should travel and live her own life on her own terms and no one needs to live up to someone else's expectations especially their parents. 
Ah, I missed the country difference. Man, that sounds like a recipe for a lot of unhappy marriages. 
Oh I got another good one for you! My mom once lost $100 and INSISTED a ghost took it. We never did find that $100. SPOOOKY!!
Well, she needs to know that yes, her parents might presumably want the best for her, but at 22, they don't really have any control over her. They can offer advice, sure, but they can't control her actions.Nothing wrong with her listening to their suggestions, but she needs to make her own decisions now.
Sensible at least? I feel you though @_@
My mom got sucked into conservationism as well.  She went from life long old south democrat (Bill Clinton supporter) to facebook spamming republican.  Ewe.
That's good to know, it would be really concerning if she fell for that stuff.
Yeah, that's most likely the case, and I am sorry to hear that. What I was trying to say is that, regardless, the actual issue here is your parents' approach to the matter.
If your sister is still living at home she should leave home. 
Oh, that's interesting.  It must be different in different places.
Ugh I know that feel. I didn't have any serious relationships til I was 20 and that was only a year ago. Sometimes you have to learn through trial and error. Sadly my dad knows of one of my interests because my car broke down when I went to see her. That was no fun.
That's insane, my condolences. Glad she's got a reasonable person around to help her cope in a healthy way.
Woah, Jehovah's Witness to Paganism?  Oddly enough, my brother-in-law did the same transition.  
that's a totally normal reaction. does she see how crazy your parents are being?
No worries :)
The front page is like -43 comments. 69 upvotes.  22 comments. 20 upvotes.  450 comments. 2300 upvotes.
Oof, what kind of other things have they done?
All they needed to do was pre-arrange the reader to give her good advice and slip her an extra $20.
The kind that should have the book thrown at them.
How random. What stuff?
I'd venture to say that some writers on some shows could turn that into a whole season.
Oh, no, I haven't told them this particular story.The ones who have met my family in person instantly understand what I mean.
That's a good one! I'm going to pirate it.
Wow. Well, that's at least entertaining right? Unless she really is unstable.
I was going trough a rough path in my life. I had great grades but stopped going to classes. Then my scholarship ended and I had no money to stay enrolled.
Your grandmother sounds awesome :-)  Yeah, some women seem to really enjoy being subservient!  And that's great, if you marry the right guy, I guess.I've found that 8 years in I kind of like playing the dutiful wife part, having dinner ready when he gets home, etc.  But that's only because it's my idea and he still seems really surprised and grateful EVERY SINGLE DAY.  If he ever ordered me to have dinner ready I'd tell him to go fuck himself :)(Also, for what it's worth, I got married at 27).
Are you currently working?  Serious question.
Well, I know that. You know what I mean. 
I try to. Thanks :)
Yeah, but most are smart enough to not say it.
Yes, thanks. I try my best :) Seems like you would be a good sibling/parent as well.
It's not really the same thing, is it? American "dating" is much more casual.
I do get it off my chest. My parents are costing me a fortune in therapy.
My mother was always a conservative.  She was a 20+yr National Guard veteran and she also spent 20+yrs as a law enforcement officer.  She has always been somewhat bigoted and judging, but I remember her able to construct legitimate arguments and to somewhat reasonably explain why she felt the way she did.Now, it seems that her ability to reason and use logic have completely disappeared.  She has become a hate filled "Christian" who judges everyone who is different from her.  
She really should. In Portugal it's hard for people her age to do so, though. 
Thank you for your insights into this subject :)
I'm not half as present as I'd like to be.
I don't think they consider themselves anything. People around here just believe random supernatural stuff.
I think she does. 
Not going to fly.   These fortune tellers can make big bank off of people with that curse removal shit.  They've been know to take people for thousands of dollars or more.   It's crazy.  
She did. I always try to make it all make sense and then hope it sinks in. Basically, I'm not as present as I'd like to be, but so far, she's still the least crazy person in my family. I also scolded my mother about her views on the subject. To my father, eh, his beliefs are a more touchy subject.
I'll call the tarot police.
Tarot cards of course.
No offense, but I would **not** like to meet your parents. On the other hand, if you ever need to talk about how crazy they are, I will lend a sympathetic ear.
I used it in my stand-up act twenty years ago. One of the dozens of people who saw me might remember it. ;)
Oh. I forgot the homeless uncle with a gambling problem who expected my dad to pay for everything for him. On the plus side my mom's side is incredible! I (naturally) saw them more anyway. I did see my dad's side a little bit growing up, but it got harder as we grew as they were all being arrested or put into hospitals. The worst part is I feel bad for my father, and definitely appreciate everything he was for us and how he managed to stay positive for so long. 
Look into how much Pell Grant you have left. Might be able to finish some courses at a community college, then finish elsewhere.
I like doing a lot of the traditional wife roles too.  I'm currently a stay at home mom, so I have his dinner ready each night.  But every night he says, "Thank you for making dinner."  (Although I also don't let him cook, because he's pretty terrible at it :) )
Oooh okay just checking
Dang, what wOuld you do? Just tell them some nonsense?  Oh oh, did anybody ever* "call you out" for a bullshit reading? 
I hear ya. I know they just want to help, but the lack of rational thinking and empathy just surprises me sometimes.
Sounds like she dodged a bullet. :)
well your best is great=)Thank you! I really appreciate it man =D 
Bill them. ;)
Ewe, sorry dude.
Ah, Portugal, Spain's forgotten sister country. Where no one, not even in Spain, knows what the fuck is inside Portugal except they know they are as supersticious and zealoty as the Spanish culture.Good times.
that's a good thing. i hope things get less crazy for you :)
Is that the rapper turned singer?
isn't the definition of common sense that it's, well, common? If it's uncommon then it doesn't really count anymore as "common".
Regular police will be fine.  They can be charged with fraud.
O_O the mantis shrimp is a thing of glory. I can't draw a thing now cause my mum just made me turn off the lights (its 1am), but maybe I'll surprise you when i wake up morning.
I do/am both. Dobedobedo!
I saw that.
Thank you :)
You don't reuse jokes?
Well, make sure to keep reminding him of that and of how much he means to you :)
Or student loans. One year of loans won't put you in too much debt if your degree is good. Or you are happy where you are and don't want to go back, which is also fine.
It's great to hear (read) that :) Thank you!
Ooh, now I had not thought about using it for writing... there is an interesting idea.
> gods or something were speaking to her through the cardsSuspending disbelief for just a second, it isn't out of the realm of possibility for a god to control a card's shuffling. She is crazy, but the logic is sound.
I thought it was pretty bovious. 
I just listened, asked questions, laid out the cards, and gave them the best advice I could. I used the cards like story prompts.People used to come for a reading all the time to try to *prove* that the cards were bullshit, then talk themselves into believing. 
Watch out for his latest Mixtape: Come on, SENSE!
i think we should call it occasional sense tbh
I don't think a fortune teller can be charged with fraud.
Awesome! Good luck!
Then draw the man his stuff!
Somehow I missed that! Lol. I'm stupid.
D: Don't call the cops!
I wanna hear crazy parent stories too! 
I try to only reuse my own. I'm not very good at it, though. Probably just as well I didn't stay in stand-up.
Depends on the receiving school - some have 10-year limits, others don't.
While it may technically be within the realm of possibility (if only in the sense that everything is technically in the realm of possibility), I can assure you that her logic was in no way sound. It's a pretty big logical leap from "there is a non-zero chance that this may be a possibility" to "this is definitely the case and the gods told me red is bad for you so I burned all your red clothes and also the fact that I just pulled the Empress card means if I eat any fruit today I will die".I wasn't being flippant when I said legitimately crazy.
Oooh okay, i was just checking. 
Sooooo, you wanna play MTG with your Tarot deck? 
That's an ignorant statement. He has a very beautiful singing voice. You should look up his npr concert.
Deductive, logical reasoning doesn't cut it for a description? 
I like taste personally 
It's slippery slope.  Several have been charged in the past, the most famous probably being Rose Marks.
:-D its a quack!
I forget that it's not automatically expanded like it is on reddit is fun.
$20 bucks.
Few know this, but their cyborg tech is hidden under the soft flaps of their furry bellies. proceed with caution. these cyborg creatures counterattack most viciously when security is breached. good night and good luck.
I was going for a road sweeper shaking its broom at the ploopy eagle. But i know not what north korean roadsweepers looked like, and the stick figure was too small. @_@ Son i am not, daughter i am. 
Like that time my mom sold my desktop computer for 50$ so she could buy smokes? I was in college far from home at the time. 
Yeah... Stay in stand-up too long and your legs get tired.
Well, I am not sure if you checked, so, I am making it clear that it was very bovious to the rest of us. 
Nah. Too many creatures, not enough denial.
Yep....he's also a producer and has sold several million records. If that is a 'nobody' then sign me the fuck up. I will count my money on a beach in my underwear while reddit makes fun of me. 
Deductive...what? What is this deductive you speak of?
XD that's quite clever, wish I could upvote you more!You should make a full tarot set like that! I'd pay 15$ for that for sure!
I have no money... :(
Road sweeper that's a witch?And sorry about that. Saying "you've got skills daughter" doesn't have quite the same ring to it though. Actually sounds a bit creepy.
Holy shit. Was your pc custom built?
But then they wouldn't 'work' according to lore. They have to be a gift.
But I already did one for the dragon dude and im sleepy. @_@
Hello? Police? We got one here!
Not to mention the girl knew his ex so she was probably her friend he tried asking out. Hmmmm
Yeah, makes sense. I don't reckon it was the smartest thing I did - it certainly was a rebound, but I figured I'm never going to see her again and just asked. It is me time now - getting back to working out, playing Zelda on my Switch, and work!
Thank you :)
I do think I'm acting like I've moved on more than I have - but ever since I found out my ex has moved on too I figured it's pointless for me to keep thinking about what was. 
Thanks man! And I'm sure you'll do fine - no first time is easy, but you've got this.I'm actually pretty terrible at driving - I live in a country with great public transport and never really had to learn when I was younger, but as a 22 year old who is a bad driver, I regret not working on it sooner. 
I'm likely never to meet her again - she lives in Paris and I live a couple of hours away. I had asked her if I could ask her on a date when I'm in Paris next week for work.But we did spend the rest of the evening hanging out and it wasn't terribly awkward - so not the best, but not the worst.
Definitely. I'm much happier since I asked!
It sometimes feels like an ego thing - like should I move on because she has too? I don't even know if I want to date now, but I want to entertain the idea that I still can date.
True, I think I'll just play it easy - but it does feel nice knowing if I want to, I can get out there again. :)
Thanks - that's awesome to know! I figured I won't get to see the girl again and if I was going to try some time, I might as well now. It was only afterwards I felt like I'm getting over my old relationship. 
What's the worsen that can happen if she says no?
Pretty much the same happened to me, minus the catching up with the friend. Cheers to you mate!
I don't recommend this at all. 
Not a friend, but an acquaintance - but you're right, in hindsight, it probably wasn't the best person to ask.
It's been almost 2 years for me but at this point I think I'm just too lazy
3 weeks is nothing. I'd even say it's too soon. 
You're gonna be just fine dude. I was with my high school sweetheart for 10 years! Felt like the world was ending when that was over. Now it's been 5 years and I'm married to someone fantastic who is also much better for me.The doing you part is important because you want to attract people who are into you for who you are-- and getting in touch with your interests and having a hobby is a great way to cultivate that.
There's always a first time for everything, as everyone else has said! Well at least you've got your license now, better late than never. Living in a country with a great public transport service sounds nice and cost-friendly since you can save up on spending on gas.
Aw, thanks for the uplifting motivation! I'll try to put this in my mind while taking it so I can cool myself out. Though I can't really do much for the asshole drivers that's quite everywhere in my country...
Our countries might be different in terms of the process of taking a license, but for me this is my third lesson.The first one was sort of like a conference you have to sit through and listen on the basics and road safety. Once done with that, the second step is to take a test where you have to answer some questions. I failed this one a lot and had only passed it recently which was *so satisfying*. And now here I am on my third, holding the wheel for the first time!
I did have this one hung up on my mind, just hoping that I get a good and friendly instructor. Thanks by the way!
There ya go, keep up the positivity c:
Okay, thanks for the answer! I guess it's better that way, as in your circle of friends there isn't an awkward node, and I'm really proud of you for actually biting the bullet and doing it, as there's never really much of a sweet spot. It's just "Oh, I don't really know her, she won't say yes", and "I don't want to ruin a friendship".But like I said, super great job for actually pushing though and doing it, regardless of the result.
If you're not sure then just take a little more time to figure it out, but don't gauge whether or not you should have moved on just cause she has. 3 weeks isn't all that long compared to how long yall dated and on top of that you're young, you've got plenty of time to figure things out
Yea I felt like shit after my break up a month ago. Thought I'd never stop being depressed. But then I went out and met up with people to hike and just enjoyed people sans relationship portion and i realized, the world is a big and fun place with many different people. it's almost ridiculous to mope around about one person out of the billions. 
Just that, the worse that'll happen us she says no. And I tell myself that every day, but to no avail. 
If you don't try - nothing happens.
Hey maybe she will tell her and make your ex feel some shit!
Almost 2 years for me as well man. Still finding it tough. But main thing for me now is to focus on myself and career.. Sadly have 0% care for myself. No idea where to start. Gyms are a little too... Scary? But yeah, relationships suck yo.
Honestly the first 3 weeks for me didn't matter, that shit started to haunt me about a year later. I've moved on and have an amazing girlfriend, but sometimes she still shows up in my dreams and it's been over 3 years.
That's actually how the last one happened. I was doing my thing and she just jumped into my life brightening everything. I can confidently say I was on the receiving end of the pick up game.
I would say give it a year. The biggest mistake I ever made in my life was getting into relationships too soon. I really screwed up with some nice people and I deserved to have time alone to grow as a person. It's hard being alone after having someone but you will be a better person if you wait.
Yeah, the idea of her with someone else hasn't been great. I know she has been single and can do what she wants, but man, it isn't fun...
Congratulations on passing and good luck on the roads. I'm from the UK where you need to pass a theory test which covers signs and road markings before you can take a practical test which is just driving a set route with an examiner. Passed the theory but now practicing for my practical test. :)
I'm not sure if you're just going along with it or if I have confused you.The thing about the Netherlands is a joke. Of course you won't get a license without passing the test - all license plates in the Netherlands are yellow.I edited my previous post a bit to hopefully make it more obvious that I'm joking...
Set a date and do it. Ask her Friday. That way you have time to plan out what you'll say, where you'll invite her to, etc. and worse case scenario she says no, but you won't wonder if you should have. How will you feel if someone else asks her out? You'll wished you asked then. 
There's a wide margin between nothing and twice a day. 
Maybe?...Rule #1 of life: Girls always talk. 
Maybe he wasn't looking for a relationship with this new girl
I, too, do not like gyms. Do you have those outdoor exercise areas in your community? Its typically some benches/balance beams, pull-up bars and such. I like to use those because they're usually not full of staring people and bonus, they're outside in the nice fresh air. Just my two cents!
Well, 8 is a bit young yet
A year? Gtfo it and move on. No one has time for that
I did it because deep down you knew it yourself. Thank me later.
I was in the exact same shoes a year and a half ago man. After 6 years my ex moved on very quickly to the next few guys. Knowing that tore me up, but man I know everyone says this to you and I know you're tired of hearing it, but it gets better. I go full days without even thinking about her even a little. You're gonna do great buddy. 
I didn't check the link...so yeah I thought you were serious. Either way, that was dumb of me :v
Agreed. Just take the shot. Even if it leads to rejection you will know that you tried, instead of regretting this many years from now. 
2 isn't very wide!
Rule #2: Guys talk more than you think they do.
I hate gyms as well but, I do kickboxing where yes, you are there with other people but, you just stand in front of a bag while the instructor tells you what to do. Found that a lot easier than going to the gym. 
...are you 12?
Yeah jeez how long do people think life is? We're lucky if we get 30,000 days on this earth.If you're ready to date other people, do it. If not, don't. It doesn't matter if it's been 10 months or 10 minutes.
So much this, especially the getting better part. Ex broke it off after a year together because she was tired of overgiving without even sitting down and talking about the problems, and found some new people and probably is gonna end up with the guy whose extra attention started the end for us. Hurts to even think of them together, and I have to see them together since we work at the same office. And all people say is that it gets better with time...
Don't worry. I should have made it clearer. It's my fault :D
I wished I seen this sooner. Did you ask? How'd it go? If not, wait until the shift is over so if it doesn't go well you don't still have an awkward interaction the rest of the night. 
What? No we don't.
Thank you, brother/sister. I have been cursed by Broki and old age. Broki has cursed upon me injury that leaves me away from the Iron Temple for almost 3 fortnight.Soon, with the All Spotters blessing, I will be back praying in the most Holy of 5x5 devotions. As it was written, so shall it happen for the All Spotter does not rack weights we cannot lift.Wheymen.
Excuse me mister, you dropped a t. /r/bodyweightfitness/
It's better than doing nothing and if it starts you on a regular program that spans more than one day a week all the better.
It's important to give yourself time to recover from a breakup, learn from it, and let that new knowledge set in. That process creates maturity and helps to start and maintain better future relationships. Of course recovery periods depend on the situation/ person and can take 10 minutes, but it's much likelier to take longer.
Being single is great is so many ways, and you can still have sex of course but wait until your ready for the commitment and time it takes to have a healthy full time relationship.Everybody has a different situation but taking some time to treat yourself good after a split is way better than jumping right back into a relationship because a real one is a lot of work and exhausting. Take a break!
Nah yer good haha. And I didn't ask her out, but she didn't have any tables so she sat with me and we chatted for a good half hour. So I found out more about her, and now I'm a bit more confident in asking next time. :)
Talking? Pffft Don't be so silly.
Wheymen, I wish you a journey back to full health and happiness brother/sister.Sometimes Broseiden pushes us backwards so we may remake our gains. Truly you are blessed.
THIS.  "Motivation gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going." You're not going to feel motivated everyday. But once you get in a routine you start holding yourself accountable. Sometimes the hardest part is getting to the gym, or starting that first exercise. But once you actually get the workout started, it's a piece of cake.  After the workout you'll feel really proud of yourself too, for sticking it out.
Next time that happens get her to laughing and show her you're fun to be around. When she's relaxed, ask her, but frame it as "I'm going whether you go or not" but don't use those words. haha That way it doesn't feel like your evening plans are contingent on her. "I'm going to X Saturday night. Would you like to come with me?" She'll get the implication and it won't be awkward. You got this. 
Talkings overrated. Men communicate in a series of head nods and grunts and we can perfectly understand each other
When a joke get a political response.Not saying you're wrong (I think you're right)Just, chill man, not everything have to be about something
I didn't even think of that. Thanks for all the advice :)
You can't forget eyebrow raises. Arguably the most communicative gesture we do.
Just cuz I'm explainin' stuff doesn't mean I'm mad bro. Just givin' peeps the low down.
You got this. I have faith. I'll await an update. :-)
Woah! Flux Pavilion? THE Flux Pavilion? That's fucking awesome! Thank you man, I appreciate it :)I think it's so cool that some artists, regardless of their fame, still connect with fans and just act like regular people and do regular people stuff, because most artists that are hit by fame just become all snobby and shit. But you. I like you.Keep rocking on man <3
Haha I love them too! I'm most likely gonna get to meet them, and I'm so excited for it! I'm not that great, and it's my first time playing in front of such a big crowd, so I hope I don't mess up ! :p
No, not one bit! My family was generally very supportive of my dreams, it's just that financial problems held me back more than anything. Before my grandfather passed, he always told me that as long as I'm doing good in classes and behaving in school, he'd buy me whatever I wanted. I've never taken advantage of it, but it was always nice to know that even though we were a middle class family, he'd look out for me regardless.
Haha thanks for the tips man, I kinda figured half that stuff out though :p The crowd is an under 18 crowd, and they only enjoy very coherent music, so my set's pretty precise when it comes down to it ; progressive house, big room, and a bit of future bass / house.
Hahaha that first line was hilariousAnd thank you, I'm only 16 and these types of events happen every so often and I was luckily chosen to open up for them, so although it's not such a big opportunity, it's a huge step in the right path :)
Yea, you tell 'em.
It'a never too late to chase your dreams, just call it a hobby and roll with it! And thank you haha , im so excited for tonight !
Thank you so much man, that's honestly one of the nicest things someone has ever told me. If I could give you gold, I so would haha. I promise I'll gild you when I get the money to, pinky promise <3
Yea, they're great ! What work did they do for LoL?
I'm playing Pacha U18 located in NYC :)
Fucking awesome. Fuck that tattooer for being a dickhead. Send him a picture of your rose and caption it "Go eat dicks".I wanna see it too though! <3
Aw! You showed him :) Fuckin' grandpa, always being such a sarcastic samuel. 
Haha thank you! DJing is definitely an expensive hobby and you have to be really sure that you want to do exactly that in the future, or else that's a lot of money down the drain.  Used equipment / second hand / etc is great, but you have to be careful where you buy it from. Lol but thank you again :)
Yea, getting the ball rolling in the crowd is definitely not the easiest task. Lots of things can go wrong, and the people that say that are generally the people that I don't like to associate with, hahaha.But more importantly, springs for legs. I can sit on a wheelchair and still DJ and shake headliners' hands, but if I have hand-chainsaws, then I can't shake any hands and I ruin every piece of equipment I touch!
Haha man, thank you so much for that. It's a very small accomplishment tonight, but it's a foot in the door for my DJ career.
4* and like I said, I'm opening for them at an Under 18 event, so the promoters couldn't hire any adult openers, because that would kind of defeat the purpose.
Let's hope so. Thanks! Haha
Haha yes! Them mocking me just made me want to be a huge DJ so I can show them what I'm made of! :p
Thank you man! Never give up on that dream, no matter how hard it seems, just keep trying and pushing and getting yourself out there. I'll try to keep my ear out for it, but get ready for new music! I'll ask them a few more questions about it and I'll update the whole post tomorrow, I promise! 
Won't be using a laptop, I'll be using CDJ2000s, but you can touch my USB sticks if you want ;)
Thank you man! The first thing I can tell you is to just get your name out there! Make a few different 30 minute mixes, different genres, songs, etc. Then email a bunch of clubs, promoters, facebook pages for events, and ask if theyre looking for opening DJs. Don't send them that mix unless they ask, and personalize your email so it doesn't sound robotic and stuff. Most importantly though, have fun with it!
Freaks Have More Fun. Such a nice song.
Haha seriously ! I'm trying to reply to all of the comments but this hit the front page on my reddit at least, and I can't believe it haha
You went to their Dada Land Brooklyn Compound show? That's fucking awesome! How was it?
Fuckin' grandma...
Thank you!
Thank you! I'll try my best :p
Hahahaha! That comment had me rolling in laughter for a good few minutes. I love that man, that's hilarious :p Guess it's DeanTheDJ - 1 / Dada Life - 0 for now, huh? Haha
Well, that's your opinion and I can't bash you for disagreeing with mine, but to me this is a huge step in the right direction for what I want to do in the future.
Hahaha it definitely is!
Haha that would be great, but I can't play any Dada Life tracks in my set, their manager would put a damn hit on me lol
That's awesome! Fucking DJ-bro! <3
No worries! I'm 16, turning 17 in May :)
Thank you :) I'm sure she didn't mean it in a rude way, though, but it still stuck with me for a while.
Check fucking mate! :p
That's awesome! I think you should just do you regardless of what your parents say. Mind sharing some of your work? :)
Check my post edit, I just edited answering a few questions :)
No way! Haha which one man? :pEdit : Wow, I'm dumb. Haha I loved that preview man! I used to listen to it on repeat for a few days after it came out, trying to picture how the whole song would go. Seriously dude, that's some good stuff ! 
Thanks for listening regardless, and thank you! It's tonight, but it's the thought that counts hahaha <3
Both producer and a DJ :)
Haha thank you!
Haha yea, me and the promoter that booked me are really chilled out now so I look forward to the future :)
Thank you! <3
Thank you! EDM production is such a hard task to get started with, but once you know what you're doing (which takes forever to learn), it's pretty much smooth sailing, while you gradually learn more and more things to advance your music. Head on over to /r/EdmProduction and you can ask some questions about the stuff :)If you'd like to begin producing, a well known software that will probably never go obsolete is FL Studio. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me :p
Thanks man! Everything went so well, I'll be posting an update tomorrow!
Yea! Screw grandma (only when she's mean)!
Thank you so much! I appreciate it, and I loved doing the set :)
Haha good luck being a writer man, I hope to see DJArctic's novel coming out soon :pAt the venue I used the club's CDJ2000s with their DJM 400 mixer, I believe. There was an amazing sound system, and that's all that matters haha, it sounded great in the booth and in the crowd.
Don't let it get to your head. At the end of the day, you're the most important thing in your life. Never take someone's opinion to heart that you didn't ask for. If you need anything or wanna talk in general, feel free to pm me :)
Thank you :) I'm pretty nervous as well as excited, so I need all the luck I can get hahaha.
You're doing god's work, son.Compensating your work now.
Thank you so much :) 
Fuck yea, DJ-bro.
Haha thank you!
Haha yea, definitely did :)
Thank you man! I appreciate it :)
Oh fuck yea. Home sweet home.
Haha it will and I'm so excited! I remember listening to Dada Life and thinking to myself, "holy crap I wish I could be like them one day" when I was like 14, and I guess this more or less gets pretty close :p
Haha I wish man, a man can dream! Thank you :)
You mean you finished listening to one of their songs? Which one? And thanks ! :)
Hahaha, don't we all have that dream?
Thank you! I appreciate the support :)
Thank you man! Appreciate it :)
It's never too late to try again! Get yourself out there, grab life by the balls, and say "HEY, FUCKFACE, IM YOUR UMF 2016 HEADLINER."
Never be scared to do it! Go to your local music shop and look around. Turntables don't cost that much. I use controllers, but a decent pair of turntables plus a mixer will set you back maybe $300 / $400. Look into it, keep looking, keep looking, and keep looking ! Look for used equipment, old donation equipment, etc. Don't get discouraged from trying out something you know you'd love because of money issues, man!
Music.Lots of it.Haha, all jokes aside, if you're new to that term, it basically means I spin a bunch of music in random genres, with the set starting off very mellow and chilled out, and by the end of the set, the music is very energetic and blood-pumping, as to get the crowd excited for the headliner. I'll be playing progressive house, big room, future bass, deep house, future house :)
Wrong. I'm a producer too.
Haha tonight I'm going to Dada Land :p
Someone downvoted, but I upvoted you back to neutral state. Your opinion is your opinion man. If I do what I love, what's it to you?
Well, I had actual friends celebrate with me when we were all at the party, but I decided telling the internet would be cool too. But hey, fuck me right?
>I'm not that greatGet that shit out of your head. 
That's awesome! I always wished I could've pursued a career in documentary film making but felt my parents invested waaaaaay too much in private education to jeopardize it in such a niche field. Maybe I'll get to pursue it one day!
Dada Life to U18's? Lucky kids
BPM is a big one. If the opener plays a ton of high energy music that the crowd loves and the BPM is faster than what the headliner plays, then it can very easily make it feel like the opener had a more exciting set and that's not something anyone wants to happen in their show.
> I'm only 16 That's the info I was scanning for ;) Absolutely fantastic mate, well done... and as some one up-thread said:   "make 'em proud they picked you".I look forward to your update and some pic.
I didn't give up the dream entirety, I just found something I was more interested in. I'll always be ready to run sound or play or a few sets, it is just no longer my main goal :) 
Nah I don't need gold. I really wouldn't know how to use it. What you should do is put it into your music and give it everything you have. Knowing that you are able to accomplish exactly what you wanted from this is worth more than any amount of gold. Just pinky promise me that you will try to inspire people to go after their dreams and do what you have done. Also don't forget about us when you get famous <3
The latest ultimate skin, DJ Sona, has 3 soundtracks, and each track is a collaboration of 2 electronic artists/groups. They worked on one of them
Pacha, nice one! Congratulations :) U18 sounds fun too haha :D Anyway, enjoy your evening!
Thank you very much, very excited for you. 
Thanks man!But why shouldn't I send them that mix unless they ask? I'd think they'd like some kind of reference on how good you are.
Well your seem to be doing a good job,  wasn't expecting a reply!  :)
Their set was epic, but the whole venue was a bit to cramped for my liking 
Thanks. I'm glad that I've improved your mood. Have a great performance.
Any tracks your looking forward to playing out?
Wow im also 16, turning 17 this year. I've always thoughr of getting into djing but now i feel rekt :p
Thank you for the response! :D You can check my submitted stuff on my page. Sadly I still didn't get the pics from the shoot yet. :(
I'm on it as soon as I get home!
deciding whether i should release it as part of an ep full of prog house songs i haven't released, but I'm glad you liked it! I'll send you a link when it's out! (:
Ah, good. Carry on.
Was it hard making a name for yourself? If you dont mind me asking
Keep it up! The beginning is always a humbling experience.
I hear ya bro...and I would if it was still what I wanted I  life.   I had my fun and it was a GREAT ride... Congrats on your gig.
This really made me smile, so thanks. :)You're a good OP. I bet you'll smash the gig tomorrow!
Are you spinning records, or pushing buttons to play samples and such? I'm not as familiar as I should be with this stuff.
I think he meant it sarcastically, pretty sure he's not raining on my parade, I hope! Benefit of the doubt is always good <3
Haha yeah sure you did. That's always the first thing I do after celebrating with friends, I go and tell a bunch of anonymous strangers lol
Yea, insecurities are a bitch. I've got to have all the confidence and all the balls in the world to get on that stage, and it's gonna be hard but i'm gonna fucking do it and rock that stage, and if I trainwreck then so be it, ahaha
Haha thank you! The openers are chosen by lottery, since there's a good 12 opener djs going for the slot, so I guess it's more luck than talent lol, but regardless thanks!
Haha I definitely will! If you'd like I can send you some cool pictures and have them say hi on camera for you, if they're cool with it :p
Haha I heard the funniest thing today! I was in the main lobby of the venue, waiting for my boss to come downstairs to pick me up and take me backstage, and all of a sudden some official looking dude wearing a whole suit comes out of some heavy door and makes a beeline for the front door, and when a security guard asked him where he was going, he says "Dada Life wants some bananas". The dude came back a few minutes later with a whole bag filled with bananas lmao, greatest laugh I had in ages.
I think you'd be hard pressed to find a successful documentary film maker who's education was cheap.Don't worry about your parents, worry about yourself. In the end they don't care about the money as long as you're happy.
Yea man, these kids definitely don't know what kind of a treat they're in for tomorrow with Dada Life.
Haha I hope I'll be making them proud when I rock the house tonight. Updates and pics are definitely coming tonight :)
Hahaha thanks man, I appreciate it :)
Thanks, I'm glad you liked it :) 
Shit man, I love Flume haha. Regardless of my fame (which I doubt I'll even receive any), reddit is forever my besf friend <3
Thank you! <3
Ah I see :pWhat do you now? Is it related to music, or something completely unrelated?
Interesting! I'll check it out tomorrow when I wake up if I have enough time before I have to go for soundcheck haha
Haha it's a great place, the sound system is apparently amazing :p Thank you, and you too :)
Thank you man :) The gig went wonderfully, I had loads of fun :p
Thank you! Just got back from the venue, will post an update tomorrow, but unfortunately besides from a quick handshake, I didn't get to speak to Dada Life. Their security was very tight, as they're world class DJs. Still alright though, because they put on a hell of a show!
Bet you weren't expecting a reply to this one either ;)
Yea, the venue seemed a bit small when they posted the pic on their facebook page. How was the sound system?
Thank you man! I appreciate it :)
Haha don't be! It's never too late to try :)
No problem! I tried to respond to everyone that commented on the thread / replied to a comment of mine, since they're taking the time out to comment on my thread supporting me / giving me tips / etc. Your stuff is awesome! Keep up the awesome work :)
Haha alright, no problem! :P
Yea, that sounds like a good idea. Do it, and do it very soon. <3Aha I can't wait man :)
Hahaha why do you ask? :)
Haha no, it's really not once you learn it! I thought FL was difficult until I just started to click buttons and see what everything does. It's all very simple actually :)And I love Pro Tools! I record vocals of a friend's rap group with it, and it works wonders! 
I don't mind at all! Thing is, I don't have a name yet. Nobody knows who the hell I am. On the club's facebook page, they had this ad a few months back asking for djs and stuff to email them. I sent them my email and thought nothing of it, until superbowl sunday where I get a text saying something along the lines of "Hey, checking up on your offer to dj. We have Dada Life. Are you interested?". And I just took it from there :)
Haha, I've been told many a times that line and for now I'm just taking life a day at a time. No need to rush things out !
Ah i hear you dude. At least you enjoyed the hell out of it, by the looks of it. And thank you!Mind sharing one of your favorite stories / experiences?
So you mean OP wasn't a bundle of sticks today? Hahaha, thank you so much, I hope I don't screw up! I'll edit sunday morning with the story :p
Probably using a pair of CDJs which is kind of an electronic turntable that you can load digital music onto. Sort of a mixture of those two concepts. It's not extremely common these days for people to spin vinyl records (it is certainly still around though). 
Different genres are basically different feelings given to the crowd. Listen to Calvin Harris - Summer. That's progressive house and that makes the crowd all happy and stuff. Now listen to Sandro Silva - Epic. That makes the crowd go absolutely nuts and jump up and down and stuff. Lastly, listen to an old Skrillex song. That makes the crowd rage and hate the DJ. Haha, just playing though. Different genres = different reactions.
How did you get selected for this? I don't think they pick some random dude off the street to open for a popular act. 
I doubt she started it, granted she was super old. She probably was there when the first coke came off the line...And if you mess up cutting just quickly fade and carry on. They *may* notice but are to fucked up on drugs to care enough to FUCK RAGE! WHOO!!! just wish I could come see you that'd be so bad ass hahCongratulations on the gig bossman. I'll send good vibes your way :)
I saw them at GDF 2011. They were soooo hammered during their set haha. I ended up leaving to see gareth emery. I imagine they wont be chugging bottles of champagne and half gals of grey goose for u18s
I'm telling you right now, self pity is just waste of energy. Stop being condescending to yourself. It's a pit that only eats joy and returns nothing.Keep doing what you're doing, but stop saying negative stuff about yourself. Strive for greatness and be the best you can be. You're only human.
Pretty unrelated. I've taken a huge interest in 3d modeling and animation and would like to pursue a career in that area! 
The song is called Kinetic
Not an issue my friend :) I'll get right on it!
Waiting on you man! I'd love to hear what they brought. Where abouts was this preformance? 
I tried yesterday, started with bpms and s. On but atm im only good at crossfading between songs. But we'll see :)
Very kind of you! Responding seems very rare now.Thank you very much and have fun DJing! :DD
I like it :) It seems mostly EDM and dubstep and thats not all my style, but I certainly dont find it bad. Keep at it, your doing great. Also, Im jealous as fuck :D
Because- and I say this as a producer myself- it's hardly impressive to be talking about how you're opening for Dada Life if all you're doing is playing other people's music. It's another thing entirely if you've written and produced your own tracks and are finally having the chance to play them in front of a crowd.
Ha, a gig is a gig! Rock out with your dong out 
Haha, there were plenty of bundle-of-sticksy OPs today but you weren't one of them :PI look forward to it!
Kinda just sent them an application with basic info, and they texted me a few weeks later. Yea, they pretty much did exactly that, haha
Good point. His songs are shit and you see that he put no effort into them unfortunately. Guess that's one celebrity spot wasted haha
As in trainwrecking? Thing is, it's fine if a popular person does it, as their fanbase and the crowd is more forgiving becausw it's a celebrity. If an opening DJ messes up, the crowd will remember him for the one screw up he made, not the other 58 minutes of energetic music.
Haha thank you! I rocked that stage so well, I believe! Being confident of your own music is the first step to getting yourself out there and making a name for yourself. Make music that you love, most importantly, not that others love. Enjoy yourself most of all.
Hahaha, great point. Thanks so much, I'll definitely keep the good ol' filter & fade technique when I'm in a sticky situation tonight :p
That's so cool! I'd love to hear more about it :) Now that I think about it, I guess when I said I'm interested in film, I realized that I hadn't meant big tv productions with famous actors. I guess documentary film and home film and short film projects is more what I was thinking. But enough about me, I'd love to know more about your trip to Ukraine! Such a beautiful country.
Hahaha nope, I don't believe so :p Were they good drunk or were they noticeably messing up?
Yea I gotcha man. Thing is, if I say "fuck yea, I'm so good and I'm gonna be a huge DJ on that stage", then I sound cocky and people bash me for it. Isn't that how reddit works? I hear where you're coming from though, and I didn't mean to sound condescending to myself, I was just weighing the two different ways this can go, lol.
That's awesome! I've always thought about animation and it seems like the coolest thing to learn :p
...but...but he gets to go to /r/lounge :(
Haha no idea why an OP wouldn't want to respond to everyone, this is like my 5 minutes of fame on reddit and I get to talk to a bunch of cool people! Haha no need to thank me though, man, it's all good :p
Haha well thank you anyway! I appreciate it <3
Well, that's what a headliner does :) An opening act just warms the crowd up for the headliner, and even though I have my own music that I can play, I played (past tense, just got home) very coherent music that everyone knows and loves. Examples such as : Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike - Tremor, MammothDVBBS & Vinai - RaveologyJust examples, but songs like these really pump the crowd up. I'm not a huge fan of Martin Garrix, but hearing his new track "Turn Up the Speakers" with Afrojack while I was in the crowd made me jump, regardless of whether or not I dislike it.
>Rock out with your dong out Haha love that saying, but it might sound better by saying "Rock out with your cock out", idk if that was your intention ! :p
Exactly what every OP ever wants to hear :p But seriously though, I'm setting a reminder for 3 months and if you're not headlining EDC 2016 by then, we're gonna have a problem here! Haha :)
Yea, B&H Photo Video is based in NYC, and I visited their superstore a few times. It's such a huge place and it's mindblowing! Happy deal-hunting!
tl;dr you proved my point thanks lol
Then go make them proud!
Lol I can attest I've been on both sides of the tables :P usually house parties ~100 or smaller ^.^ you'll do fine. Can you record your set and paste it some where though? I'd love to hear what your mixing.
Just...just don't play animals.Seriously though, congrats. Dada Life is always a fuckin party and I can't imagine how excited you are. Also, that shit is gonna look REAL good on your resume :D
At the end when I left they were becoming noticeably sloppier but their stage presence was fantastic still
There's a great difference between being cocky and being humble. Choose the latter, appreciate your skills and your success, but people will like you more if you do it in a humble way.
I got gold once, I went to /r/lounge and wondered why the hell that place was even a thing. >.>Then I never went back to it.
Idk, its just my experience. But really cool from you nonetheless. :)
LOL I wanted to say cock but I didn't wanna be vulgar 
Digital sure makes it more affordable.   When I was playing it cost about 15 bucks per track, and the good ones were hard to get unless you had a buddy at the record shop to put it aside for you.   Which make it really tough for a new DJ to get into the game.   Although there is still nothing like playing vinyl.
lolHonestly though if I learned to DJ I'd be perfectly happy with a club gig here and there (*assuming I get good enough, haha), here in Australia the type of music I generally like (mainly minimal techno type music) isn't exactly a huge scene from what I can tell :PGuys like Raresh / Ricardo Villalobos are some of my DJ idols, haha
Haha I'll definitely try :) Thanks !
It was ! I'm surprised they didn't ask me for one! :p
Haha I don't think that's possible man, I'll be spinning on CDJ200s, and aside from some 10 second videos of when the beat drops that I might take, I don't think I can record anything unfortunately
No animals? Fuck, there goes half my set. If I can't play levels either, then the crowd's listening to my spotify playlist, I guess.
Hahaha interesting :p 
Great point man. Did I ever tell you that you're a great person? <3 Keep on keeping on dude :)
Love that. Thanks for it :) Should I go on stage and call the coordinates for an airstrake over the radio, in that case?
Is it that bad there? 
Haha thanks man, it's loads of fun just talking to everyone, you included :)
2naughty4me
Haha yea, I guess vinyl is more for the disc jockeys that want to scratch and stuff, while digital is just for the people that want to play some bangers and make some people go nuts. Haven't seen many big edm artists spin on vinyl, I think.
Haha regardless, get out there and try it out! Maybe you'll play a killer set in front of a huge promoter, and he'll pick you up :p
He also gets artists on his label to do a lot of the work even on non collaborations. 
You should be able to use a external sound card or a pass through that'll allow you to 'split' the signals to a recording device o.o; I'd recommend it if you ain't got it. Record your sessions so you can use it for promo! >*yeah I opened for Dada, this is my mix..*Pantie dropper lol 
Haha I've always wanted to go to Israel with my brothers on a Birth Right trip. It sounds so awesome!And definitely, whatever pictures,videos, experiences I bring back with me I'll for sure share with you!
It's not bad at all - it's just completely empty. People aren't bad, they're kinda nice I guess, but there's literally no real topic. It's just a bunch of random people very rarely talking about random things, with an extremely tacky and ugly "rich"-looking theme (gold background and whatnot). It's just a pointless novelty, not a real forum that people use.
Fuckk. Fuck him man, he's only good for throwing cake at his crowd.
Haha yea in general if I would be bringing my equipment to the club, I'd record the set, but since the change was so last minute (promoter tells me to use the cdjs on Thursday), I didn't have a chance (or the money) to go out and buy something to record my mix.
Yea, birth right is definitely something that I'll be going on once I get older (I'm only 16). And sweet, I can't wait! Haha
Haha interesting. Never really thought of it like that. 
Nope, I stick to electronic music solely. I'm down to listen to almost any sub-genre of edm, though :)
How it start? Did he just PM "Send lunch pic."?
I would absolutely try that chat function! Wouldnt you hate it if she dissappeared and you wouldnt know anything about her?
So how'd you convince him?
Did you get the job? Did he sell the house?
Whoa that's remarkable
I love how online gaming destroys social barriers. I used to play eve, small gang combat, we had a pirate outfit, and it was real trial by fire stuff. If you didn't kill 10 times more players than you died, you would lose money and not be able to afford losses. in our gang we had a 70yr old Norwegian guy, and a 12 yr old Australian kid, we respected their skill and ability equally. 
So romantic. 
I'm reading this as a support group for the now-adult babies who get brought up when the naming statistics come out since they have truly ~~shitty~~  semi-unique names, like abcedef, etc.  I love it  =D
>i am more of a bystander.I think this applies to all of life when you own a cat.
That reminds me of another friend I have.Before Facebook got really strict on names, I made a joke account of John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt (spelling?). I searched, and found another one. I messaged "Your name is my name too!".We messaged back and forwarth for two years before learning our real names (her name is not my name too) and many years later we're good friends who confide in each other. We have yet to meet in person.
how did you write her name on your back with a sharpie? 
Hey, that's pretty gay.
Exes who you can remain on good terms with often make the best of friends, I have found.There's a certain trust that can't be found elsewhere.
Sounds like my family, except im an honorary canadian, not a real one
I've been friends with a lot of people where all I really do is *listen*.  It gives them a chance to get everything off their chest, and try to find a solution to their problems.
I never get any messages or voicemail by accident :( maybe I should get a new phone number, one that seems easy to mistype, lol
Thanks. They actually named me godfather of their kid, even though I've only ever facetimed with the kid.
do you fuq
I have a few friends from minecraft that I have put in many hundreds of hours playing that damn game with them. Like 800+ at least. We would occasionally do build projects for big servers and that took lots of time 
Same situation except we're both only mostly straight and a bit bi
Do it and report back to us! :)
She might be Australian or a vampire.
You both have your own statues?!? :PWhat's a battle rapper though?
Thanks! :)
May I ask why?
In case it never happens, can you summarize?
I've been friends with someone for four years and never met her. Hope I can someday though.
I love that, do you remember any of the stand out names?
That's awesome, I wish my library hosted board game nights. 
Sounds like a smart decision 
You're welcome.My friendship with him has taught me many things, just as much as I taught him, one of which being to not kick people when they are down, even if they might deserve it.That's served me a lot in life.
Before taking my father's last name, I had an extremely common name. He got the wrong guy. He sent me a picture of a quesadilla and from there it snowballed. 
I did the same thing with a guy from India.  We are now friends, I have a bunch of his friends on my FB, we all chat in messenger or post on walls etc.It is always funny when someone says something that makes zero sense without cultural context.
Across the country though. 
Mine would be 5 days of ramen. You really want that?
He does not. I live on the West Coast, he lives on the East coast.
It'd be worse if she turned out to be a neo nazi or something, though. When you have these non-talking relationships, you get to maintain a certain illusion about the other person. 
Sounds like some oddity you'd see in a slight indie movie or something
The app uses your FB profile picture 
Maybe that pun should be my first message to my Yahtzee buddy 
A series of links, personal anecdotes, videos (Adam Ruins Everything, Penn and Teller's Bullshit) and reassurances.
What topics would you want to rant about?
Craigslist. 
I can relate, just two years later than you. Same stuff.
I got into college. I never heard back from him. 
Same here! Except I'm the one that has the firstnamelastname gmail email. She's from Scotland, seems like a really cool gal based on the emails I get.
I have a similar situation too.. Cept it's all business emails and uhWell I know the person they should be going to...Yup I shouldn't be getting those, Not fluent, but hey telling people they have the wrong email in another language helps your language skills a bit I guess? Not that I believe he ever gets them, even when I steer them the right way.
It really is, most of the online friends I've met have talked a while after meeting and I know some for 4 years now.
God, I miss last.fm PMs. I used to have really meaningful conversations with interesting people on there, before the whole site went down the drain.
..and his name?Cristiano Ronaldo
Tbh, it was winter, and it depends where you are, but the kid could have literally died. Depending of course, but it has happened numerous times before.
The only negative I have experienced is when people aren't being truthful. One person from my old group claimed she was an Asian twenty-something college student who got into a skiing accident and had become wheelchair-bound (which is why she had all this time to be in-game).We became friends outside of the game and even on FB, where she claimed she wasn't able to post photos of herself online because of some stalker ex-boyfriend... blah blah blah... Turns out that none of that was true at all. In fact the only part that was true is that she's female.
> my cat has been at her houseHave you ever been to her house or just your cat?
I'm sure some of them are. The guy I made friends with is pretty chill and in retrospect probably was legit, but I guess I really had/have no way of knowing. I would mainly just recommend talking to them for a bit 
memes, dick pics. gosh, some girls just get it all.
I think people have a problem with you implying that almost every guy who makes friends with girls is guilty of sexual harassment. Hence why they're saying you keep bad company- they're trying to tell you those people don't represent men in general.
well, if i was 15ish, i would've just been coming out of my rage comic phaseyou do the math And nah he and i are chillin actually
Thanks! She actually came to my job and brought me a coffee right after I posted this, which makes a solid 2 times we've ever seen each other in person. She's a great girl, and it's so relieving to be able to talk to her as a friend without the "pressure" of trying to look cool. Especially as someone who's struggled with social anxiety, it's been a real help. Plus I get a buddy to talk about Game of Thrones without it devolving into "I'd ride Danny's dragons wink wink" like my other friends
Nah, it was the first and last time I ever stepped foot inside.  I wanted to ask him about his choices in home decor, but I was too busy with failing at trying not to cry.  I sometimes think back and wonder if he did work on movie sets or something, because every wall had at least three taxidermy owls and one suit of armour.  Strangest place I've seen tbh.
> her name is not my name tooBut can you imagine how frickin awesome it would have been if it was?
haha!  I just hung out with an old LiveJournal friend just this past Sunday!  It blows my mind that we're still friends 15 years  after meeting in a comment thread of a mutual friend's LJ.
Maybe it was just a short name like Eve.
Dominant/submissive I believe. It's a BDSM thing. 
It was more on my side, but it was out of the way enough for me to not notice it when I took my shirt off.
And that's okay
/r/bee_irl
I ask him for a lot of advice on personal things. We have even been able to calmly talk about our relationship and what happened. 
Friends?  Sounds more like therapy, which is good too!
That would make sense, she's one of the most troubled people I've ever met. She's basically the living embodiment of the paranoid parrot. She's also very needy and I've had to set boundaries with her.Thanks for the kind words. Admittedly, it's been good for me too. I wasn't blessed with a lot of empathy and I don't have a nurturing bone in my body. My experience with her has been a good opportunity to learn how to be empathetic, and how to be encouraging.
The old guy is gonna help him get the girl 
How old are you now?
Both of us are chicks and tho im mildly gay, noBut ngl i would but shes straight and its not worth to push it
We are really great friends, its just instead of casual pranks, its sincere attempts at black mail, extortion and entrapment. We never actually break the law, its more about getting the other into a place of check/check mate. Glad you liked it anyway.
it is what it is, if no-body cares or don't believe me, I lose nothing from it. I get paid fairly well, thats enough recognition for me. I did feel however, That the nature of our relationship, the ability and level we work at, was integral to explaining the relationship. I won't lie, there isn't a lot of people who do what we do, so saying I'm the best loses some gravity in that context.
Yeah how we joke with each other generally would be considered "hardcore flirting"
Actually I think we need to get r/SCP on this one.
It was quite obvious. I think I even used sarcasm in my reply. 
Man, it's a cool thing. I met her probably... 12 years after we became friends. It was the most natural thing in the world. 
100%. I would not recommend you follow my example.
I was a gym leader. All the pokemon were ones that were in the original 150, as that's when this chat was started / popular. 
This is fucking brilliant!Do you only send lunches? Is it all lunches, including the average boring ones or just the more interesting ones?
/r/indianpeoplefacebook is pretty great.  That sounds like fun.
Hey I'm Hungarian! I can be the third wheel in your friendship and translate for you! 
PS that is a fantastic username dude. Bravo.
Pm-me-ur-breakfast clearly should have been my real screen name.
Interesting. Is he from NY?
yea, casually mentioned and maybe a little shown on camera, but otherwise forgotten. of course, it could be the main theme too. maybe something along the lines of this relationship, although odd and perhaps unconventional, helps the protagonist cope emotionally. or, maybe the games stop one day and the protagonist finds her and meets her on her death bed. they look into each others' eyes and share a bond unlikely. 
Nice. How long'd it take?
Ah, that answers all my questions
I could have been the love story of the century, and you tossed it all away for your schooling
I love this. What a time to be alive.
If it makes you feel any better I married mine, lolPretty much an exact replica of story above except a different (happier) ending <3
I guess so. I live in London and have lived as an expat in the Middle East and you wouldn't dream of getting in somebody's car if you were a kid. In London it gets cold but not killer cold. Loads of kids walk to school. They usually close if the rain or snow or weather in general is really bad.
> Child kidnappers don't exactly drive around in vehicles and ask to give kids rides.Some of them actually do, though.
I had a group of friends that i'd play Halo 3 with - no idea who they ere but we chatted every night. Even had battles where we stopped fighting to take big group photo's! - I might see if I still have any of their details...what a flashback!
I haven't seen it in forever since Netflix took it off, and I have no idea what my local pbs station is let alone if they show it. 
hey its me ur meme bud
"Not all men" or not, it happens WAY more often than anyone is willing to admit.  This is a problem.
I live in the Seattle area, and can confirm that I have terrible luck in life.
I can guarantee that they aren't mentioning it.  I'm 34, but I know women from the ages of 14-50 who have had this happen to them on several occasions.  I'm really surprised that more dudes aren't aware of this.
Bro you talk like a fuckin' californian lmao. I know this is late but i'm browsing top of all on this sub rn, so yeah. 
I need a game of thrones friend
No reason needed, it's just a peculiar object to own. I find them awesome in the right decorational setting.
Admittedly, I was slightly disappointed.But my IRL name is pretty unique in that it comes my first name is of Hebrew, middle name Latin, and last name Norwegian origins.So I'd actually be shocked to find someone with my exact name.
That too, it's pretty short and I've gotten really good at it over time.
Impressive!
Not a lot of empathy, you say? Ever tried cooking before?
To be fair he didn't say that all or most chefs are sociopaths, just that it correlates with being one. It probably correlates with lots of other shit as well, nbd
You missed the part where OP has sex with every other character 
kinky shite bucko
Either she's mistaken or you're mistaken
That's a bloody cool sub.
With the way my friend is if I ever meet her it'll be in at least 12 years lol
How active was the chat? How many members?It sounds like it would have been fun.
Every now and then it'll be more than lunch. But primarily it's lunch. And usually just the interesting ones. That's how we met. He didn't send like an average quesadilla, he had basically combined barbeque ribs and a quesadilla. Mainly we just swap recipes for bad food back and forth. 
Just whatever. But it's mostly lunch. He made chili recently for dinner, and instead of using saltine crackers alongside it, he used cheezits.Inspiring. 
Thanks for stealing an hour of my life
Is it Catch 22? I am not great at doing maths in my head but I think that's what the binary is.
Holy crap, exactly what I was thinking, but I struggled to define it. !! I want this movie
It was over a period of two days, right around New Years this past year.
It was an unrelated post
I mean the issue comes when literally none of my friends acts like they do it, and they usually admit some oddly intimate details about themselves. So to guys like me, it just seems odd for it to be common.
I'm a guy with a lot of female friends and I'm definitely aware of it. I think it is the minority of guys who do it, but it is a significant enough number to happen disturbingly often. I just don't get how some of my peers aren't aware that this is basically sexual harassment. Not okay at all. 
i've been told that before lol. it's even worse in personi was raised right next to the beach so it's stereotypical surfer dude talk
Send me a message when s7 starts back up!
Thought I was the only one! My first name is Hebrew and my last name is Norwegian as well. My middle name isn't really Latin, though (it's from a Latinate language, but derived originally from a Germanic given name).
Good on you mate :) If I tried to write on my back I'd probably hurt myself.
Not exactly, though that's how I pass it off to people that get too nosy lol. I'm not totally familiar with what exactly life coaches do, so I may be way off. But I just get immense pleasure from making Her as happy and fulfilled as She can be, and am absolutely willing to give up whatever it takes to get Her there. I can't explain why I feel that way, I just do. Also not sure how sexual life coaches are, but there's a lot of that.
I want a refund, my Murakami novel didn't have any sex.. okay it had one and a half sex now that I think about it
The jazz music, damn this right here is the clincher. I think almost all of Murakami's books I've read has jazz music as either a minor theme, or an (imagined) aural muzak. 
Those who observe us tell us that and we get it a lot, but we're clear on where we are in our friendship. What other people think is their business, just as how we interact is ours.
The SCP Foundation is a collaborative writing site where people write articles about different "Special Containment Procedures" for supernatural or otherwise inexplicable-to-science creatures, objects and places, by the titular foundation, whose motto is to "Secure, Contain, Protect".
It was a lot of fun. It was very active as the internet was what most of us did back then - wake up, eat breakfast, go online. That said, there weren't a ton of people. Maybe ~15 who were on constantly and 10 or so more who came on and left from time to time. Made for a nice tight knit community. Started with pokemon, but became a close group after the pokemon craze wore off. 
This has to become a twitter account or something lol
This man is a culinary genius
Yes, Catch 22.
it would be a nice movie!
Nice.Sounds like a sweet way to make some holiday cash.Though it reminds me of the pranks people play where they put up adds saying "Win an XBox" and then they require a credit card number. They then take a camera crew to the houses of people who actually "fell" for it.You could have easily been feeding some dude's fetish.
And now I have so many more.
> I don't know how she thought I bought all the dumb stuff she claimed.people believe what they want to believe. They would rather think you bought it, and think the best of them, then think they have been caught out and humiliated.
When does somebody acting like "they never would" mean that it doesn't happen.  There's a few girls in this thread who just admitted that it has happened to them.  Just because the guys and girls in your life aren't talking about it, doesn't mean that this isn't a regular occurrence. I'm pretty sure wouldn't want admit to my friends if I sent unsolicited sexual images to anyone, would you?  And on the flip side, why would I tell my guy friends when they'll just imply that it happened because I was talking to a guy who must have gotten past my faulty character judgment filter.
>  I think it is the minority of guys who do it, but it is a significant enough number to happen disturbingly often.This.  To totally bite a term from the LGBTQ community, but we need more allies to be vocal about this.  It's not basically sexual harassment.  It IS sexual harassment.  And a lot of guys who have thought of doing it, or who actually have don't realize this.  Even if they're not the type who would consciously sexually harass someone.  Honestly, most of the unsolicited dick pics I've received were from drunk guys who would never when they were sober.
Huh, that's fascinating to me
I agree completely! I would donate ten bucks to it, if i could do it easily in person lol.
My first thought was that he was jerking off to whatever I was sending him, but the more I got into links about body positivity and the origin of why circumcision is a commonly-accepted, non-medical trend, the less I cared. Then the money showed up. He didn't have any information that could have been compromising for me, so I wasn't worried.His rationale was that he'd rather spend money on getting someone to talk him off the edge than on the surgery and pain of recovery. Worst-case scenario, he was jerking off. Best-case scenario, he didn't get the surgery. Either way, $350 is $350.
Yeah, I mean I admit it's super weird, but I'm,  dare I say,  fairly normal outside of it? I certainly don't flaunt it, pretty sure none of my friends have any idea.
lol same. idk even where to start making a movie.
You're a cool person.
I've a good camera, can you act?
Thanks, so are you.
It did made me cry. Can't stop my tears D:
I totally agree about the Anime, it's weird how I'm fine during the saddest scenes in normal film/tv but the moment that slow piano marks the beginning of a sad scene in an Anime, the waterworks begin.
Don't you cry.. tonight..
Sometimes we forget that they also age. I can't and don't want to imagine a world without my dad or my mom, but of course it's inevitable. All we can do for the time being is cherish them and let them know that we care and love them. Once they are gone, you won't live your life thinking that you could have done more.
I am so very sorry for your loss.*Nana internet hug*
Creepingly hilarious. Thank you!
Except it did...
*Nana internet hug*Let the emotion flow - it's a good thing :)
*Nana internet hug*
Can I get a hug too? :'( let's all have a hug party.^(lost my dad recently) 
I am so very sorry for your loss. Maybe you weren't a very good son as you think; however, we generally are much too self-critical when it comes to our own actions. I'm thinking he not only loved you but thought well of you too.You take care.*Nana internet hug*
I'm really sorry about that. I'm old enough to know that some things just can't be fixed, but it's still upsetting since I grew up thinking that my parents were very much in love and happy. I have actually spent a lot of time with my dad. He's the one that's hurt the most and definitely needs the company. 
Op, your a good man and a great son.
OMG /r/sadcringe is real!  I had no idea!
Oh no, I'm not trying to side with anyone but I've just been more close with him as of late because it's been a lot harder for him. I'm not saying that my mom isn't upset but I know she's not as upset as he is. He's trying to end things on a good note, despite her being extremely rude, but she's just not having it. 
Love you dearly Andrew. 
Now I'm cying.
I cried over yesterday's Sailor Moon Crystal. You're right about the music!Although not just anime. I was practicing the piano the other day and made myself sad by playing through the music from a certain scene in Final Fantasy VII... 
Nah my man white album two trust me. You thought your lie in April was bad. 
Hi (Reddit's) Grandma! I always smile when I see you in a thread.I hope you are well.
shh bby is ok
My dad passed away just over a month ago. My addendum to the well wishers has been: go make some more good memories with your kids/parents. 
thank you hiyo, for the Nana internet hug. *hugs back*
AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LUCKJESS!!*I have ^missed ^^you*
I am so sorry for your loss.*Nana internet hug*
Awww thank you. May have shed a happy tear. The gesture is very kind of you.  :')
Thank you :) I know he was proud, but man I wish I could do it all over again!
Great, now you've all made me cry. 
Is it the one where Sephiroth dies? 
Shigatsu, WA2, Ano Hana, 5cm/s got me to tear up a little, Sakamichi no Apollon and Plastic Memories almost had me, particularly Sakamichi with the music.
Aw - thank you! It's good to be seen! :)I am quite well thanks! :) I hope you are doing well too! :)
My condolences, will do.
You are so welcome.*Takes in hug*You take care of yourself.
Me too! But my aim is getting better!
Sorry for the late reply.I really appreciate your well-thought out response. The feeling and loss is still raw for me (he passed away around 3 months ago) but yes I definitely am keeping him alive in my thoughts and memories. What pains me is watching my mother trying to brace herself. She lost her best friend, her only love. I can't imagine worse loss than that. I hope we can get through this, no matter how difficult. I wish you all the best too. They might have been gone but they live in us as long as we keep them in memory. :')
You are most welcome :)Take care!
Be the best person you can be - that will be his best legacy.
Well, now everyone's crying. Are you happy now?
Nope. Aeris! 
Lol lets all agree clannad after story. 
Hell yeah, that's the Jess I know! I am calling you by an abbreviation of your username because we are now best friends (Assuming your name is Jess).
What you have to understand, you see, is that those aren't tears of sadness, but of joy. OP made his old man happy today. Now dry your tears and go give your father a call or, even better, a hug.
Wtf? Spoilers! 
*"Not all tears are an Evil."     -Gandalf*
DARTH VADER IS LUKES FATHER SHIEK IS ZELDA SAMUS IS A GIRL
Good question. There is always the possibility that someone hasn't watched/played/read something that was made long ago but they still might at some point. But when it's about something so popular it's impossible to remain unspoiled forever
I'm just owning up to my mistakes:  Stealing jokes from Gravity Falls!
What if you weren't born yet?
Rightttttt, when was your last one then and why them?
Same here! I've also had romantic crushes turn into these. Once all the "OMG DATE ME" feelings had faded cause it didn't look like it was going any further, it became a "man, they're really really cool. I wish we were closer." I'm pretty good at getting close to people, but terrible at convincing myself to make the first couple moves. I've got the tricks up my sleeve, just lack the confidence to pull them outta my sleeve! I wonder how close we would've gotten if I just tried a little harder. Oh well. Better luck next time, right?
Thats adorable lmao
Who was your latest friendship crush and why? :)
People and socialization is scary. As generic as the thing Im going to say now, it does get better with time. Do one thing every day which would help you with it :)
This whole sub is generally wholesome. It's basically /r/WholesomeMemes before /r/WholesomeMemes were a thing.
Thats definitely a tricky one, such a shame that there needs to be immediate assumptions when it comes to socialization between girls/guys. 
Aww! Don't worry. I guess I just kinda merged myself into conversations etc? Isn't that easy I know. Took me a year and a half in my last school, but ended up being so worth it. Making good friends is such a trial and error kind of process. However though, just be nice to her and be the kind of person you'd want to get to know :) Have you ever talked to her/how do you know her anyway?
Never really had it either. Sure, I have plenty of times when I'm like hey he seems to be a cool dude I should try to talk to him more. But to get really excited about the idea of befriending them? Not really.
Yeaaah, genuinely compassionate/kind people really catch my eye also, I really look for that
This is actually how I met my best friends a decade back!! It also felt like that at first - that they were nice and all but I wasn't really in the group - but that changed after awhile. I think some of them are still closer because of the history, but it definitely changed a lot from the beginning and they've been such great best friends that they've given me high standards (and faith!) in people :)
What's the plot to it? I'd like to watch this.
Omg this is lovely to hear haha!!
Finally, I find a comment like this.
yeh in a time constraint you say it, those exact words, and how you feel, knowing the person so far. works ervytyme. thyre gone aneewe lol beteer next book and theatre person
Yes! I love when this happens!
They're like mental practice that won't happen exactly that way.
Glad to hear you guys got closer!! :)
Not at all!
don't get discouraged, it's usually nothing personal and has to do with them! I mean yeah it is literally personal, but it has to do with what they think, and that's based on their experiences etc.I actually met my incredible best friend group a decade back putting myself out there (basically at this event together and I said that my friends' table was full - sorta true - could i sit with them? and then i just kept doing that whenever that larger friend group got together, and then i invited them to hangout personally)
I personally feel like I don't naturally have a lot to add to a friendship, and that I could but it would take a lot of effort.   Like, I would feel under pressure to be interesting/cool/funny whatever.
Same, but this thread is making me change my mind.
Don't be sad.
My romantic and friend crushes seem to always be separate, but it makes sense how they'd overlap.I wish I knew how to get close to people. I don't have any trouble making friends, but that's because it's never a conscious thing for me, they just kind of develop without my choosing.
Hang with him> I see what you did there
So real lol. Happens to me all the time.
{I'm a guy} Just yesterday, I became really good friends with this girl that I have had a "friendship crush" on for a while. I use photography as a way to enter people into my life. I just asked her if We could hang out to let me take photos of her. I've only talked to her a couple times because of mutual friends. It was supposed to be for around an hour, but we ended up hanging out for an entire day in Princeton, and it was a ton of fun! 
Yep. I try to do that. I'm pretty fine with talking to people (I didn't actually start talking to people other than family and close friends till I was like 16) now. I just cant talk to girls still. I turn into an awkward mess who would avoid eye contact even if there was a loaded gun pointed at my head.
omg we're besties nowwwwwwwwwwww
I really miss the childhood simplicity of just going up to someone and asking if they want to be friends.
I met her at a birthday party, we only talked at little bit. Only later I realized how cute she was. Also, I'm friends with her sister which makes it double-weird. She's one year older than me and graduates in two months or so, my time is running up. :(My problem is that I get really distant and cold when she's around because I don't know how to act. I'm kind of socially anxious. Don't want her to think I'm weird.Sorry for hijacking your thread, this isn't really what you wanted to know haha.
We haven't really talked since then, not even "how are you?"-conversations. And I'm too scared to approach her anyway. I can't message her anywhere without coming off as creepy since she doesn't really know me and never gave me her number or snapchat name. But I'm friends with her twin sister, so I already know where she lives and that she has a dog and stuff. My only chance is talking to her at another friend's party in like a month. I hope she'll be there too. 
Oh totally, it's nice to be able to approach people with a specific proposition and get to know them along the way
Same. Closest that's ever happened to me is when I've wanted to wiggle my way into a local scene in a new city and meet someone I think could introduce me. Hasn't worked so far lol
No but you seem cool! Let's be friends
I just watched one the other night, where Elaine has this really cool attractive boyfriend and George is obsessed with him. They go rock climbing. That should give you something to watch, not sure if it was the episode /u/jp5384 was talking about, just a coincidence that I'd seen it! 
I'm glad you can relate. What's your story? 
> "try the best you can, the best you can is good enoughDid you just quote radiohead? 
I'm so glad you posted this. Thank you 
I've found the best method for breaking through to the close stage is to let your guard down a little. My favorite method is sharing a funny yet embarrassing story, like showing them pictures of my scene phase. By showing a sliiiightly more personal side of you, it shows you trust them - which typically leads to them trusting you too. 
Sorry? Is what I wrote a joke or something?
Yasssss well done! Im glad to hear that. I've noticed people with cameras and good photography skills often gain a lot of friends through it, probably because it seems so engaging and also "can i take photos of you" is such a flattering question. :)
You're wrong, your response was exactly the kind I wanted to have: I want to know everyones experiences. It's okay to be nervous in these situations, I know what you mean cos you tend to really care about the persons opinion of you/the situation. I guess you could be casual about it and ask what she going to do after grad, steer it from there? Probably a conversation you've already had though or something. 
So many lovely people here god damn, Id love to!
Yes I did! I will carry that verse with me and never let go :)
Next time you see him reading a book you want to have a chat about, walk past and all nonchalantly say 'nice tattoo bro, I love that band!" And then say something like "oh dude, that's an awesome book, you've got great taste" and boom, conversation started!
You said slightly personal. I'll only show those once my soulmate is legally bound to me through a state approved marriage.
Oh dear. Well I guess I'm bound by the sacred internet law of no bamboozles now!
I suppose. Time will tell for certain though. 
Gonna be a bit narcissistic here, but I have this awesome line that I love using:"Hey, why would you ask me out of anyone to take photos of people?""Well, that's the issue with portrait photography; I can do everything correctly, but I still need someone attractive for the picture to be perfect."
I realized that, but i kinda hoped the rest of my messages would indicate that it was meant positively and/or in excitement. Oh wells though
Hahaha. I've still got a lot of the same friends from that time period, so I've accepted those pictures will haunt me whether I'm poking light at them or not lol! 
I'll give you gold if you do it. I know it's meaningless, but I feel like adding a bit more incentive to it. Carpe diem. 
No doubt at all that it works on people!
Well, at least we have the internet for that now.  Must've sucked to like an obscure thing before the internet was around, heh.
The power is yours haha 
Same here.
Gave you one!
Holy cannoli.
I've been found out!
You heard correctly! I'm giving them away at least.
Mobile doesn't have fancy stuff like pictures in flairs, special up/downvote buttons or messages.
Of course, why not? Here you go
Nothing. Its chilled, people are nice. Thats about it. Welcome :)
I haven't! That costs real money right?
Thank you!
Upvote dispatched.
Exactly! I love when someone takes that second to upvote something I've said.
We need a super upvote!
There's one from me!
That's what I've been trying to do! Haha I've upvoted every single comment and replied to probably 75% of them. I'm about to go to sleep though so I'll have some catching up to do. 
I'm really glad you did that, too, because it helped me find dropped threads easier.It's Shiva's birthday today. Wanna tell her anything or wish her a happi birthday? Promise I'll tell her :D
Ooh, I'm gonna start doing that too! Why did I never think of it. 
Phew, I just upvoted every top-level comment :D
Good advice.
Never too late! Upvoted!
I've upvoted you. Now you know :)
Yassss I need this in my life!
Yep! Upvoted!
Upvote from me!
If someone upvotes something I've said or posted, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. (It's the little things!) I'm trying to learn to return the favor.
Exactly why I've made it my mission to upvote more posts and comments.
Believe it or not, I just wanted to share my revelation about how terrible I am at upvoting. I was shocked when I woke up and the thread had over 2k upvotes.
"Your heart is a strange little orange to peel." Not sure how I feel about that one.
It says "butts!" when I upvote your comment. hahaha. 
Go on to  chrome app, then go to the reddit website. When you get there, click in the top right hand corner (three little dots) and then click *request desktop site* and when you visit the sub it will let you see the quotes when you up vote.  
Yes this appears on PC website only, it appears! Sorry mobile users 
Go on to the chrome app and open reddit, then click in the top right hand corner on three little dots and *request desktop site* then it will load reddit like it would on a pc or laptop and you can see the css and, by extension, the little quotes.
What's the next?
So, uh...got any cars? :P 
I've always been curious how much the taxes on those cars were.  *Edit. I found it. Some audience members had to pay up to $6000 in taxes to keep the car. Yikes. 
I guess I'm giving them away too now! 
we all get upvotes?
Yes! I'll be your guinea pig if you want! 
Thank you kindly.
That's some fine work there son. Keep it up.
I casually understand.
I also got the orange one. I wonder how the quotes are distributed.
/r/ProCSS 
Wait what? I've been using Reddit for going on four years and *I've never known this?*
Pretty standard.  I used to work at a dealership that "gave away" a contest car occasionally and I think most people just took a cash prize (sold the car back to the dealership, really) instead because they weren't prepared for the tax hit.  Everybody pays that tax when they buy a car but it's built into the payments usually.  Paying it on the spot when you weren't really expecting it can put a real dent in your wallet if you can afford it at all.
I generally use upvotes to save stuff, and if it is a comment or archived, I'll use the "save" function.
Everyone who comments on this thread at least lol.
I'm good! I'm super pleased that so many people appreciate this post. I've never had one get so many upvotes and comments. How are you?
Update: I'm now awake and speed upvoting through the thread that mildly blew up. 
You're adorable! <3
I've never had one. How do they taste?
Hey someone gave you one for me!
every comment has its own ID you can see when you permalink it, i think it's generated off of that ID, so everyone gets the same message for the same comment.
Wait... Reddit is trying to remove CSS? Why? How am I supposed to browse /r/ooer now?
I'd probably go with the cash prize too. I know 6K would put me in the red. 
wow srsly??
I'm doing well, glad to see the wholesomeness in this thread thanks to you! : )
Don't do it, the music will be stuck in your head for a month
Oh stop it! Hug <3
Horrible as hell. They just taste like a bunch of vitamins and minerals.
Another sub that does it has it based on the last letter of your comment. 
Hey I appreciate that information. Thanks for that.
Yeah so far I've upvoted every comment.
Awe I'm glad to hear that and yes, I think it's great!
Yeah I just up and moved 13 hours away from where I grew up. I did have a plan for where I'd live with some family but that fell through. I couldn't get an apartment quickly enough (plus I didn't have enough saved for first, last, and security deposit) so this is what I fell back on. I'm working two jobs so soon I should be able to turn it around eventually!
yuck. I usually just take caffeine pills if i need a boost, but for some reason i've lost my ability to swallow pills recently so that hasn't worked for me. Pure caffeine tastes awful, it's got to be more bitter than a switch cartridge.
What are your favorite math songs?
Good luck! If you don't mind me asking, how old are you? And any thoughts on moving back to hit the reset button? 
Yes! the 5 hour was so bitter, that was the description I was looking for. It has over 1000 mg of "energy" they say.
wow! thats a lot of mg of energy lol. theres surely no way its worse than pure caffeine though. the second the stuff dissolved in my mouth i almost threw up. i literally gagged for minutes.
1000 mg = 1 gram.I would not recommend that anymore then.
Glad to hear it. I enjoying hearing people enjoy hearing math.
one whole entire gram of pure *energy*
Thank you! 
Ah, such a great story times two! 
Unless there's a fire.
Yay! Great outcome! 
Aww, thanks, me too! 
What a great story! 
Wow, fantastic story! The shipping part made me laugh. Good for you for mailing cash back! 
That, too, happened to me once. Wallet turned in to lost and found, minus the $80. At the time, I felt grateful to have my cards and told myself that person must need the cash more than me. Anger would've been a wasted emotion. Although, I clearly am not the most responsible with wallets if this has happened to me twice. Chain wallet, here I come! ;)
I've dropped my wallet countless of times here in Vegas and people always point it out to me if they notice it. I've never forgotten it though. 
Well thank you, but my lenders disagree with you! 
No, I was shaking from a panic attack (long drive back there, freaking out) combined with shock, relief, gratitude... I could not speak except to say "thank you! Thank you soooo much!" But I ought to go back there and make it known how grateful I am!
Thank you for your kind words and wishes! 
That's very sweet, but there are far more deserving folks out there than me! 
I wondered about that too. Usually bank accounts can only be garnished with a court order, which the account owner should be aware of...
Yes! Same here! When I found a wallet, I tracked the person down and returned it in tact! It's just the right thing to do! 
Taiwan is literally the best. Everyone is so chill and nice there.
Its fairly common for people to throw this around especially young people who haven't been touched by it. I just try to chalk it up to that. Good comment though. I had just decided to let it go. 
Thanks! I celebrated with lasagna and carrot cake! 
I know, it didn't occur to me either! Literally down to the last penny. 
I wish I knew who it was so I could reward them! One time I found a wallet outside my apartment, looked up the kid on Facebook, and he came to pick it up. He nervously looked in it to see his $300 still inside, and the look of relief that flushed over his face was payment enough. I was super broke at the time  (hmm, a pattern is emerging here, maybe my life choices could be better), but it didn't even occur to me to take any. So maybe this is that karma returning to me. :) Thanks, universe! 
Yes, it truly is! Yay, that's great! 
Yayyyyyyyy! Good ending! 
Thank you! That's a good idea! My ex offered me use of his safe but... yeah, not a great idea for a plethora of reasons. 
Over where? America? Yea. They're all over the place.
Haha, yeah, I'd be the only one with  $400 in my offshore account! Yes, going forward I can and will set up a payment plan to prevent it from happening again. It's just... I scrambled so hard to save that, and now my escape plans are dashed. Just feels like a punch in the face. Totally my fault, it just sucks. 
That's really great of you to do! 
Thanks, me too! 
Thanks. I would have had more options had I not ignored the letters. Totally my fault. Turns out living in denial doesn't solve your problems! 
Hooray! Thank goodness for good souls! 
Hell yea cheapest place to buy groceries here. I don't shop anywhere else unless they don't have something.
Thank you!
Thank you for your kind words and kind offer. I appreciate it! 
Hmm, that's so odd! Maybe you just have amazing taste in no resale value stuff! "Forget the cash, she has an eos ball in honeydew!" 
I gotta get, I got-got ta get it!
I have not, but I will look into it, thank you! That payment amount is awfully affordable! 
Happy to share the good out there! 
Wowza, that's wonderful! 
Wow, lucky! Good tip, thanks! 
I know, right!? Hooray for happy outcomes!
Yes, I am sooo relieved!!!
Yes, absolutely! 
Excellent story! Thanks for sharing! 
Truly they are! 
Yeah, great point. Probably not the best word choice. I should have said I felt violated. 
Thanks, kid! 
Well, we have a governor who gutted the program, so his (any many other's) benefits went way down. It's terrible. 
Thank you! 
Thanks for being honest! It shouldn't be a shocking thing! 
Yeah, for sure, wish I would've jumped on that ship years ago. 
Holy mother of love, I'm so sorry. I can relate to the total emptiness/betrayal/horror/fear that action brings. Sending love and light that your situation takes a turn for the better soon! 
Wowwww! Props to you! You could've taken the money and felt guilty about it, but you did the right thing and still got the money! 
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
I got so annoyed with the girl in this story that I had to stop myself from reflexively downvoting your comment. That's really irritating that she reacted that way!
Financial tip: $ isn't exclusive to the US. Sometimes there are two lines through it though.
Some people don't like being the center of attention.
:( Good on you though!
I think people just talk about it more when it happens that a wallet is returned. When a family member lost his wallet, it was not returned and the thieves charged as much as possible on the cards in the wallet.  We didn't post about it or talk about it much, because it's kind of what we expected.  But maybe I'm cynical.
Thanks me too
The other side of that is that there are unfortunately plenty of jerks out there as well!
Actually, no. He did pay for a new tire otherwise the car couldnt have been driven safely. The rest of the damage was cosmetic and it wont effect what VW is paying me for the car, so I figured I'd give the guy a break. He was good enough to leave his contact info. could have easily just left.
And I absolutely know that you'll have the same experience in the future when you find a lost wallet or purse. :) 
Or attack by manbabies
Until it goes up in flames for the (nonexistent) insurance money! 
Unless I'm wrong I believe this was levied by the state, school tuition? If it's the government you are screwed. 
Thanks bud! I liked your story too! 
Try that in a convenience store on Boulder Hwy and let me know how it works out for you. 
Glad you enjoyed it! We were all very impressed at how well the guy who found his bag handled it.  I'm glad my friend let him keep the goodies because the finder was the real MVP of the weekend.
Nobody can donate to them all. 
The credit union could be owned by the university itself.
Or they could have sent OP a letter about it that be ignored, because it was just one of a more than weekly letter saying OP owed money. When I owed money to a private college, they sent me so many letters.
There are valid reasons one could fall behind on student debt, especially considering universities in the US never stop taking money from you.
> And thus not really using any of their services that are paid for by taxesThe US military provide worldwide service. Shipping without the USNAVY would be fucked. 
For people who have the means and opportunity, they really should consider visiting. They won't be disappointed.
Well, good luck on your escape. 
I know, it's fantastic! I bought 2 dozen eggs there this summer for 39 cents each! 
Anytime.  Pm me anytime if you'd like.
You really should look into it. I pay $5/month and I make a decent-ish income.
Exactly! Thanks. 
That just makes me sad. I hope that there are organisations around that are able to help them.
Bitcoin is on sale right now ;) it'll be back up in the coming months
different states have different laws
I believe in karma, but what's funny is when I counted it the night I found it, there was $5400. *shrugs* I wasn't going to say no to a free envelope of money.
It's so petty but it still annoys me to this day.
Completely agree. I would rather my act go completely unnoticed than to have it made public like that. 
Yeah, at least your_ex_girlfriend isn't an asshole
I love this! Unless of course it's from a wallet with ID, haha. But loose money on the ground, that's a beautiful thing to do! 
Maybe I'm an optimist!
I love that word, sassafrass
Me too thanks
Oh for sure! I have in the past, and will if it ever comes up again! 
Or babymen
He's a flamer.
Yes, the state. 
Yes, for sure! Amazing story all around!  Of all the ways that could've gone poorly, it went just exactly perfectly! 
True, but I'm positive I should be very low on the list of people who should be given money. I ate today. I can brush my teeth with clean, running water. I'm very lucky. 
This! Although in the letter afterwards made it sound like they had the right to do it to any financial institution. I'm sure it was in the fine print somewhere. 
Yes, I absolutely did ignore letters, though they didn't state that this was in their arsenal.
Well I mean if this person could set $1,400 back I'm pretty sure they could pay *something* on their debt. Usually creditors will not straight up take your money if you are at least putting something towards it, even if it is below the minimum payment. 
Why not charge *everyone* then? Absolutely everyone that uses any forms of shipping.Just because I was born there and moved away doesn't mean that I am more reliant on the military than someone who was born in the UK.
UK here, and if you play it well you can get a good 3% on up to around 20k, plus 5% on 5k. All adds up pretty well, so I agree.That said this time next week I may have to eat my words...
Totally. Even though Japan, Korea, China and Thailand are usually westerners' top choice for visiting Asia, I've enjoyed Taiwan more than all of them. And I've only been to Taipei so far!
Well, both suck. My credit is destroyed. But not my spirit! This too shall pass... eventually! 
yeah i saw eggs at that price around easter - they're usually 99 cents at my aldi which is still about 3x lower than the local chain grocery.
Thank you! 
Nice! I'll look into it, thanks! 
Yeah, but the term has legitimate uses that are non sexual. Paraphrased fom dictionary.com:*rape**noun**an act of plunder, violent seizure, or abuse; despoliation; violation:the rape of the countryside.**the act of seizing and carrying off by force.**verb**to plunder (a place); despoil:The logging operation raped a wide tract of forest without regard for the environmental impact of their harvesting practices.*I think I used it appropriately. 
Oooooh, intriguing.
I agree with you and also think that I may just not be versed enough in laws to say.
Hmm, odd. Still great though! 
Who's to say he didn't ? 
Brasil uses R$ and U$ in situations where there would otherwise be ambiguity (the R$ signifying real, the Brazilian currency, pronounced hey-ahll or rey-ahll depending on region) but often just $ when everyone knows that they mean R$.
The Barnes and Noble on 76th?
Asshole? No. Stupid bitch? Yes... I miss her so much. 
This is weird but I love the way you said that.
I would have done the same!
Me too! So many uses! Sometimes when I'm a bit angrier I use the word sasshole. :)
Y...you too
Great now I'm imagining a bunch of hulked out bearded babies charging from one side with a bunch of diaper wearing, crying middle aged men with giant lollipops charging from the other side. Shits the stuff of nightmares. 
It might've been in one of the ignored letters.
Did you not read why was he saving that money? Trust me I would rather own 1 million in debt than leave in a abusive house/relationship
Because they probably only have the power to tax citizens. Just pointing out that people abroad still use services. 
That's the one! 
Shh bby is gun b ok
Haha, thanks. I'm a weirdo. 
Oh, I'm sure it was. Turns out debts are not like teeth, ignoring them will not make them go away. 
Yes! This! Yes, I should have been paying something. But I was/am so desperate to get out of where I am that I made the choice to prioritize my emotional wellbeing.
I don't remember all the details as this was a very long time ago but we DID do everything right. Thanks for the fucking downvotes. 
Oh. I was wrong then lol.
It's like so totally ordered.

Time to get a divorce everyone /s
It was declared a constitutional right by the Supreme Court.  Supreme court issues don't get voted on by the public.Any same-sex ban at the state level is now illegal federally. edit// yo, don't downvote the parent, they asked a legit question 
I was? Aww... 
I understand it's a meme, but I'd rather see "Thanks SCOTUS." Even in Obama's speech he gave credit to SCOTUS and all the activists and LGBT supporters over the many years and left himself totally out of it.
Ugh, can I come live with you?! Compared to the States, New Zealand seems like such an adventure! :D
Canada's had marriage equality since 2005, what do we win?But seriously, congrats to both of your countries.
Poor ol' Donatello never gets any love.
What I don't get (and I'm an atheist) is why even bother with marriage as homosexuals? Marriage is a religious concept and all major religions are against marriage other than between man and woman, so why do they want to be part of something that denies them by definition? It confuses me.
Let's let them find out on their own. :D
My upquote called you a "cutiebutt".

dude your flair is fucking awesome!
Mine was actually quite bubbly (Living in a red state). You might just be following the wrong friends.  
Texas was trying to deal with a federal District case that went against them, and *four* state level cases with *different* outcomes. Meanwhile, the Fifth Circuit had Texas's District case, as well as cases from Louisiana and Mississippi, again with contrary rulings. As soon as the Circuit learned of the appeal of the Sixth Circuit ruling, they decided to wait and see, which was a lot easier than dealing with it all. And everyone else behind them did the same, which is why nothing happened there until yesterday.
So don't go.
What terrorist attacks?
Which country is that?
/u/WeirdPineapple ate it.
Because they were denied same basic human rights as straight people enjoyed.
Doesn't care like it affects you not at all, or doesn't care as in you think it shouldn't have been legalized?Because the first one I understand, I'm not sure I would care as much if this wasn't going to make people I love so much happier. Otherwise I think I'd just shrug and click over to another news article.
Getting married doesn't require a church.
dammit. oh well. I guess it's time to stop trying. Pack it up guys. we're done.

I remember the same thing happened when things like Obamacare were first being talked about, complaining about how America's going communist and threatening to move to Canada which already has free healthcare and everything.
Thank you!
Your upvote comment was "DESTROY THEM WITH LASERS".This is appropriate.
Yeah exactly. Maybe I'm not a news person, but it was just sudden for me
> that the supreme court has essentially robbed states of their democratic process The 14th Amendment was passed Democratically a long time ago.  The judges were appointed by a democratically elected leader.  This ruling states that the Constitution gives these rights to everyone equally.It was entirely democratic.
I love that the upquote for this comment is "if you want to capture someone's attention, whisper." 
Totally, I'm not gay, but you are still an inspiration to me. Always happy seeing you share your life's ups and downs, stay awesome.  
I feel the same way about Australia!! Surely this has to have bigger effects than just the U.S... I can't wait!
I am actually seeing a lot more love than expected, and I actually have new found friends from getting support on my post. I still have gotten a lot of flak from it, my friend's list count dropped a bit and I have been publicly called out a few times, along with some people who have genuinely hurt me with their reactions. No regrets though, it was invigorating finally standing up for what I believe in. 
Well, technically the 14th amendment wasn't relative to gay marriage until two years ago.  Sexual orientation was never considered a protected class until a Supreme Court ruling in 2013.
You get the maple syrup.
Is that so surprising? We're not some backwards little theocracy here you know.
That makes no sense - he was the one that knew how to fix stuff. Mama always said "If you aren't handsome, you better be handy."
Marriage comes with a ton of legal benefits, such as the right to visit your partner in the hospital on their deathbed. The right to be a legal guardian to your partners child. It is not a religious construct and hasnt been for centuries. 
I have no idea how to react to this.
China. It's quarterfinals so I'm hoping it isn't our last game.
I'll have a medium gay Sprite please, no ice.
I dunno man. It's pretty hard when my mom is screaming at me and my dad about how I'm supposed to. Damn. I wish I could be like my mom some day anyways. What a great christian.
Hehe. At the same mass, he said that the Muslim god hates everyone that isn't Muslim. Gee, sounds a bit like him...
Serbia.We've got a long way to go when it comes to gay rights, but I'm happy to see that a lot of young people have progressive opinions.I'm bisexual and I go to a fairly liberal college. I'm out to most people I know my age, and I've *never* had a truly bad reaction to coming out. I feel pretty great about that.
Thanks. I suppose you got the reference?
The first one. And really I just don't care at all so I can't be happy for anybody.
Then there isn't only one definition of the term "Marriage".
Not saying that, but it will take a lot of time.  A few things that turn me off from the crusade is the pride parades, for or against mentality, and all the fucking stickers.  I guess I just believe that life is what it is, and yelling about something like equal marriage is a waste of effort that could be directed towards more important issues.
The post title? How does one letter determine an entire thread's worth of upquotes?Or perhaps you mean the first letter of the comment. Still, the two parent comments of yours begin with the same letter and lead to different quotes (for me).
For sure. 
Shut up, Chandler.
One of the best pieces of writing coming from the supreme court I have ever read.

That lack of space in "Trekkie.Polyglot" in your flair bothers me a little bit.
I think we do.
Also because it's pretty nice to be able to know what a potential romantic/sexual interest's sexual preferences are.
which, as a Canadian, always makes me laugh because *gay marriage has been legal in Canada for years*.
Conservatism isn't a bad thing in itself. On a political level, it is intended to describe people who think you should take more time in passing laws, and should be careful with government spending. It's a pretty simple concept and not nefarious in any way. It's about being slow and methodical and those are good things. It's the polarization that gives us ignorant conservatives and bleeding heart liberals, and we'd probably make a lot more progress if we stopped letting the media pit us all against each other :(All this from my perspective, of course
That's okay I know how it feels. My family said that supporting gay people was the same as being gay, and was sinful. As you can imagine, they do not know I'm bisexual. It doesn't bother me anymore though. People can live in the past if they really want to, the future is still going to come. 
Dude, I got the same one!
It's a lot easier to fight for the right of marriage now that the Supreme Court has ruled it a matter of constitutional law. If a state tries to deny a couple their right, that couple fights them on the federal level, and the federal government wins.Marijuana is a whole different ball game, because the federal level, the trump card, is being played against you, rather than in your favor.
It's been pretty much the biggest news story of the last six months. Unless you've been on another planet this whole time, you really have no good excuse for being unaware of this.Even more embarrassing, though, is that you seen to have no clue how your own government works. I'm torn between trying to convince you to educate yourself and trying to convince you to never go near a voting booth. Which is to say, I'm not sure if democracy would be helped or hindered by your participation. If you think that court decisions are things we vote on, probably the latter.
Thanks I will! It's good to know I inspire 
A privilege every Canadian same-sex couple is entitled to!
The Mexican above me is speaking in caricatures and I did the same. I was raised in the Catholic Church and was told I was a sinner. This country has so many different and popular religions and we can't agree on anything and yet a country I was raised to believe was the holy motherland, Catholics are Catholics and that the US is somehow full of Cafeteria Catholics. Just the irony of it in my mind.
Not a chance. Too many people. There is a lot of outcry down here in the South, specifically Louisiana and Alabama, but if it weren't for Federal interference, Alabama would still be racially segregated. 
But isn't there already a type of contract which can be signed that pretty much gives you the same benefits? at least in Europe most countries have this.
Circlejerks aren't protected by the constitution ;-;
I hope Morgan can pick up where Rapinoe's head left off. 
In a rainbow can or a rainbow bottle?
Yeah, I read that book over and over again. 
Yeah, that's understandable.For some people this is a huge thing, for some its more like "okay, about time." and for some it doesn't mean anything at all, just another day.And all of these (in my own small opinion) are totally fine. Its the ones squalling about how its going to threaten their marriage (how?) that need to sit down and stop whining. I think not caring is fine, everyone cares about something this just isn't what you care about.
I'm sorry but I don't understand how you're relating the gun argument to the issue of same-sex marriage.
Yes, same goes for parent comments. Quotes tend to stay the same throughout a whole comment thread with the quote corresponding to the parent comment.
Revolutionary But Gangsta
I never got into CMYK. Always been a RGBA guy.Why does CMYK exist?
I will fix it when I get pc
When I saw the "I'm moving to Canada 'threats'" all I could think was "ya' know it is legal there, right?" and "oh, ya' know how you hate paying taxes...umm..."  Canada is going to send you back COD, covered in maple syrup and poutine, with a puck in your craw.  ;)
What? We don't need to "fight for" marriage. We just *won*. That fight is now over, for good.
No excuse. Lol. I gave my opinion on the issue. You're taking casual conversation into a different area. 
Ah, gotcha. Apologies for being a bit touchy there - in the days following our marriage equality vote last month, I heard a lot of Americans reacting like Ireland was fucking Iran or something. A "Wow, even those superstitious drunkards like the gays" kind of vibe, you know? To be fair, Ireland has come a long way in a very short space of time. When I was born in the early 80s condoms, divorce, and the simple act of even being gay were against the law here. Anyway, sorry again for my last comment, and I think we can both agree today is a great day for humans everywhere. 
If you're into tropical climates, you'll love my place. Also, I cook ;)
It depends on the state. 
She managed just fine.
No problemo! Bitchy Barbie dolls truly change lives
It wasn't me!
I am watching the TV show.
> ...grow up with the assumption that same-sex marriage being legal is normal and good...  It relates to the idea that marriage is bad, or could be bad, or is inherently bad.  A thing is neither good nor bad, but it depends on how it is used that makes it good or bad.
I'm pretty lost. What are you guys talking about? ELI5?
Before ten hours ago, half of the population
It's the one true colour model, you heathen.
I want to flee to Canada if THAT'S the outcome! I fucking love poutine.
You must not live in the south. States are already discussing not giving out marriage licenses in general to prevent gay people from getting married. It's not over yet.
Your opinion is ignorant and uninformed, and you should be embarrassed.
During the summer, yes.During the winter, abso-fucking-lutely not
You're in Mexico?  I found a giant hermit crab there once xD
I take it that you don't subscribe to Plato's idea of an absolute truth?
Red Green Blue Alpha, where Alpha means transparency.
I can't even remember what the reason was -- something to do with paperwork, maybe -- but years ago I was on the way to the Maritimes from New England, and my mother expressed some concern that I might get 'stuck' in Canada. (Not too much concern, mind you.) I said, "Yeah, that would suck, huh? Wow, what would I do if I couldn't leave Canada right away?"
Sounds like you've had rough experiences pushing your own views on others. 
XD our crabs do tend to be huge.
I don't know because I have no idea what that is.  I don't particularly enjoy philosophy in a formal setting.
Our are always so tiny!
Awesome! I'll have to watch it. 
Where are you from?
The East Coast (America) :)
Definitely gonna keep it up now that I have momentum.Now that I think about it, it's ironic that I've picked up metaphorical momentum now that I've lost physical momentum
Planning on it :) and thank you.
Thanks!5'4" or 1.62m depending on what you prefer. According to BMI, <107lbs is underweight, >145 is over, and >175 is obese
I was the opposite end of the husky scale lol. Short and fat. And I had a decent growth spurt at the beginning of puberty and was taller than others for a few months before everybody else skyrocketed, which helped fill me out to proper size but it didn't last.I've never talked to anybody about the husky thing but it is awful. Let's take a word with negative connotations and apply it to kids at their most insecure time.Adults get referred to as "big and tall," I think that would be a better term to use for kids as well.
Thank you :) Very proud.
That's part of the reason I was able to remain motivated this time, I think. I just turned 20 and I figured if I don't lose it now I never will.
Will keep it in mind. Once I feel I've lost all the weight I need to, I'll post before-and-afters
Forgot about that sub! will x-post tomorrow
Things have been going pretty ok lately!Hopefully I keep working hard and pushing myself.
Thank you! I was thinking /r/keto, then figured maybe a humblebrag might belong better here. Will x-post to loseit tomorrow
Thank you, it means a lot to me :)
Have been to /r/ketocirclejerk, it's a riot. /r/congratslikeimfive is full of cool people too.
"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is today."I also procrastinated for 3 years and I finally happened to latch back onto proper diet and exercise. The hardest part is starting up imo
Thanks dude. I used to do judo and I know what you mean. I was the youngest one by 3 years and I was at a >20lb. deficit to whoever I partnered with.Just remember, you're at a disadvantage inside martial arts but one of the beauties of martial arts is that short people can learn to use their height to their advantage. So if you get into a legit fight you have a huge advantage.
Thank you :)
Thank you! It was easier than you might think tbh. Although I've noticed that the more fat I lose, the less fat I have left to lose. So the first 30 were way easier than the latest 10.
Of course :)Like I said, I'm still chubby. There's clearly room for improvement, and hopefully I can do so before summer
Thanks! My first priority was looking better. But my health is way more important to me now.
Thank you!
Congrats to you too! It's a bit of a sore spot for me not having grown much taller since middle school. But then you get to brag about things like this and also in low places you get to watch taller people bump their heads on shit while you glide through :)
My ultimate goal from the beginning was to look and feel better. Clothes are certainly on the agenda, but I'm gonna wait until I hit my lowest to do more shopping :)
Thank you from some random hipster in NJ!Restating what I said somewhere else in here: "The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is today."To me, it's more admirable to get back into shape at age 40 than at age 20. Keep fighting the good fight :)
Thank you!
No, you :)
Thanks! Not as much work as you'd think. The trick for me was to just get started, the rest came relatively easy.
Glad to hear that I might be of some help to you! I'm hoping to make this one of my most successful years after how stagnant all of 2016 was for me. Good luck to you!
Whatever floats your goat!
My man! Congrats to you too. Depressed and binge eating is pretty much a summary of me at my max weight lol.One of the things that keeps me going: is that junk food, or stopping early during a workout, really as enjoyable as looking and feeling good as a result of staying strong? The answer is almost always no.
Gaining a few pounds back isn't enough to change the fact that you've done great things! congrats to you too!
I know a lot of people use the thyroid as an excuse to never lose weight. But you're basically doing what I'm doing on hard mode. That's way cooler than what I've done! I'm proud that you've seen at least some results, keep it up :)
Thanks! I have unlimited meals in the caf, so I can always find at least something decent to eat.
Essentially. I probably could have worded it better. But I still have a while to go before I have good health, right now I'm just making healthier decisions trying to get there.
Congrats dude! Hopefully by the time you're 20 you've caught up to me! If you ever need someone to brag to you can always pm me :)
Baby steps are better than no steps! Keep it up!Is your flair a reference to AM btw?
Thanks and congrats to you too! My first round of weight loss was 4 years ago so I've had to buy new clothes. I went from between a L and XL to a flat M. Hoping to get to S by the time I'm done. I'd recommend keeping one of your largest t-shirts around (if you still have any) to wear when you're feeling down.In terms of pants, I believe I've gone from a 40" waist to ~32. It's bittersweet when your favorite clothes are falling off all the time :)
This is such tripe. Total nonsense.Unless you are a world-class bodybuilder, BMI is simply a ratio of weight to height, and the overwhelming majority of people will be at their healthiest within the (very wide and generous) range of a healthy bmi 
/r/ShittyLifeProTips
Sorry!Or not sorry, if you're ok with it
Put that on /r/showerthoughts haha.
Which sport?
Congratulations! I'm a fellow short person, I feel like it's a lot easier for us to get unhealthy since you can put on more pounds relative to size. I'm still a couch potato but I hope I can be where you are. 
Well now you know one lol. Although I'm not that short I'm more in the below average category lol. Maybe that's why I'm unsuccessful.
I look forward to seeing your progress!
Ironically I'm not short I am 1.88 6 foot 2 ahha 
Lol. Yep.   I'd heard it too and after a few years seeing the same doctor and not losing much weight, even after changing my diet and increasing the exercise, she had me do a blood test.   It was way off!! So I've been taking it for about a month now and have seen results.   
Wow, that's amazing progress! Mine is nowhere near as impressive as your weight loss, haha. I went from a L to a M/S, from a 36" to 32". I don't think I'll get any thinner than this - my bone structure dictates otherwise - and so I'm trying to get a little more fit now.Diet and weight loss makes you look good with clothes on, fitness makes you look good with clothes off (or so I hear!).
Yeah man, whatever works for you, thank you for the good luck wishes, and good luck to you should you begin lifting!
I could see that happening pretty easily though. Hopefully I can keep up the hard work forever
Didn't think of that! will do lol
I play soccer. Nothing too serious, just joined the local rec team and it's a ton of fun!
Idk if my height had to do with it but for me it was years of junk food and overeating.If it's hard for you to start working out or dieting like it was for me, just try baby steps. One of the most helpful things I heard when I started was "if you're dying after a 100 meter run just remember you're still beating your past self."
Give yourself time. :) Nobody starts out a complete success, as long as you're consistently working towards your goals you'll make progress. :) 
I look forward to having it!
8 years, which is pretty much the standard for most kids in my dojo. Adults can get through with 4-6 years if they put in the time and effort.
Don't listen to 'em, *I* believe in you! Practice a healthy lifestyle long enough and it just becomes the norm.
Your thread has blown up a bit wow. Nice!
Good for you! Nothing too serious, but better than I've ever done.I enjoy hiking, running, and biking but I've never actually played any team sports outside of gym class.
100 meters? I can barely do 10 meters. But that is motivational, thank you. 
Yeah, but I'm female so I have no natural muscle mass like guys and am consequently just "fat". Not overweight but my lbs of fat > muscle. 
I would love to know the trick to that!
Haha time is something I don't have.
Like they say, once a black belt, always a black belt. I definitely wouldn't be the person I am today without it. 
That's the plan :)
Didn't quite expect it! but cool nonetheless
I'm sure there's somewhere you can find that'll let you join even with 15 years of not practicing.
Brodin guide you
To losing weight?
Hahaha! My comment blew up a bit from it too but yes, nice one on the weight loss!
To be honest high schoolers would probably slay me. Are the teams you join public or are they just school teams?
To go from a higher healthy weight to a lower healthy weight. There's just less motivation because you're not actually in the red, I guess. 
Completely public. Around half of my team goes to my (3500 student) school, and the other half goes to other schools.
That's true if you're 20 or 80. Your past is past. All you have left to worry about is your future, however much or however little there may be. You could be 20 and only live a week; you could be 80 and live another decade. So. What good for yourself and others will you do tomorrow? 
I get it. Life kinda pushed me out of the dojo too. At least you have your priorities straight
What's stopping you, if you don't mind me asking? 27 is nothing. I was at college with people in their 40's, and back in uni days one of the mature students was in his 60's easily.It's never too late to go back :)
I might just do that - but only for my fellow redditors.  There's only a few of you, right?
Or they could be dead, like your wife.
I got my nursing degree at the age of 30. Great career! Both of you will do great!
Damn, right! Thanks for wanting to serve, good luck to you too! 
It's demanding, long hours, and nurses practically run the hospitals as the physicians never seem to be around.
It depends on where you live. The average annual salary for RNs in the US is $71,000.
Thanks - this might just aid me in my next quest, finding the right fella post-divorce ;)
One of my classmates at uni was in her 50's and had kids my age going to college. It was definitely harder for her because she had the family/job/keep shit together problem, but she seemed to be doing well for herself. I enjoyed having classes with her and the other nontraditional students because they were so disciplined. As a disciplined young adult it was nice to have people like me around.
Yea, I've certainly thought about it. I've got a BFA in art and would want to go back to get a teaching degree. Might do it within the next few years. I'm getting married this June so my funds are a little tied up at the moment lol My plan (eventually) is to go into the Junior College near my home and sit down with someone to explore my options. 
UhhYeahYeah just a handfull
Thanks!  :D
That's pretty good. I live in Australia.
I am in Southern Ontario! 
where do I send my application???
I was recently married too. I know the feeling! When you are ready to go to school, make sure to contact their financial aid department to see if there is any way to secure some free money - scholarships, bursaries etc. We have a lot of people that don't take advantage of them and have literally $1,000s left over. I can't say the same for whatever school you're interested in, but it can't hurt to find out.
There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
Thanks for the tip. I'll be sure to keep that in mind! 
Asking about scholarships and bursaries? I'm not sure if it would be different in other countries or even provinces/states, but at my college we have a list of scholarships and bursaries listed on our website under our financial aid section. For students that are interested and want more detailed information, they would either drop-in or make an appointment with a Financial Aid representative to discuss them further. You would want to do this process before your schooling starts as there are typically deadlines for the application that can be months before the semester begins. 
Same here. Even if they are disagreeing with me so long as they aren't flat out insulting.
Redditor for 9 years.. You earned my respect sir!
It's a weird habit, but I use it as a way to keep track of what I saw and read on reddit. I rarely ever downvote anyway.
Yep, these are the only exceptions.
Yes I agree. It should at least be connected to the post or comment.
I agree. As long as it's not an insult, bad trolling or something completely unrelated.
Oh, my friend is just like this. Now matter if Facebook, Instagram or whatever. And when it comes to answering messages.....However, I criticized him a few times, and now he's already getting way better.
Old School ;)
Lol me too 
Hell yeah, I am the Reddit Karma Social Welfare departement!
One of my biggest pet peeves here. 
Oh, I just found it and tried to upvote it ;))But it seems to be archived.
Lol, at least try to make it connected to the subject of the post and you'll get upvotes :PBut don't forget to upvote my posts too!
No it doesn't look like you're getting an upvote. You ARE getting an upvote.
It's so great, I hope you have an equally great weekend!
What is CC?
Test succesfully completed!
Yes, I had posts like these too. However, I tried too.
Lol so true 
Upvoteeee! ;)
Yep, Unless it's an exception.
Same! Especially when I don't really have anything to say in reply, I think I got into the habit on facebook and twitter and now I just do it here too. 
Yes it definetely reveals your appreciation.
Fresh Delivery: +1
Test succesfully completed.
I would upvote "this"But not the other two. As long as it's somehow connected to the post or is no insult.
+1No way out of my upvotes.
Apparently not. Just look at a few subs all over reddit. Maybe at CC
Yes! Something I was thinking of too, but forgot to mention!
Sorry for you :(Something like this drives me mad.
I know. I regret it.
Oh a few upvotes every hour. Nothing that bad :P
Free upvotes for evvvvveryonee!
Up up up +1
Interacting is obviously the most important. Way more than simple upvote.
Just have a look at a few Subs. Maybe on CC... unfortunately not everywhere
I agree. It really has to be something I really really dislike with all my heart.
Hello hello,+1:)))
These kind of people are by far the worst..
Hoobastank
Gold in my language means "downvote". You still want Gold?
Of course it is ;)
Of course! 3 comments left lol+1
I know what you mean! I always upvote the parent comment or a question too, because without it a conversation would not even have started..
Plz no probz+1
It depends a lot. If the opinion is expressed in an acceptable manner, I might upvote it. If it's something I don't agree with, I just ignore it. And if it's a comment I REALLY despise the last solution would be downvote.
You're a legend!
Thanks a lot man - I appreciate that!
Thanks, +1
All you have to do is be civil and I'll like you. In fact, having a civil discussion with those who disagree with me can be a really pleasant and even memorable experience. 
Then we will probably have a long conversation.
I'll hit ten years next month. :) 
Old school cool.
Exactly! That's another benefit from it. I realise this on posts that come out BIG.
certainly the case for me too
I feels ya, I will practice some more. 
Yes. Why do you do this? Just curious :)
Honestly, if I have a post that isn't in r/CC or r/wholesomememes in the last 24 hours and I see it it worries me, like "what did I mess up this time?" Around here everyone is just friendlier!
Haha yeah it's an oldie. I was pretty surprised it got so popular, I guess people are attracted to threads titled "I upvote almost everything" haha
Haha sweet, I thought you were gonna burn me for a second
Casual Conversation!
Never change, reddit.
I don't think I have ever had a post have so many replies it overwhelmed me, but CC replies are the best replies.
Results received. 
>I would upvote "this"I wouldn't, in that it doesn't contribute to the discussion. So why would you?
What if I got super unnecessarily mean?
I see that you have used "posts" correctly in other comments in this thread, so it was obviously just a typo...My bad for pointing it out.  It just seems like people are suddenly having a difficult time pluralizing certain words. Enjoy your afternoon. 
What about silver?
<3If we just replied to each other all night and upvoted each other you think anyone would notice?
I'm just a regular guy, trying to do my bit of good deeds in this somewhat negativity filled world.
Absolutely. I would never learn anything if I only listened to people who agree with me. 
/r/ForeverAlone 
Thank you.
Wow I always wanted to meet a veteran. How many meme wars did you survive?
Never saw it. Does this make me a bad person? 
Plus, another benefit of using RES is it keeps track of your upvotes. So if I ever see another user with a green +1 next to their name, I immediately think I must've already read/liked something s/he said before! It's always a nice surprise.
I just upvote while I read, that's at least two seconds my mouse hand/thumb isn't doing anything anyway. If I feel it isn't meaningful after I read it I unupvote or downvote if it is rude. SPREAD THE KARMA!
I already anwered it in my post.However, for me it just shows appreciation for taking time and means "Thank you for interacting with me!" in my eyes :)
9 months ago  you must have felt the same way like me at the moment. I never imagined it would get so many upvotes ;)
Never would I ever not upvote these honorable redditors that answer to my posts!
Oh. Darn it.
Feels bad man :/
I can totally approve this!
"This" means to me: "Wow, this is what I always wanted to say/ what I always thought! I'm kinda speechless" That's my definition
There's always a reason for being mean.If you have depressions or any suicidal thoughts, please feel free to contact the suicidepreventionlifeline.org !I hope I could help!+1
No probs dude.Thanks you too.But: *night
Shhh and take your +1 :P
Yes, I would honey.<3
I do the same. I just did an ask reddit about this. We need to upvote those with contrary opinions to us or else the comment tree will not show up. If we upvote those we disagree with, the whole thing will be more likely to be read, and replied to.
You're welcome kind stranger. :) And thanks for taking your time to write this comment. 
Lol. I actually wasn't particularly active in the community aspect for a long time. Just as a source for information. So I missed out on most of it.
No, but it is a good movie. Watch it with the wife. 
> green +1I've got people in dark green, +200s on here. :)  
To me this is how I pay respect to the other individual. Small and symbolical gesture. Where are you from?
Haha yeah but now I have a few posts that scored higher :p free updoots!
Haha wasn't expecting that, thanks brah I think I'll be good +1
Maybe where you are, but here, it is just after 2PM. Afternoon.
T_D's mammoth sized leak makes me way less willing unfortunately. They ruin so many threads 
Alright. Yes just like me. But you know, here and there I visit some funny subs. A few memes never hurt nobody.
>Some days I feels like I've been on the website forever. Tell me about it!   
I will keep that in mind.  But we are making our way through Harry Potter first! 
Nice :) I'm surprised you're only at +3 for me. I see you everywhere.
Just keep upvoting :)
Austria!Where are you from?
Yep I also have other posts with even more upvotes :)
Yep, that's what it was supposed to mean :)
It's a shame, really. T_D started out as trolls that were actually making fun of the fact Chetto Tinyhands was even running. Now it's just bots and shitposting for easy karma. 
I'm pretty out of touch with memes, but I love critter pictures and learning.
Holy, 11 years over here! And very little karma. Is this an alt or you're just more into lurking? I've only started contributing comment-wise over the past couple months, myself. 
That's a long journey. I saw the first couple, then got bored.
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. :) I'm by far the most active on this sub, because I love the community. 
Oh, that surely does make sense.
A little south-east from you - Bulgaria :) 
It is rather wild how it 180'd. I'm curious how many of the current mods either came after the flip or embraced it 
The further down you go, the less sustenance you receive 
Pepe Donald..
I use it mostly for the custom front-page but contribute occasionally.
That's a good thing! Whenever I see your posts, they are always so positive. Keep up the good work :)
Cool! You grew up in a rather rural area right? ;)
I cannot *believe* you associated our great nation's president with that white supremacist meme!  Mr. President would never support those people!Oh wait.
>Was a lurker for a long time before finally making an account.Hey man!Yeah i was a lurker for about 2 years.But interacting with the community is just way more joyful and I love it. I'm not a regular redditor. But from time to time i love to make a few post and comment on other posts. And I'm obviously fond of upvoting ;)Cheeeers
Actually I was born and grew up in the capital - Sofia. Though ?I live in the suburbs it is still an urban area. What made you think I had been living in the rural area? 
Awesome man. Have a great day!
Ah alright! No problem. I thought maybe both of us are "nicer" because we grew up in a rather rural area. I mean people in the countryside set great value upon saying "thank you" or greeting people I assume ;)btw.: Austrian Villages and the Austrian Countryside is different from the one in Bulgaria. You probably know better, but in documentations it often looked like the Bulgarian countryside was very poor :)
Bad askredditor, no lurking. Mandated chatting for all. 
I do too, also, I'm new (:
I don't even feel like swearing.
My kind of place!
Hello! How ya doing? :)
One of us!^One^Of^us!
That's only enough for two pancakes! 
Since this thread made it to /r/all too, I don't think there'll be a shortage of people to talk to!
Aww, thanks! You're such a elegant commenter! 
I'm glad you're enjoying your stay! :)
We love all!
Well you've come to the right place :)
Eeeveryone together now. <3 
Very top right hand corner. It's in the "casual conversation" banner.
Not much mate, you?
Where can I find a facehugger?
Shrek is love,shrek is life
I have two!Both Shih-tzu mixes. How about you?
Awww shucks
Hello there!
Really?Wow, nice! Always great to have some new people coming along :)
Going for a Saturday night drink. My favorite night of the week! Thanks for asking!
I'm sure your day will be full neat surprises, just like you are to me being in this sub! I hope you stay!
I really hope you stick around, Wazer! We could really use more awesome people like you! 
foggy right now. it was cloudy yesterday and will be overcast tomorrow. 
just post whatever you want! As long as it's not racist,sexist,etc.
Thanks!You too mate :)
how's it going?
:) Enjoy your stay!
I'm glad you're liking it!
Same here, I didn't even bother reading the other answers in the thread ! It seems all warm and peaceful here :D
*clears throat* FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING FUCK AND YOUR FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FUCKING AWESOME POSITIVITY!! There, better..?! 
I'll try. 
hahahahahahahahahaha
So do I! Also new
Hey, Drs_Anderson! I love your enthusiasm! 
**FUCK**^^^^^sorry
Unfortunately there does not seem to be poutine here...but other than that?
One of the reasons I really like you!
Your place is kind! 
One time a guy just went insane but a few hours after he came and made apologies.
I`m good :)how are you?
Thank you Guibmaster for your work! :)
Okay it's just you and me then!
Pancake batter on the hot griddle. Sprinkle chopped, crispy, bacon on top. Cook. Smother with butter and syrup. Die happy.Also good with grape or strawberry jam on top. Another variation is bacon *and* banana slices in the batter. 
Thanks! how long have you been here for?
I just got very very late today at work and got called for that... but despite that I'm good! :D
Nothing really, chilling with a beer and watching the Scotland football match. 
Ooh that's lovely!! I have one, she's a mix of a Yorkshire terrier and Maltese. How old are your dogs?
How are you? :) 
this sub reddit is everything i love about ask reddit minus the negative folks
Just woke up, too lazy to get out of bed and my bro is back from Uni for Thanksgiving weekend (Canada). Life is good :) 
*Much* better!
you're not /u/subvertedai!
It's ok...you've come to the right place.*gives /u/PkmnTrainerJpesky a hug*
I'm just going to join this train I think. Peer pressure wins!
It's ok no one cares that much that you swore.
while letting all the air out of everyone's tyres?
Can't complain!
sup nigga homie?
I wouldn't call it work XDI just made a comment.
I think it is a bit too staged, i really like it, but some things are a bit too much. 
I must try this soon. 
Probably since August I think :)
Ah, you're from the UK too? Whereabouts, if you don't mind me asking?
I think OP is a fairly cool guy.
Good and yourself?
:D there are some really wondeful people here.
Hello, fellow Northern Brother!
I'll still try to participate in conversations
I'm proud of you, son.
I want to say things too!
Hey, don't speak for me! I fucking care!
Montreal, represent!
I'm gonna like this sub.
What it is bruhh
Ok I got a color now too. Does it mean anything? Wait don't tell me I'm just going to inadvertently comment around giving some sort of an impression I don't know about
I actually like the staged parts. It always makes me laugh! Top Gear U.S., blah, lame.
Shetland Islands originally, but moved to Aberdeen a few years ago. What about yourself? 
awww shucks
I'm new too look at me!
Let's all say things.
oh so it's for secrets? cool!
I'm sorry. :(
I like you
How you feel how you feel?
I've been down in Cornwall for the past few years. It's nice down here, but no where near hilly enough.
Yes.. yes it was. 
Hello there!
I love lamp.
Where can I find a facehugger?
I think we all care here, I mean that's the idea right? :) This is one of the first subreddits I have actually wanted to comment in, I enjoy talking with people even about the most minute things.
And I like *you*.
I guess we might as well join in then.
I love weed.
I like you.
And I like me :)
Hey! Cool username
It's like in real life
I like me too ;)
Thanks! Yours is cool as well. 
Aw thanks :)Congrats on getting active! Yeah loads of people slack a bit at Christmas (me included), but you're right, it will be much easier to restart this time round. Good luck!
Lovely to hear! I am making a new 2016 thread later on so feel free to post your resolutions there.
Thanks very much, that's so nice to hear!
Wow you had a great year, good job!
I've got to say that's the first time I've been called a god damn big pimp, but I like it! 
Thank you so much for the kind words and the gold!Happy New Year friend :)
I am making a new 2016 thread later today, feel free to post them there!
Thanks! I didn't use a bot (wouldn't know how to!) but I copied and pasted the below text and just filled in each username, link URL and goal.-----/u/Exactly one year ago in the New Year Megathread, I asked you what's one thing you wanted to achieve by 31st Dec 2015. I said I would message you on the 31st to see if you completed it. Well, today's the day![Your goal was:]()**
Congrats! What type of novel is it?
I can see it becoming a bit of a tradition!
Why stop masterbating? Is there a specific reason?
Good job on staying out of hospital, I hope the fireworks aren't bad!I am making a new 2016 thread later today, feel free to post your new resolutions there!
Congrats on the weight loss, that's amazing!
At least you tried!Sounds like a great goal to me though, best of luck!
I will be checking in with you this time next year ;)Best wishes for 2016!
Congratulations, that's amazing to hear!
Hey! I like you.
Aww that's wonderful, congratulations!
Absolutely, you've come a long way and you should be very proud. Hopefully you'll be able to run next year!
Yay that's great to hear! Happy new years :D
That's brilliant progress, well done!You're welcome!
Congrats on the job! What is it you'd like to improve about your self image?My pleasure
Wow, it's awesome that you wrote another novel! Honestly, that just gives you more chances to get something out there that people might love! Great job :)
Glad to hear things are going well for you! Where did you travel? One of my favourite quotes is: *Life begins at the end of your comfort zone*.Happy to be of service :)
Congrats on your success, that's great to hear!You're welcome :)Here's to a healthy and happy New Year!
Well if you achieved part of your goals, then you achieved, regardless of how much. Good job!
Slightly better is better than stagnant! You're welcome, hope you either get your boss' job or get another great job in 2016. Best of luck!
That's great news, well done on getting the grades!Thank you, same to you :)
My floors thing was 'swole is goal' I think we all failed lol
Interesting flair
Big congrats to you! Good luck finishing your book, I've got no doubt you'll do it :)
Well he's not on reddit,so he's making the best of his time
He got the SO then
Damn, it's too bad hardly anyone read your comment. Good luck with your apartment though :)
dou natta ka oshiete kudasai*("Please let us know how it turned out / what happened")
But if he's using reddit less that's a goal completed.  
2016 is your year! Choose two or three goals instead to make it more manageable :)
Sure thing! I will remove your goal if you want?
Something a lot of successful people have in common is they didn't stop after their first project didn't take off. They'll start a new project. And that will fail. Then they'll start another, and another, and even though they all fail eventually one won't fail.
That's unfortunate about your knee, but hopefully you'll be able to complete it in 2016!
That's great to hear, congrats on achieving your goal!To 2016!
You're most welcome.It definitely sounds like you've come a long way from last year! And absolutely booking a trip to Tokyo is rather crazy, I would know as I went there myself a few months ago!! It is AMAZING, you'll have a blast.
That's wonderful to hear! My pleasure :)I had a fantastic year thanks, I went travelling for a bit and managed to tick quite a few things off my bucket list (travel solo, Tokyo, Kyoto, Bullet Train, Rome, Vatican City, see the Pope, Florence, Vienna) and I graduated with the highest mark on my degree course. Happy New Year
Well, let me put it in terms most are familiar with here:I appreciate the forward thinking and truly considerate fashion in which you took time out of your own busy life to inquire about other's and to go even further by revisiting these people and showing how you took a genuine interest in their lives - a year after the fact.That speaks volumes of the character you posses and regardless what your motivation was for doing it, I find it a net gain towards your character as an individual.How's that for code switching it up for ya? :P
Sock prices went trough the roof at his place.
Thanks you so much. I really need someone like you to hold me accountable (to some degree).See you in a year! Hopefully I'm a ~~golden god~~ healthier weight by then. :)
I had managed to lose about 25lbs early this year. Exercising 3-4 days a week, watching what I ate, eating smaller meals, etc, but due to some major stress ended up gaining it back and then some.Today I'm gonna splurge with my family, then tomorrow I'm back on the wagon.I'm kicking this things ass one way or another.
This sounds like it could become a tradition, then get really fucking depressing.  And I'm selling the screenplay!
username checks out...
Hello other numpad pattern username. 
The confidence is strong in this one
If I put all the people who like me in a room, you'd get pretty bored being alone after a while. Jks it's not that bad luckily. 
Thank you :)!
Seriously, try harder /u/VividLotus. Congrats!
She's in closed beta!
Thanks :)! And if you want to be really technical about it, in my original comment last year I never specified that I wanted to have 100% of a baby, or what species the baby had to be, so I feel like I can slide by on the technicality that I have a human baby who is about 76% done, and earlier this year we adopted a puppy, aka a dog baby.
Thankyou so much!
Yeah, do not share your bit on reddit. At all. Your sharing needs to happen at a club, not on here where something that could propel you into a different career path could be stolen at whim. Just two cents from someone who has walked that road :) 
If they eat 2lb of food they will weigh 170! Quick!
Yep, just gotta find someone who's compatible with you. I've found when I'm dating a very outgoing girl I tend to get jealous, and that I'm so much more compatible with a shy girl. Like anything else, it's all trial and error.
That was the best reply to the best comment. You said everything I was thinking as I read his comment :) You're right, first paragraph guy *is* awesome! What an adventure, there were ups and downs, laughter, tears, and the enlightenment at the end made it all seem really wholesome and worthwhile. /u/originalone !! Shake off those neg feelings and go kick ass at life some more! e: werds
What is a PPL? "Party Playa License"?
Will do, and Happy new years! 
Consider yourself added! See you in a year :)
Glad you're enjoying it!
Don't leave us hanging OP!
I think he meant he achieved 1 out of his 3 goals, no?
There's a line in a Girls episode where she is told to get outside her comfort zone because, "that's where the magic happens," and it's basically become a mantra for my wife and I. 
You too, have a good New Years. 
The funny thing is I don't even care about it anyomore.
I got a higher paying job with more hours so it was more achievable! How did your resolutions go?
What's an EP? Sorry for being out of the loop.
It's a she.
I'd prefer to believe he got the SO earlier this year, but she was actually crazy and they broke up after a month or so. She then went on to reddit stalk him and he had to jump ship for a new username. 
Will do. I know i can finish ASOIF, watch  more movies, and read more books. This is the year.
Yeah, I'd like that! :) I've been less careful with keeping my reddit nick secret from my friends over the last year so that's the reason 
Thanks! And thanks for all you do with the resolutions and such!
Awesome! Glad to hear it :)
> Lots of 7/11s.Interesting gauge :P
Forrest Gump?
*Don't Die*  The true story of /u/myprivatepornaccount  ^by ^/u/alex3omg 
You have a pattern that's easier to remember.
I have hope. I suppose I could have said "Could I PM you if I am accepted to UPENN and if I decide to go?" I know that it will be a total crapshoot. But I have hope that I am unique enough in my life to be accepted. Yes I am confident. But, is that bad?
I only had one, sorry. They're super hard to catch.
Huh. TIL I'm a human trafficker.
Uighur *please.*
Ikr I'm dying, and I needed this laugh!
You're totally welcome. Thanks for being cool about me using your ethnicity for karma!
I'm confused. What flair?
I like you! 
If I put all the people who didn't like me in that room, u/SKR47CH wouldn't be bored after all the whiles.
Wait, so you have a baby, you just can't hold it yet.  
Thanks :)!
As a nurse, I'm not quite sure how that goes. But hey, I've been known to be wrong before!
Best of luck on the release!
While I wouldn't steal it for profit, I'd totally do the jokes at social functions.
That's just over one litre of water, that's easy!
I confessed my feelings to a girl I liked in October, and it couldn't have gone better. It turns out we're really compatible. My track record with girls is terrible (one divorce, one physical and emotionally abusive) so this is big step in the right direction.I'm sure you'll meet someone. You sound awesome
Considering he mentioned /r/flying... Definitely.
Add me! * a simple flat belly. I cant achieve abs so a flat belly would do! * visit Japan* learn japanese, cantonese or german
146 wpm is my record, about 130+ average. Addictive game!
thats probably coz you suck at letter q I know because also did I. also y and  x and c.
Sounds like a great year for you!Mine went very well thank you, I went travelling and ticked quite a few things off my bucket list (travel solo, Tokyo, bullet train, Kyoto, Rome, Vatican City, see the Pope, Florence, Vienna) and I graduated with the highest marks on my degree course. Here's to 2016!
Extended Play. It's a short album. 
And one of her last posts is about a SO
Sounds like he needs to lawyer up
It certainly is! Best of luck.
I promise I will never die... 
You should put them both in a box and make them fight like mantises
Damn shame hahahah
People in the breakroom are staring at me..I am laughing so hard right now..:)
My resolve is getting Uighur and Uighur 
Ayy no worries, every time I hear about Uighurs it's usually some knife fighting in Western China, it's nice to have some jokes for a change!
"Have an Ulighur"
Ah, very true! Or I guess to be even more specific, I have approximately 76% of a baby.
Trust me. You can impress people with this knowledge!
Untill it's time to pee...
I choose to believe the Party Playa License.
Good luck if you go with japanese or cantonese. Im half japanese with a mother who immigrated here when she was 25, all i really know is bare bones basic phrases and the general gist of japanese coversation. As someone with english as a first language, japanese is probably one of the most difficult to learn
Early Happy Birthday!
Wtf you're like the resolutions wizard
The slotted spoon doesn't hold much soup. 
Hey man, the one Uighur per comment law is intended to help preserve their population for the future.  You don't want Mick Jagger to have to explain to your great-grand children what a majestic Uighur once was using only drawings and crude hand gestures, do you?
Uhh.. Yeah. Niiice.No takesies backsies.
He often goes on about food and said European food sucked.  He said kebabs and Turkish food was good but for whatever reason he's never really said where he's from.  He speaks something that doesn't quite sound like Arabic.  He's definitely Muslim and has family all over the world.  I think he's one of these upvote people.  
Too bad I just finished my maternity rotation. Would have been a good question to ask labouring moms
You just need a big bowl of very salty soup followed by that liter of water. The salt will make you retain water and the weight will stay on for a couple days. 
We'll he cant be following up on everyone else resolutions if he didn't complete his own. Just gotta take it one step at a time. 
The slotted spoon can catch the potato!
Uh guys uighurs are an ethnic minority in chinaAnyways happy new year everyone
Yes he almost certainly is. To confirm, you should buy and give him a special Uighur hat and see if he recognizes it when you give it to him. Lol. They are kinda squarish shaped small hats. Google "Uighur hat" and you'll see it.  
Why not just drink the water salty? I guess it's for weaklings who don't like the taste of salt...
Exactly!*she, btw :)
I regret nothing.  Happy new year to you too.
DRINK YOUR BRINE MAN ANIMAL

Merry xmas!
We have the best mods!
 As you wish.Pretty relevant upvote message.
lol u silly
me too! :)
That one's my favorite. :D  I also like up top... "Stuck in header factory, send help."  I almost never use sub styles, but I'm leaving this one on.
Tiz the season *
Thanks! I doubt myself a ton though. Loving this update 
It sure is! I upvote a lot, especially in the conversations I'm having - but this makes me want to upvote even more - for the upquotes!
Aww buddy, would that we could control mobile reddits too! Then we mods would be *true* rulers.
Right?! I generally upvote everyone in the conversation I'm in, this is a nice bonus incentive to spread the love though! :)
thats why i put ayy imao

THat's a nice boulder.
I got "This is Sparta" almost right away.Merry Christmas!
Preach it.
Thanks lol
This time it called you B-E-A-U-tiful 
*tits the season
You shouldn't, because "You're super cool!"
B-E-A-utiful!
you got an "over 9000" from me - merry xmas holmes :)
I'll take credit :) bc I've been adding a few new things to the CSS. 
Because you knew what the upvote on yoir comment would say?
You are so kind
What are these words?
You are super cool!
You got a CJA > GoA from me lol. Poor /u/GodOfAtheism...
You are so kind!
if you take away the upvote then upvote again the message pops up again
&#3232;_&#3232;
Upvoting rocks!
Windows emoticons ;)
Wow, didn't realize that was in there. Thanks.
It's okay, shes just jelly because I mod high quality discussion subs like /r/circlejerk and all she mods are terrible maymay based subreddits like /r/casualconversation
Nice upvote.
They're not Windows. It's a standard that Windows, iOS and Android (among others) implement.
Will do! :)
Who's GoA? God of Atheism?
nah, thank you for the idea
I like your flair.
I was not the mod who actually wrote in any of the comments, so I'm not responsible! ;) Perhaps /u/tizorres can change that for us?
Hey now, she also mods /r/magicskyfairy where they do science stuff on a daily basis.
WOOMP THERE IT IS!!
Oh, weird it doesn't show up for /u/TruthfulDeception then, and I assumed it was a Windows thing, because I only see them on my Windows Phone and laptop (windows 8) I used my brothers macbook once and it didn't show them :O
I tits you, duh
Change what? 
You are so kindNice upvote
I have a mac, tho
One of the upquotes is spelled in correctly - "You're genius is showing!" should be "Your genius is showing!"
Ah cool. I fixed it. 
I hope your cat comes back :( waiting and hoping for him to walk back through your door must be terrible. Good feels your way :)
See, now I feel a bit bad.  My dog was found on the street and no one came to claim her at the pound after several weeks, so we got first pick for adopting her.  What if her family still misses her and wants her back?Then again she was found without a collar and is a breed of dog that tends to be abandoned according to Wikipedia.
He's been very hesitant around the other cats and there has been some hissing so I don't believe they do which is sad. I think he does? He certainly recognised my Dad, none of the cats really like my Dad as he's loud and Benjie wouldn't go near him, and to me that says he recognises us? I can't get enough cuddles he must be sick of me! 
Yes he's microchipped! I'm amazed it even worked! It's so weird having him back home. I think it shows that getting your pet chipped could end in a happy reuniting
Had to go away for a bit. She was a changed cat after her near death experience, had to leave and be alone to sort through all her thoughts and ruminate on what it means to be alive.
Yes he's microchipped, it's so worth getting done. We asked around and the carpet fitter had rang the neighbour whose house he was working at as a cat had bolted out the back of his van but we only found this out by asking around. My Mum thought that they had either found Benjie dead or he was alive as its not the vets we normally go to. But it turns out he's alive! She was given the details of the lady who had been feeding him and we went up to go see her and thank her. She was a little upset to see him go as he's a lovely cat but we're going to send her some flowers and a photo of him 
What a heartwarming message, /u/LICK-A-DICK
Sadly I got rid of any litter he used before, but that would have been a great idea. I've been out every night shaking treats and calling his name, I've attracted all sorts of other cats except him..I have hung up posters of him but no one has called about it. If you know any other tips please let me know! I miss him so deeply. He's been an indoor cat most of his life, he adjusted the outdoors really well but it rained one night when he went outside and I had unfamiliar family over and I think he lost sent of home, that's my guess at least.. 
No hes not chipped, I asked about chipping him once we find him but I was told it's only got for identifying them at shelters and not actually tracking where they are..  I've told many neighbours to check their garages, friendly neighbours from a few blocks away are doing the same thing, and I said in a previous comment, theirs a very nice older woman who leaves her garage door open a crack and puts cat food out for strays. I'm hoping he goes there and I just keep missing him because he's always on the move..
That's so sweet, I can imagine how happy you must have been seeing them again :')This is what I'm hoping. I leave the back door light on every night for him, I hope one day I wake up and he's sitting outside waiting for me to let him in. I will be so over the top happy to see my little guy again it'll be the best day of my life. 
I have a feeling raccoons or other animals/cats will get to it first 
Look at it this way, you've just taken a lost dog home so even if he is technically still owned by someone else you're still doing the right thing by taking him in and giving him a home. You are his new family and I bet he's happy with you. 
We consider him a miracle.  The thing that pains me most is how close he was and how lonely he must have been.  There is a window in the house he was trapped in that looks straight towards ours.  I wonder if he sat looking through it.  He is such a people cat, it must have been hell.  Thanks for your kind words.
I probably wouldn't stop cuddling him for a week. Honestly though really happy for you guys. Hope they get along better. 
There are many animals that live longer outside of captivity. I don't think cats are usually one of them, but this cat has a lot of free land to wander, and there aren't any other cats nearby except her son (and they're always together). We also put out some amount of food every week or two so she can stay well fed (not so much she'll stop hunting, though). She was also technically an indoor cat for the first few months of her life until she got big enough to stay outside, so she might have some shots, but I can't really remember. Regardless she hasn't been inside a house for two decades.
Oh, I see --so she looked after him for the last six years, took him to the vet and discovered he was chipped? Had she taken him in, or just fed him as a stray?
You're welcome. Thank you for taking the time to read it! 
Someone in the neighborhood may have also taken him in. I hope you find him. I've experienced something similar and it's a horrible feeling being separated from a pet so abruptly. 
I mean cats spend a lot of time letting you know they don't need you :p
Yes, very happy and lazy and adorable. :3
A Maltese.  It's a small, white, yappy lapdog breed.
My app thinks the comma is part of the URL, that may be your problem
I never knew cat hierarchy was a thing. I always presumed the cats got on or didn't. How does it work with cats?
I'd never seen that sub before but now that I've checked it out I can see why you'd suggest it. Just based on the name it sounded like you were taking a jab at OP.
A lot of people have been saying that and I'm starting to think that, I would rather someone be taking care of him then he's hurt or stuck somewhere hungry :( And if that is the situation I hope they give him back to me! He's very affectionate and unique, a lot of people love him..
My first dog was a Maltese, crazy to think it's a common breed to abandon because I loved the crap out of her
That was the problem! Thanks!
Cats are a pack animal just like lions. It takes some time figuring out where they belong in the "pride". Sometimes they get along, sometimes they don't, but there's always a pecking order. 
Yeah, I keep forgetting how it sounds. This isn't the first time this happened to me. I should put up more information next time. lol
Like the other person said, it might be worth going around and asking your neighbors. When our cat went missing, it turned out a guy on the other street had taken him in. Our cat is mean, however, so he ended up bringing him to a shelter haha
I've left my name and number at all the shelters around my area, and I've told my neighbours to. I've talked to some people a couple blocks away from me and gave them some posters of him. The more I get his face out the more someone is bound to see him  
He doesn't wear a collar or anything, he's so incredibly adorable anyone would want him as a pet. If that is the case, I'm hoping he's being fed and taken care of and he's dry and warm. I hope whoever brought him in their home gives him back to me ): I wrote on my 'missing' posters that "he is very much loved and missed and we want him to come home"
No, they usually hang out in the garden, sometimes they wander down to the creek, but they prefer human company for that. 
Mine doesn't wear a collar either because he hates them. I hate that people have to do this, but offering a reward might prompt people to return him faster if they are keeping him.
I think I will have to start offering a reward :( 
Honestly no time like the present, strike while the iron's hot ya dig.  Just don't be one of those freaks that lashes out like a complete asshole if you're rejected cuz that's not cool at all.
I have almost exclusively been calling it "the fart air" so don't sweat it
Holy shit that's gotta be one of the nicest things I've ever read.  You rule.
LOL all yours dude, it's one of my favorites
I always figured if you don't feel this nervous about it you probably don't feel that strongly about the other person. Kind of like how my mum always said if you're not really nervous before an exam you probably don't actually care about it all that much
Thanks for the good vibes man.
Oh yeah totally.  We talked a little bit about the whole "don't want it to get weird if it doesn't work out" scenario so I wanna make it as easygoing as possible.  I'm a simple dingus so all I know is how to be myself anyway, and like you said if that was good enough then hopefully I'm all set.
Right on man that's hilarious lmao.  I've just been a goddamn beacon of positive vibes all day.  Glowing like a motherfucker due in no small part to how awesome the people in this sub are
Thanks so much!  Me too.
Oh no I totally agree.  I learned a long time ago not to do that.  I'm definitely nervous but not... freaking out I guess.  Let's say cautiously optimistic??We've hung out 1 on 1 enough that I'm already sure that it's gonna be awesome.  Just a matter of not doing something catastrophically dumb I guess, whatever the hell that could even be.
Everything's gonna be alright.
tfw dinks :3
I wasn't planning on telling her over text messages so it'll have to wait a few days haha. She's coming over next Thursday, maybe I'll tell her then.And no worries on the anger part, I'm not like that thankfully. I've been rejected before by someone else, I can handle it! 
Hey thanks! Wouldn't that just be the most amazing thing :) I can't wait to find out! 
I don't know how long that means you won't see her, but why not invite her to meet up somewhere to do something fun together? Thinking back I've done that too. We had a two week break so I invited her to go play pool and it was really fun! Plus, you can use that to gauge her interest in you a bit. 
Haha! Perfect. 
Haha! Anytime, bud. 
This whole thread is so /r/wholesomememes
I like to bring in the cannoli element, personally. holy fuckannoli.
yes, but your name is dongbroker.  What is the story behind that?
Let us know how it goes
Aaaahhh, that's exactly the right mindset!!!    You're going to have a great time.    Congratulations....  
I was afraid of the same things for a while until i learned how god damn real this girl is. we have so many laughs together. I hope you guys have a good time. Rooting for ya
Yeah.  Smart.  The text message thing was dumb as hell on my part.  All it did was amplify the anxiety of the situation like tenfold.  Plus I'm better with my mouthwords than my... fingerwords?  Whatever I'm dumb but you got this man it's gonna go well for sure.  FOR SURE
Well she lives about 2 hours away from me, but she's gonna be volunteering at a camp all summer, that's about 8 hours away. I did manage to meet and have dinner with her day before yesterday (I was on my way out of town and was passing through where she lives) and we both had a good time. She leaves for camp this week, and gets back two weeks before classes start. 
Well this is interesting, around here my friends use "holy fuckaroni", with macaroni. I had no idea there were other versions haha
Just wanted you to know that I'm totally stealing "fingerwords" when talking about things like this. That was awesome! 
Oh hey! Nah I didn't. When it comes to moments like these I get scared at the thought of even saying it. It's a fear I'll have to overcome very soon! As for our time together though, it was really fun and sweet. Ended with us laying side by side, my head on her shoulder, playing Life is Strange. So it's not all bad :) 
Aw, that's not easy. I guess beside texting there isn't much to do. All I can think of is video chatting maybe. Be sure to make use of those two weeks between camp and school :) 
I like it, this one actually rolls off the tongue a little bit better
Only if I get to take "Mouthwords"
Ahaha I feel that dude.  When I finally hit send I literally threw my phone down and went for a run without even checking to see if the dang message sent because the idea of sitting there waiting to hear my phone beep was making me borderline nauseous.
I was just browsing the top posts and came across this, I was intrigued, if a bit late :PThat does sound like a lot of fun, I can see why you'd be nervous about doing anything when it seems like you've already got such a good gig going. However, that does sound like youre already pretty close and maybe she wouldn't totally against the idea anyway... If you really do want something more, do yourself (and maybe her) a favour and don't wait too long, you may regret it. I'm nobody to tell you what to do, but that's definitely what I'd say to myself if I could speak to past me. Good luck :)
Yeah for sure. Like I said we're really close friends but I don't know if she sees me in any other way. Guess we'll just have to wait and find out! 
Screw you guys I'm stealing both of them
Yuupp that sounds pretty much like the time I asked her to go to the movies with me. Texting can be the most exciting thing ever sometimes.
Top posts huh, I didn't realize this thread got so big haha. But you're absolutely right, I shouldn't wait too long. I'm still figuring out the how and when and where in my head, but in the meantime I'll just keep having her come over as much as I can. After next week we won't have to worry about college anymore either for a few months, so that should give me all the time I need for that!But I appreciate the advice! It's in line with what some friends have been telling me. I just gotta do it. 
They're both real gems
Always happy to help :) Nice long summer without college, plenty of time to make your move. Good luck man, I hope it goes well for you :)
Thanks! Since this thread is apparently so high on the top posts I'll leave an update here once I've made my move. I'm forgetful as hell though so if future readers here don't see any update, don't worry, just pretend it all went well and I just forgot to update :)
It's about two pages down on top posts of all time. I just tend to read all posts in that for a subreddit, then ignore the sub again for another year haha. Hopefully there's no need to pretend, but good luck :)
HE DA PRESIDENT HE GETS WAT NAME HE WANTS
This is by far the most important thing a president can do if they really want to make a change. And it's not just about elections. It's about how laws are made. How we govern ourselves. How we protect our future
Please allow copyright terms to actually end at some point. A public domain is vital. Please do not allow Hollywood, Chris Dodd and the RIAA to write all copyright laws.
The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan.  Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you.  The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014.  But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.
Thank you for getting NBC to televise this question. You da man.
I think we all knew that this issue would not be addressed. Though it is very important to many of us, his administration's stance on the issue does not shed a favorable light on their campaign and likely will not be addressed. 
He'll never give a straight answer, if any at all
Finally, I CTRL + F'ed "NDAA" and this is the only thing that came up. Don't expect this to be addressed at any point during the campaign, he's not going to try to defend it because it's indefensible.
Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.
Or a picture of him holding a cat with the caption "I R THA PRESIDENT"
This is an awesome question, although potentially dangerous to answer.
How the hell did you guys pull this one off?
20 bucks says he doesn't address this
Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.
If it's not Louis C.K. or Neil deGrasse Tyson you've lost all of reddit's votes.
He will need help from the Canadian prime minister.
He signed an order closing it, and Congress denied funding to put it into effect.
Specifically by persecuting people involved in state sanctioned medical marijuana programs ( which you and Holder promised your administration wouldn't do?). 
I hope he responds with something like, "There's a **[COMMENT REDACTED]** along with a few **[EXPUNGED]**, plus a really cool **[CLASSIFIED]**.
Sorry.   This question is too real.Mr. President, how do you eat your Oreos?
Yeah, because this is a fairly worded question on the issue
It occurs on the state level, it's not his job.
My mother is a public teacher. No Child Left Behind did not help. We need to ensure that our teachers get the support they need to be amazing and give a good education to students! Can you, Mr. President, make the job of "teacher" more prestigious, competitive, and reputable? 
How about the tuition problem that's creating the loans?
I'd like to see how he responds, given that there doesn't seem to be any set deadline for the closing of Guantanamo, nor has he definitively taken one side or the other on marijuana legislation.
The answer will determine who I vote for come November 
I'm actually surprised he was able to answer *any* questions after breaking Reddit.
Said "what the hell is wrong with this guy?" Looked at username. Oh.
Get us out of there. Place is a damn nightmare.
These would be rabid and out to kill.
I saw it on reddit, as a picture of it on TV.
>internet remains the open forum for everybodyI don't think we're worried about it being open.I think we're worried about our government taking away our privacy and unbiased access.What do you say about that?
He faxed a copy of his birth certificate.
I'm surprised the username PresidentObama was even available. Or is the man powerful enough to just take it over anyway? I'd hate to see the leader of the free world reduced to taking a username like TheRealPresidentObama or POTUS69 or xx_BarackObama_xx or something.
I'll take that as "Poppin bottles of Cristale like it's 1969"
> Let me be clearYou just Obama'd Obama.
I love Obama, but I have to say, this is a true politician's response. He didn't ask for inspiring words about the successes of our space program, he asked if we are increasing their budget. I didn't see the words "Yes" or "No" anywhere in that response...
As a guy with an aerospace degree, i regret to inform you that you'll never be in a position where that could happen
Reddit's getting bigger; the president wants publicity for his upcoming campaign.
Under Obama, I believe crackdowns on medical marijuana dispensaries has increased.
yeah actually there is. the pharmaceutical companies are paying millions to the politicians to keep it illegal.
He's too busy answering questions about beer and basketball. 
Links to relevant information; gets bitched at.
He should count his blessings. I'm quietly relieved the top comment isn't from POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS.
Please answer this question!
UGH. I hope it's not some kind of fucking cologne or miracle supplement. 
>Just want to say that George Bush took 8 years to wreck your countryHe didnt take 8 year to wreck it...he was *given* 8 year to wreck it. We handed him that shit on a silver platter.
He's got access to presidential bandwidth :)
This too. This thing crippled reddit for about an hour and a half. Honestly, it's amazing that the President managed to get through enough to post what he did.
Tell me about it.   I haven't gone a day without thinking about it and I have been home for almost three years now.
We can go deeper.
I was very surprised by this as well! But I bet if the president wants a reddit name, there are ways of obtaining it...
It's pretty funny because people used to get scolded for doing a request for Obama because he'd never do one. 
Your parents divorced because of *you*
Gooble Gabble Gooble Gabble.
I'm assuming they'd be monitoring it for threats towards the president, not random pot smokers.
Thank you for showing the president of the United States how classy us redditors can be.
Ahaha... I can just see you telling everyone you know tonight "I corrected the president on his grammar today."
/redditWE'RE DONE HERE.
I feel like this will cause a glitch in the matrix.
Dude, you can't reply to President Obama and type "ejaculated". Dick move bro.
Fox News Headline: Obama posts on popular Child-Pornography hosting website.
Indeed, and it was a question of the utmost importance. 
White house beer:"It is tasty"-Barack "redditor" Obama
I'm always relieved the top comment isn't from POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS, something about that guy scares me..
As a member of the non-US free world. Did my vote get lost in the post?
Let's stick to questions about the movie
So does Michelle.
I'm loving the idea that the president was sitting around frustrated by the 503s like any other redditor. Would have been even funnier if it resulted in a double post...
I've been home for 7. I picked a day of the year that no one else is celebrating for any reason that was important to me and what happened to me there. I take it off every year so I can do something for myself without having to compete with any of the military holidays or making myself known. It helps and things get better. You have my best wishes.
I would have liked to hear an answer to that as well.
Those fuckers didn't even credit your username!  I would write a strongly worded letter to them and burn it under their balls.
I can just see the guy who had the username trying to log in and receive an error message of the sort "You're username has been changed to IamnotPresidentObamaILied due to the fact that the real President Obama would like to Join our community. Thanks, Reddit Staff!!"
that would be the first lady's
AMA Request: God.

Livin' the dream...
I read this, and immediately got a knock on the door. Shit myself.Found myself eating pizza 2 minutes later.
"Hmm, what was the greatest moment of my life? Well, I once corrected the President of the United States, does that count?"
"from" Reddit 
All right, but first let me lecture you on sentence structure...
R.I.P, Socrates82.
The president may be black, but he's not Will Smith. He can't get away with that!
This is the best grammar nazi-ing he will ever get in his life. Correcting the sitting president of the united states. Let him live the dream.
Pack it up people, our job is done.
actually it was caused by 503's
Looks like we got a badass over here
He was being cocky.
Joe Biden?
And get upvoted more than the POTUS.
That's Dr. Mr. Professor President to you.
Indubitably.
Cool! Where are you from?  Guam? Puerto Rico? Virgin Islands?
I was wondering when we were going to get to the rampart jokes. 
PRESIDENTIAL BANDWIDTH!! *hand waving*
Am I the only one that read every one of his posts in his voice?
It's an HTTP header defined in RFC 2616:    X-Let-Me-Through-I-Am-The-President-Of-The-United-States: True

Plot twist: actually crazed murder.
Yes it is! RIP socks.First kitty under Clinton for those who don't know :)
He was reading this.
That would be glorious. Imagine if he did that in a video. 
Did you clean up the shit first?
I think you forgot your punctuations.  Grammar NOTzi
And the history books will read "it is rumored President Obama was bullied about his grammar in an 'internet forum' and from that encounter began to destroy what was once known as the internet"
you mean disappointed. it should have been POTUS_IN_MY_ANUS
We had a good run, but its time to move on.
..I want to watch the credits roll, and I need to finish my drink. Give me a minute!
I think the White House would be happy to know Biden's only into reddit. It might keep him busy enough not to talk to the press, and the worst leak that might come out of it is to know Biden's subscribed to /r/mylittlepony or /r/gonewild. 
Pretty hard to upvote people outside of the internet. I hear they send people to prison for flinging pointed arrow-y things at Presidents.
That completely makes sense now
no my good man, you are not.
I hope not.
That would be a lot of work though...
That sounds like the motto of the internet and an homage to Julius Caesar: Risi, flevi, veni.
Pack up the accounts, you too Apostolate. Yes, and the novelties. Our journey has reached its end. 
... holding out for that extra scene at the end
Biden is the violentacrez. 
Especially in two minutes.  Hardly enough time to clean thoroughly, put shat-upon clothes in the wash, change, answer the door, and start eating.*Which corners were cut*, sir?  Inquiring minds want to know!
Move out. 
Commenting to be in historical thread.
Butt stuff.
I want this AMA just for that line
popcorn tastes good
You either die an admin or live long enough to see yourself host your own AMA
She could however talk about what she's going to do in the future and speak around anything an NDA would cover.
"i stole monitors"
Twitter is @happysquid
More than that, I'm sure she signed an additional non-disparagement agreement in order to get her severance and continue benefits. Can't blame her.Now, if someone else is somehow able to get the true story from her, he/she could convey it in a way that doesn't peg her as the source. 
It actually made it to 14K upvotes (twice). Both times upvotes were suddenly cut in half. Now its at 5K. Something's definitely up.
Which they can, now. It's one, big, gay, whistleblower wedding!
YEP apparently
One day, our benevolent friend will return in a fiery blaze. Not to work for Reddit, but to overthrow the Pao regime! /u/chooter for one, /u/chooter for ALL! BEAR ARMS WITH ME MEN(AND WOMEN), WE ARE ON THE HUNT TO OVERTHROW PAO!
Ne questions, it just gets gilded like a million times. Actually that would mean buying gold. Idk. Some shit along those lines. 
My guess is they are prepping for 1. Sale to an outside company.2. Pay access. And ditching people with issues with 1 and/or 2. But im wrong a lot. 
Reddit's largest stake holder is Conde Nast, which is a subsidiary of Advance Publications, a multi-billion dollar enterprise. I really doubt any bigwig's contract includes a clause about getting bonuses of $4 
She got fired by the company. The website loves her.  
Fuzzing like most posts get all the time. This isn't new.
Pitchforks at the ready men!!!!!!!
What if she liked Dr. Pepper, ever thought of that smart Guy? 
The admins are trying to make this go away.
Back when the CEO gave a shit
And the verification picture is just her holding up a mirror.
Hey. I wanna see Victoria helping herself out!
God damn that was such a ridiculous response from him. It's a perfect example of the serious disconnect between the community and the company.
He said he was laid off and talked shit so Yishan, the CEO at the time came in and said he was fired for being an incompetent dumb ass and basically torpedoed the guys entire future. 
But who verifies the verifier? 
I really hope she didn't have to sign an NDA to get a Severance Package or something.
If she needs time to recover from the stress of being jobless and such, tell her there is no rush whatsoever. her well-being is the most important
Don't do it reddit!! It's just a baby!!! 
Watch out for the Paolice
Keyboards. /u/Airz23 worked for reddit all along. 
"Would you rather be fired by one Pao-sized duck or by 100 duck-sized Pao's?"
I second this.Considering she's posted a few replies after the supposed termination date/time, I presume she still uses her own account.
Well they could before, just not in parts of the US. And the US doesn't affect them since they'd end up in gitmo before they made it to the courthouse.
Overlord Pao's vote is worth 7k normal ones.
Yeah don't let that happen. Just reply to everything with "Tom Cruise" and call it a day. 
New gold feature: you can only access non default subreddits if you're gilded.
Yes exactly. No buying gold until all of this has been sorted out.
Dr. pepper isn't a cola. 
Yishan was far from a good ceo
That wouldn't be very professional. Even if she had done something terrible, it's in everyone's best interest to say nothing.
Wow, she's helping with the AMA of the 2006 Time Person of the Year? 
... why does that sound really dirty to me?
I wonder how much he actually meant that apology, or if he was advised to make it. 
Would the verified become the verifie-ee?
Or one for Reddit. Word on the street is there are some Redditors in the works of creating a whole new website, similar to reddit, without the bullshit administration issue. Cough cough
Id have to move it off my homepage to have the same effect lol
Or make it an "explore the rest of the Internet" day.
If you make the front page but no one reads it, did you really make the front page
Star Wars, Walking Dead, and Game of Thrones SDCC panels are that day too. How exactly did they decide on July 10?
Public masturbation existed before the internet you know. 
Considering that she hasn't said anything when she could have before, this is most likely though. 
NOJOB NOJOB!
If it reaches top AMA post of all time i will eat a pair of my underwear (washed of course but still fairly used)I will film myself too. Screenshot this comment if you want but im serious
Yeah - do you remember that guy who was fired last year then flapped his jaw off in an AMA, then the CEO came on and said: you forfeited your right to benefit of the doubt when you broke your side of the agreement by talking about it (btw, you were a shitty worker too).No doubt Reddit promises to stay quiet if Victoria does. If Victoria breaks that, be ready for a statement explaining exactly why Victoria was let go. Not saying Victoria did something wrong, but it could end up like that guy last year.
She said this wouldn't be an optimal time until everything settles down. Maybe she will get her job back.
Reddit is literally ISIS. 
Maybe i'll get lucky?? ***knocks on wood***
Fuck the Paolice
Finally some fucking closure on those keyboards
You know that Reddit has a few years of gold more than required? /r/thebutton paid 6,5 months of gold in 2 months. So we'd have to give no gold for a very long time.
But he gave a shit, and that's the difference.
And that's an excellent point, too. Sadly, even if she was 100% in the wrong, the community will likely never know, so this assumption that she was wrongly fired will go on.
No no... Zelda is the horse. Link is the sword. 
Look at me   I'm the Time now!
Oh he definitely knew what he was doing.
Either way, the popcorn sure made him salty.
As long as she doesn't get gold, we're good.
*scratches selfYALL GOT ANYMORE OF THEM RUMORS
You have reddit as your homepage? How do you accomplish anything? 
You are weird
Now I wanna make vacation brochures for other websites.Tumblr; come and explore your SJW side!Facebook; everyone you hate!4CHAN; The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all but essential travel to 4CHAN. Travel within 4CHAN remains dangerous given the security situation.
Well blame FPH for the bike idea.
*loads up reddit to complain about not being able to use reddit*
I'm starting to think it'll be impressive if reddit makes it long enough to still have "annual things".
>... your own personal blackout day... I used to call that 'Friday night, Saturday morning'. 
How can the front page exist if Reddit no longer exists?
Not since 9/11, thanks Osama. 
Too soon, man....
Have you properly researched health hazards of either eating underwear or not delivering on a promise to the people of Reddit?Either way, too late. You're on the hook now.
OP DELIVERED! Hope she verified it was her.
/r/paoyongyang
But not *literally* literally...
I've already been shadowbanned once this year. It's a joke and easy to get access back. 
Fight the Pao-er!
I stopped reading months ago, has he seriously never resolved any of that shit? What happened to VP?
But is she a kid or a squid?
It's about the symbolic gesture in these dire times, not about the actual money acquired. I'd say that until we receive a proper explanation and a ***sincere*** excuse over all of this, we stop giving gold altogether. 
Shits for everyone!
That's actually a good tip. You don't need to be the best, you just need to be better than the worst.
Snape kills gandalf on the bridge of the enterprise.
Time keeps slippong.
It's often misunderstood by people who only read the title though.  It's not just dedicated to literally everyone
As if. She'd get tons of gold because people think of gold as giving a gift (which is nice) rather than giving money to Reddit (which is exactly what happens).
My last semester's 2.75 GPA would like to show you how i do it
...Habits are hard to break.
There's so much else on Tumblr besides "SJW stuff" though. How it works is, you only see what you choose to follow.And the porn is GREAT.
There is but it's a disjointed fucked up way to internet just opening Google.com and thinking of things to internet. Life before reddit on the internet is a blur. 
I want to gold you so hard right now
We're sorry for being so preemptive. 
How Can The Front Page Exist If Reddit No Longer Exists?FTFY
I have enough heart problems where i'll probably die before 40, 30 if i continue my current diet  :p
***we can believe***
/u/sygnus Ate a sock on /r/AMD
I totally made this up and don't know her.
I fell off reading as well, but those keyboard man... I had dreams trying to figure them out.
And yet any time someone says we should stop giving gold that comment gets gilded. 
That's how US Presidents are elected.
Okay with the exception of the SF move (which even that I guess I can understand) those are dumb ideas in hindsight but i'd take someone being enthusiastic and trying their best over this.
No, absolutely not. But the rapidity at which /u/dehrmann beat tracks and dissappeared does not lend credit to his case. An employee terminated unfairly due to office politics or a grudge would have put up more fight that that.... certainly one as vocal as dehrmann. It would be interesting to track down /u/dehrmann; in that AMA he said he had already had a new job lined up; and see if he's turned a new leaf and gets his work done, or whether he's bounced from there as well.
That bridges name?Rosebud.
Fly like an eagle.
Doo doo doo doo. John Cena!
I can't tell if that's supposed to be good or not. 
Ironically I did not.Is that ironic?
It's literally all porn to me.
I seriously can't remember anymore. I think there was Neopets? And Yahoo?
>Tho I think having "having one of the biggest social media websites almost completely blackout in my support" on your cv might even that out. Also whoever hires her might even like reddAlthough that can be spun in a good way, if she dishes and says something damaging about reddit (or even cause it to come crashing down) what company would hire someone that is willing to damage their former employer? She has already proven that she is able to be so valuable that it causes mass protests...disclosing why she was fired would be zero value added.
you should probably stop eating underwear then.
You're not cool until you've eaten something for karma. 
Really? I'm surprised people would go on the internet and tell lies. 
And how musical chairs is played. I think we're on to something here
Even the relocation doesnt seem too unreasonable as a business decision.  I was expecting to learn what a shitty person yishan really was, not "uhhh he made a bitcoin clone and sold some reddit t-shirts"... 
Karma and votes will be equally distributed. 
It's impressively average. 2.0 is passing for most American universities, while 4.0 is all A's.
They don't.
like rain on your wedding day
My condolences for your inbox. 
visit my Geocities page for more
 I mean hey things happen
I will eat some garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta if we can get Victoria to do an AMA.
Did not disappoint.
So if I get good enough at musical chairs I could potentially become president?
Yeah, it's hard to monetise a site like reddit. I'd rather they merchandise than try to sanitise the site for sponsorships and ads.
As one of the 1% in karma, I accept this for the greater good and would be happy to distribute my karma.
Many programs require maintaining a 3.0 or 3.25 in your major. 2.0 passing would be pretty rare I think.
They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
Victoria confirmed for her own Netflix show. 
Owners expect a return on the their investment. There's only so much revenue to be had from selling kitschy Snoo stuff. If anyone wants discussion groups with no corporate owners (actually no owners at all) and no ads other than what the spammers post, they should go to usenet newsgroups.
well that's just some grade inflation there then, isn't it.
I know you... Stop appearing everywhere I go!
Victoria confirmed for next top gear host.
Everyone on the stage wrote their own questions.  We shared them with the moderators, then the mods got to as many as possible while maintaining the flow of the debate.
Too many weird, wild things to count.  The most surreal was hearing back from @midnight which I love.
Fake internet points are the best compensation.  Except money.  I likes money.
Gallup does a random sampling of undecided voters in the area in which the debate is held.  This time it was my home town and I was lucky enough to answer when they called.
Between that and what South Park might turn me into I'm pumped.I know Bobby Moynihan would crush the bit, but maybe go Leslie Jones for shock value or something?  I don't know.  I'll get with my writers.
St. Patrick center provides temporary housing, job training, drug counseling, and help with mental health issues.There is a severe homelessness problem in this country.  Most of us are one or two paychecks away from being homeless as well.  We need to start seeing and intervening on their behalf.  
I'm already the sexy Ken Bone so I'm thinking bust out the old Jedi robe / lightsaber combo and be Obi Wan Kenboni
We need more clean plants like mine to be approved for construction.  Older plants can't retrofit to be best in class environmentally because it would drive them out of business. That means we need newer ones manned by the displaced workers from those being retired.

Several companies have approached me for endorsements. I have 2 rules for working with them.1)It's a responsible company that I believe in and that I vet to the best of my ability.  I will do my best not to associate with any companies that hurt the environment or their workers.2)  10% of all money I receive must go to my local preferred homeless charity the Saint Patrick Center in Saint Louis, MO.Same rules for paid appearances.
My uncle called me today and seemed genuinely star struck as if we hadn't been drinking beer together the week before.
As long as it's all in good fun I'm happy to laugh along with all of it.
Radiohead is my all time favorite, nobody blends genres like Thom Yorke and the boys.
I know I look old cause I'm fat and bald and dress like it's 1954, but I'm only 34 and ineligible to run!There are over 2000, yes 2000 legally registered candidates.  One of them must have something to offer.  Get your voice out there for one of them. 
Obviously reducing energy usage in the winter by providing everyone with stylish red cable knit sweaters, duh. 
He talked to me about the peak of the coal industry in the 20s and how it has evolved with the nation's infrastructure over the years.  Then his security team reminded him that it was time to go yet again.  I think his wife was waiting on him.

He sort of? answered this on his Jimmy Kimmel appearance I think, basically said he turned on his cell phone as soon as he was allowed and had a thousand+ messages lol
Porque no los dos?You don't fill out a sweater like this by doing pizza anything half way.
I'm sorry you're confused, Ken Bone is the cable knit sweater wearing a fat guy.
Ken Bone.  You don't have to be 35, and you don't have to get elected.
Maybe his wife's name is Anita. 
Yes, definitely.  Being undecided is not the same as being indecisive.  We just have a lot to consider this election.  
Sandwiches are bread on top, bread on bottom.  Hot Dogs are side to side with a wrap around.  Doesn't count.
My power plant supports a robust drug testing policy, sorry Dogg.  My dad on the other hand is all in.
I'm close, but I will not be announcing my decision.  I want you to all make up your own minds.  Don't rely on my opinion, just the positive message.
It's been unreal, both the good and the bad.  Everybody has responded to the positive message with the exception of a few nuts.Some of the stuff makes it tough to stay positive, but I try to spin it for the good.For instance, I've had almost a quarter million new Twitter followers, and only 3 death threats.  Great ratio!Seriously though, thanks to my home town PD for making me feel safe when the creeps come out to play.
I wanted to hear more about environmental protection from Mr. Trump, and more about jobs from Secretary Clinton. They both did alright, but all answers from politicians are pretty much canned and rehearsed.  Kinda like the ones I do on the radio.
It was a bad call.  I need to fire my agent, except I can't because I'm my agent.
It's flattering, but please don't.  I cannot serve since I'm not old enough.
Not Barney.  He's too huggable even for me.  
Somebody set one up on my behalf, but Jimmy Kimmel is buying me a new one since I did his show.  I guess if go fund me sends me that money it'll go to the charity.  You'll see me wearing it on his show next week.
I had this weird hallucination where all the sudden everyone gave a shit what I had to say.  Bizarre.
I don't even go to HOA meetings,  but if I really thought I could effect positive change I'd consider it.
If only I were that clever.
I'm in LA late next week, maybe we can hook up. Big fan here. My dad wants to roll wit da Dogg big time, you me and him could do some tight stuff.That didn't sound cool at all, did it?
Without our future generations of doctors we can never solve the healthcare dilemma in this country! You are the future!

What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while remaining environmentally friendly, and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
We both worked at a bowling alley in Granite City called AMF Bowland.  I was a lane attendant which meant I walked around cleaning, throwing away beer bottles, and getting stuff from storage over to the bar and snack bar to restock during shift.She worked the snack bar, which meant I did none of the stuff listed above.  I just watched her clean the grill cause when she bent to scrub it I could see dat ass was fat.

I prefer Bone out, sadly that means they are no longer truly chicken wings.
The mods got to as many as time permitted, but we did not know the order.  The reason is, let's say the economy discussion is going great, they do another audience question on it.  Name calling gets out of hand again? Total topic change, skip all the rest on the economy.  Because of this mod controlled flow we got a better discussion, but the audience has no warning that their question is coming.
The camera is still in my bag undeveloped.  I'll tweet some of the pics out when I get them done.
Had a goatee for a while, full on neck beard for about a year.Clean shaven for a long time.The stache is for my grandpa, the first Ken Bone who tied in (not lost, it died too) his battle with cancer two days before Christmas last year.  His stache was unparalleled.

I breathe the same air and drink the same water as you.  My job doesn't change that.  We only get one Earth and we're doing a shit job taking care of her.  I feel that my plant is operating in a responsible way, but as a whole we are going to need big energy innovation if we want our grand kids to have the same planet we do.
Good to know The Bone writes his own material
WE LOVE YOU TOO, KENNETH. It actually delighted me to hear you read my tweet. Thank you for doing the show, encouraging people to vote and being an all-around good dude! PS - Team Mystic
And the gold. Can't forget about reddit gold
Ken Bone answered the call.
I hope if South Park does feature you its in some completely crazy random way, like you are a galactic invader with the Bone-ers.
I heard Moynihan and Piece of Toast have huge creative differences 
Man are you seriously that good? Wow!! Insightful, conscientious, super funny, compassionate and intelligent. Why the fuck couldn't you be our president?!
>Obi Wan KenboniHow does it feel to be a genius?
How do you feel about nuclear power?
I feel like this comment perfectly sums up why we needed Ken Bone. Everyone is so exhausted from all the hostility, hyperbole, and factionalism this election has unleashed. We thought we were getting a meme and ended up getting a refreshing reminder that there are still chill people in this country.
What if I'm an asshole?
That is incredibly kind of you to share your good fortune with those in need. Thank you.
You changed
I think you are making a lot of people happy in a good way.
How can someone possibly be so likeable
So you're saying that a 2020 candidacy is possible? 
I'm not gonna say you're wrong...Because you aren't. Cable knit sweaters are a gift.
Classic Ken Bone
Calm down, Linda? 
I like to think Bill went around to each questioner and gave the answer he imagined himself giving if he were in the debate. Excellent that he had something like that teed up to talk to you about. Did Trump or anyone from his team talk to you after?
I'd watch that sitcom.
You should drunkenly shitpost with us in some /r/cardinals GDTs next season!
Your answer is better than any I could think of.  
This guy gets it.
we're not worthy.

Not hiding behind throwaways to comment on porn subreddits, you are an inspiration to us all.

Chewie.  No net loss or gain in huggability.
You say this, and we're all creeping the shit outta your post history like "he was among us the whole time!"
The rare verb form of "effect." Nice. 
Bone apple teeth
We need a tv show Give A Dogg A Bone where you and snoop are detectives. His old partner (one day from retirement) is gunned down and you're his new partner. It's like a photonegative Miami vice. 
Id say its probably the best thing to come from the election thus far.
It's weird seeing a post where you immediately know it's going to the best of reddit.
Every president needs a portrait of them done, Ken
You beautiful man. 
Mine was "So long and thanks for all the fish" So you got me beat
You need to be the 5th face on Mount Rushmore
Listen, how is every one of  your responses perfect? How is it possible? Great people can be at a loss for the perfect response, but Bone, never. 
Dang. Before I was joking, but you're actually a viable candidate. 
Hats off to Oriel for bearing the name with pride.
Hey it me, your me
Ken the very fact that you're still responding 2 hours after the AMA gives me all the proof that you are capable at handling the highest office in the land. 
Ken... I don't know how you are still going. I have never enjoyed reading an AMA so much.
The Rams just went for some smokes, don't worry about it.-Los Angeles
6 hours later and you're still replying to people, that's commitment.
Your way of looking at the hard problems of the world (cancer, homelessness, the environment) is a lesson to us all. I would ask if you would consider being a philospher, but you already are.
Just give this comment in with your essay OP. Ken's already marked it for the teacher.
Instructions unclear; dick stuck in sweater.
Hey I just want to say I'm glad you aren't in that position anymore. 
Ken's too big for you now. Won't even you hit u back up in his AMA. 
Gooble Goo
REAL fake internet points
This current season has so far had a strange lack of any sort of sci-fi element. What gives?
Because he's 34, and you have to be 35 to be president. I might vote for him anyway. 
> Obi Wan KenboniGod it just works so well.
It's cost effective as fuck, and safer than people think.  Ok, I'm, biased.  Nuke worker, but I believe in my opinion.  For reference, I also used to work for the oil companies, and yes, they are as evil as every one thinks they are.
You are my new publicist. 
Time to Bone to clothe the homeless. 
I certainly haven't changed clothes.
With how toxic this election cycle has been, this is the healthiest thing to happen to the country. We desperately needed a distracting laugh.   
Authenticity, my man.

Can we all agree this is the greatest AMA ever?
Boners for America
He's always known as one of the best networkers and connectors in the entire world. He can make you feel genuinely important and befriended in 30s. 
Billy and the Bone! 
Dude, as a formerly undecided fan of yours, I've decided now to endorse you.  Bone2020^(TheYear^NotHisVision)
Do you feel, Your Boneness, that since your notoriety, you've remained just about the same Bone as ever/
Holy shit!  u/dicklemytick is talking to me!!!
I for one welcome our new overlord
This guy bones
Mr. Bone has flaws like all of us. However his flaws are like our own which makes him feel that much more relatable.
Ivana Bone?  Ivana Bone?  Anyone hear named Ivana... oh Goddammit
The cardigan is just body hair.
It's a good thing I'm not running for office.  I'm just trying to get you all to vote, you don't need to have another fat guy trying to convince you who to vote for.
I wonder if John Hodgman is going to be annoyed at our new consensus after years of getting pushback on his hard-line hot-dogs-aren't-sandwiches stance.

God damn people here are clever 
Translation: Pretty decent dude not using his position to influence people's decision based on fame.
Those who are jealous of his glory.
Ken is a straight shooter with upper management written all over him.
I made a comment earlier today. It was in regards to a guy with a two-tone dick. I'm locked in on my vote.
I added a link to his full comment. Real as can be!
No fucking way, did he really say that?
The Bone Zone. 
When the bone train stops, we all stop
Agreed, but he's only at 6 stars for now.
I don't know if I should feel bad or good about this. I like to think we're all a little bit of Ken. Maybe we've all got a small bit of bone in us. 
What this guy is trying to say is, it would be a landslide.
This is closer to the real me.
Oh Jesus Christ I hope I dream this movie tonight
Ken Bone 2020: A beautiful goddamn disaster.
I'm just going to comment to say I was here. 
yea, quit skirting the tough questions Bone.
lmfao i'm dead. this ama and all the comments are too perfect.
It's like he's made from Reddit. Skynet has begun. There's no way he can be human. 
Legally, he's not sadly. 
Ken doesn't send pussy pics, he receives them. ALL.
KBJ must be the coolest dude ever. I bet he has a red sweater too.
Charlie get off reddit and back to bashing rats
Chris wasn't with him when he was shooting in the gym.
He replied to me! I've peaked.
Perhaps real life is strange enough on its own right now
I love that you're still answering questions. Most AMAs they stick around for like 20 minutes and leave 90% of the questions unanswered.

Ken Bone 2020"Not his vison. Ours."
I think so, just a little rushed.  It'll set in when life slows back to normal, but I'm trying my best to stay the same old me.  I like me.
It is an honor Ken. Stay Golden and thanks for bringing honesty back to politics.
From the Dickle my Tick forum?
I posit that it is actually a holomemetic universe wherein the memes occupy an n-1 brane on the outer surface of the space we all use to post dog and cat pics.
I'm voting for you.
He's probably more worried that he's been replaced by Ken Bone in the hearts and minds of Americans. 
Hahahaha holy shit
Theres just a lot of us so when we are clever it gets a lotta upvotes. We're all dumb as bricks, dont worry mate
I think he would be more depressed that his decision influenced anyone. Ken Bone seems like the kind of guy that ask "what does this say about our political system?". 
Those dethroned by the Bone.
So ken, what exactly would you say you do here? 
TWO TONE MALONE!
My God...he is...*perfect*.
Ken Bone already has a sex scandal!
I want to be closer to the real you.

Read that in stan's voice...
Legit not a bad idea, the money could go to the charity he spoke of. Or just buy one million identical sweaters.

HOW CAN HE CLAP?!!
The ol' reddit dillemma-- we all look smart, but it's just a few good comments standing on a pile of shit. Still better than youtube/facebook

You're gonna regret saying that
Do you have what it takes to enter the Bone Zone?
Like a Dogg with a Bone.
I'm crying what a time to be alive
I read THAT in Randy's voice

He is all that embodies us.
I'm happy I expanded that comment
Every single moment of my life has led up to this moment, the most important moment. I am ready.

He could pull a Luke Cage and get shot up a buncha times and sell his bullet-hole ridden hoodies.But in this metaphor the bullet holes are just sweat and B.O. and the hoodies are sweaters.
They cannot win. Reddit needs its true hero. We can do these things, because we're not heroes like Ken. We are whatever Reddit needs us to be.
One minute. Gilded. Nice.
Today, we are all Ken Bone.
I say he is the new leader.
I vote Bone king of Reddit, all in favor say aye 
Congrats on getting out, and best of luck on your recovery! I would also love to read your AMA if you ever feel up to it. 
Yes, every "therapy room" is equipped with cameras and listening devices, as admitted by the "Church."  Do they use it for blackmail? No, they use it to discredit you when you speak out. 
When you reach the top of The Bridge (OTP 8) you will be told that God is a lie for LRH, and there are more levels ahead, that will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. There is no end to Scientology.  
That would not be allowed from their end. 
I am an SP (supressive person). You are not allowed to be in contact with an SP. I would love to talk to my former friends and see my goddaughter. 
Weird reactions? No. I got appropriate reactions, "Why are you in this crazy shit?" 
I felt alone. If you ever confided in friends then you were (as policy dictates)... reported and turned in. Very 1984, very George Orwell. 
Do I think? I know. Hi Karin Pouw and members of OSA! If any Sea Org member is currently reading this and works for OSA and wants to leave, I will help you... including Karin. 
Most Scientologists are 2nd or 3rd generation, they were born and raised into an ideology and have been surrounded and isolated. It is all they know. They are victims. Most of the original Scientologists are all out and have spoken out. Unfortunately, their children were indoctrinated by them.... are still loyal, faithful and have cut off communication due to the policy of disconnection. 
Because i was taught to believe that the controversy was due to people being unaware of what Scientology was truly doing in the world which was good things. I also felt the press was focused on making fun of Scientology and not what was important, so it was easy to turn away from the information. And also a major part of Scientology is learning how to fight your critics. If i wasn't fighting I wasn't being a good Scientologist. 
Speak to your local councilmen/women about cracking down on the abuse of its citizens. I believe people have influences, they know judges, lawyers, police enforcement I think everyone bringing attention to these abuses can help. It takes a community to police itself. 
The higher up is singular. And he definitely knows. however I believe most parishioners and Sea Org members  (people who work for the "church") are int he dark and believe that they are doing amazing things for the world. And David Miscavige is directly responsible for that fraud. 
Long term struggle, however, seeing the "church" attack those who were speaking out, those who gave their life, life savings, their children to this organization that were once considered exemplary Scientologists or staff members of the church to being liars, bitter apostates, and what ever vile sophomoric, vitriolic adjective they can find overnight says a lot about the organization. 
It's very upsetting. I'm only an actress with a short window of interest. So it is up to the authorities who have to do something about it and the judges who are hearing cases of abuse, coerced abortions, being held prisoner, fraud, mental and emotional imprisonment. They won't look at cases to decide its a religion. They have to separate and look at the law. Your doctrine is abusive. It mandates that you abuse people. 
The policies of the "Church" are the policies of the "Church." They will not change, and there will be someone right behind him ready to pick up where he left off. 
Yes my first reaction was "Are you all fucking nuts?" and then I looked at my mother and said "What kind of bullshit did you get me in?" My only option was to leave, but at the time my family was not ready to go. The "church" told me I didn't need to believe it, just do it. And they always pose this question: "Are you ready to leave everything you've ever known?"
I was punished for doing Stuff magazine because it was too racy. They would not want us to do anything that would be considered not "becoming of a Scientologist." I see they have since changed their stance of what they believe is "becoming of a Scientologist." 
If you really look at the numbers at the entertainment industry, in comparison to the small number of scientologists that are celebrities, the number wouldn't even register. I think Scientology has done an amazing job convincing people that there is a great number of celebrities in the "Church." 
They gain a purpose. They gain a group. They gain a sense of accomplishment (awards, certificates). They gain an education that in the real world LRH states would be equivalent to getting a "PHD in life." You become an elitist. That you have all the answers in life. If you have a question about life, you are made to think that Scientology has the answer. 
I have read stories on the internet. I was told personally by a few people that I personally know that there was sexual abuse. When I was 16 and working for a "senior Scientologist" who was in his late 30's, he had sex with a 16 year old friend of ours. And the "Church" handled it internally. All abuses are dealt within the "Church" as it is an enemy act in the "Church" to prosecute another member. Please do not take my word for it, just google the words "Scientology and sexual abuse." 
I am. I'm okay with it because I knew what I was getting into and I knew the policies of the "church" and what would happen by my speaking out against it. 
The policy of the "Church" does not allow them to come to me. Former high ranking Sea Org members like Debbie Cook and former members like Katie Holmes are forbidden to speak to other SPs. Certain members are forced to sign agreements that does not allow them to speak to ex members. 
Thank you! Watch our show tonight and spread awareness. It is bigger what people think. This religion is massive. 
As old spirits in little bodies who have returned to Scientology... children are treated as adults. 
Yes, I feel very safe. I have the support of my family and friends. And, I feel strangely protected by the world at large. 
I would say the "church's" Fair Game policy, and how they systematically go after anyone who publicly speaks out against them. Anyone who speaks out against the "church" is seen as an enemy. 
When I was a Scientologist I saw Hollywood as a dark, lost bunch of souls that needed saving. Now I see it as any other business and that we're all just trying to do right by ourselves, right by our friends and family and that people outside of scientology are not bad. 
Yes my view of religion changed in that I am no longer a bigot against people's religious beliefs when it doesn't harm other people, promote killing people for their beliefs... like extremism. But if religion brings you comfort, hope, and a sense of community, I say "whatever works for you." 
No, and if they did hear about it, we were told that those claiming abuse were lying. Then I would have been interrogated and even punished for asking. 
The "Church" doctrine thinks that fields of psychology and psychiatry are a sham. They deny mental illness and afflictions. They promote that you can heal your psycho-sematic issues with their "technology." They will get in the way of people taking medications. They will prevent people from getting the real medical help that they need. and in some cases have caused suicides because of it. Scientology is mentally abusive because we are all taught that we are responsible for everything. 
I'm sure there were tools that helped me to be able to communicate better, not be nervous when I walked in the room. Acting classes would have been cheaper. Or maybe staying in Brooklyn a little longer would have been more beneficial to my acting career. 
I don't want to destroy Scientology. I only want them to admit to the fraud that they promote, to not deny the confidential upper levels of the religion, so people can decide if they want to spend $250K and their lives doing it. That they admit to the policies of Fair Game. That they allow people to decide for themselves where they get their information. That they admit to disconnection and leave families the fuck alone. 
Doesn't look like got to this comment, but she said in another response that her first step to leaving was how quickly the "church" would turn on anyone who wronged them, even people who dedicated their lives to Scientology. 
No, I'm not an atheist. It's not about being anything now. I do have faith in God. I do not judge people for their faith. I judge people who use religion to hurt people. I don't believe in a religion that shuns people for their beliefs, or that you should hurt people for their beliefs. 
That's not downvotes, that's just a Reddit algorithm to prevent posts from staying on the front page too long. It's perfectly normal 
Greater awareness. Exposing the truths. Not letting to continue to let them bully people into silence and submission. 
They don't tell you about Xenu until you're at OT III - Operating Thetan level 3. You won't get that far until you've spent many thousands on auditing and classes. Most people never make it that far.The thing is, Xenu is actually an incredibly important part of the religion. It's the explanation of why there is so much suffering on earth. It'd be like if Christianity didn't let you know about the crucifixion until you'd donated egregious sums of money to your church.
I'm a big fan of Louis Theroux, but I thought that was one of his worst documentaries.  Going Clear was a much better doc on the subject IMO.
She grew up in the religion. Her mother left when she did.
from what little research I've personally done, it seems like the super early "getting your life on track" and "self help" seminars and such they promote are actually useful. It seems that after that it starts to go all crazy and over bearing. They have to bait the hook with something anyways.
I'm trying to figure out how I'd provide proof. 
I'm sure that ex scientologists can get therapy, but ex scientologists would not go to group therapy - particularly those who aren't necessarily "out" as ex scientologists. They would be afraid that the church would find out about and plant someone in the group to report back all the bad things they said about the church. There are a lot of non-practicing former scientologists who didn't necessarily have any sort of falling-out with the church and still have friends/family inside who they would not want to be disconnected from.
> Do they use it for blackmail? No, they use it to discredit you when you speak out.If they make it clear that those are the consequences beforehand, that is indeed textbook blackmail.
Do they just make this shit up as they go?
To what degree did the church maintain control over your career? Did you have to consult with them about the projects you were involved in? 
>and see my goddaughter.Awww man.  I'm sorry, I hope you get to see her again. :(
And what was your response to them then?
Everyone say Hi Karin!!
This is whats terrifying about Scientology. Not only is it dangerous in its Fair Game policies and abuse of religious freedom laws, but despite its young age, it's already beginning to indoctrinate children as a primary function... It should have been gone decades ago, but it's held on.
I was raised in the Jehovah's Witness religion cult. I've gotten the same question and my answer is very close to yours lol. 
Holy shit, there's a church here where I live. I had no idea.
Sounds like North Korea.
I get the feeling you're a very sincere and realistic person from reading your answers. I hope more people are able to open their eyes and move on. 
So how do we stop them?
Can someone eli5 what ot3 is?
How do they punish you? Financially? Physically? Psychologically?
The convincing part is absolutely terrifying. 
People are always saying they think scientology offers nothing. As true as that may be in reality, many of those things sound wonderful and are very much sought after in life. People have innate need for them and are drawn to all sorts of groups and ideologies in their search for them. I think this is an important answer and something that people need to be very careful about when they are lead in their search for answers in life. 
More power to you!
Which is why in her autobiography she spilled all her (and her family's) dirty laundry so they'd have nothing to hold over her head
> former members like Katie Holmes are forbidden to speak to other SPsI may be interpreting this wrong, but why TF would a former member care about the rules?
> children are treated as adultsThat is freaky as fuck.
I have tremendous respect for you and what you've done since leaving the "church." You have a lifetime fan in me just for that...and for playing Stacey Carosi on Saved By the Bell.Keep up the good fight!
How is it that you are still able to speak out against them?  What is different about your situation than the others that have tried and been shut down?
"Those claiming they were abused were lying! Here, let me abuse you to prove to you that you are wrong to question if abuse happens here!"
AND Scientology creates SUCH internal stigma and distrust of doctors especially psychiatry that even decades after people leave they may still be suffering and completely refuse help. Its a REAL mind fuck and gift that keeps on giving.  
That, itself, would probably destroy the "church"
Well... that's kind of a scary answer.
It's really great of you to go back and find the answer for him
Loving this AMA. I'm surprised the government hasn't cracked down on these psychos by now. Then again depressingly enough, it's probably because the feds and states side with them.
So, it's like a "religion" with shit ton expensive DLC's? 
The podcast "Oh No Ross and Carrie" investigated Scientology by taking their seminars.  It was an interesting and entertaining listen.  It sounds like if your life is even remotely on-track that their seminars and advice are laughably useless.  You're being advised by the lowest members, many of whom are recovering addicts and others who severely needed direction in life.
Contact the mods of the subreddit. They figured out a way to prove a guy actually ~~slept with~~ was raped by his mom on a regular basis as a teenager. They'd probably be able to verify you. EDIT (4 months): Corrected my language to more accurately describe.
Seriously, I used to be ashamed admitting I blew a $20k settlement in my 20's on bullshit and weed. I can only imagine coming to that realization. 
"Church of pls pay my student debt-ology"
They probably don't. What I think she means is that they don't sit you down and threaten you before they do it, which she doesn't consider technically blackmail. It's probably what their legal team argues too, but I still think it's blackmail.
She published the dirty laundry herself so their tactic cannot succeed.
I think one of the scariest things about Jenna Hill's book is that if he let his own niece be treated like that, imagine what happens to everyone else not related to him!?
Absolutely.Scientology will go balls-out to make sure a spouse doesn't leave with children.They'll very often start with threats/intimidation and quickly escalate to having the other parent file kidnapping charges/pursue it as a parental abduction. At that point, they're pulling out all the stops in the propaganda/blackmail aspects to smear reputations and paint the escaping parent as unfit, and throwing the resources of Scientology into custody battles. 
Hmm... nobody has gotten this far, quick, make up some more shit, we've got a real sucker this time. 
Fuck just seeing her, i hope she gets to HELP her. From the evidence presented here that poor kid is in for more than just a missing godmom.
I didn't know it until now but this might be the question I most want answered in this thread.
#HI KARIN! COME ON OUT.  WE HAVE COOKIES! 
The best way for us to support her right now is to tune in tonight to watch her special. Scientology sends letters DAILY to the TV networks to try to make them cancel her shows or prevent them from giving her shows. 
nothing suspicious there 
Raised Mormon. Same here. 
Scientology points to their front groups (Narconon, CCHR - which fights against psychiatry, related medications & drugs, and their Volunteer Ministers who show up at disasters offering a pamphlet -Way to Happiness- and touch assists to "heal" people. They don't actually do things for society or offer true charity like most churches do. 
Not sure about PTS, but an SP is a "Suppressive Person"
Boggles my mind that it hasn't been brought to an end yet!
4chan tried about a decade ago, they did manage to draw thousands of people in protests around the world and they tried attacking the church's tax-exempt status but I dont think they went too far on that last one
The Xenu stuff: intergalactic warfare and aliens being brought to earth and blownup in volcanoes... and that the tortured souls of those dead aliens are clinging to humans and causing all our ills. 
Seriously... I keep reading through all of her comments and keep seeing the word, "punished." Wtf are they doing to people? 
I think in Going Clear it said they were using his homosexuality to blackmail Travolta to keep him in check. 
I would have a very rational fear of being suicided.
She definitely has some hyper armor
Yup get it out of the way so nothing else is surprising. "But you had a!....wait...OK but certainly this!...hm..." makes your credibility way harder to take down.
Yep! /u/MaxLyman and /u/HannahNewman875, for example!
They are actually behind you right now.  Don't turn around though. If they realize you know that they're there, they will snatch you.Wait until they get bored. Open another tab to the most shameful porn video you can find and start getting comfortable until they get uncomfortable to leave.
More scientology
Check out the documentary Going clear (2015) . The punishments can get physically and mentally hardcore  (beating, humiliation...)
The cult still has dirt on them that they don't want released. My question is what kind of shit could they have on someone that the public would really give a shit about?
Explains a lot of the weird stuff around Suri Cruise.Also, Leah said she hasn't read anything that is innaccurate. I wonder if that includes that claim that Scientology believed Suri Cruise was LRH?
Holy shit.  She did. 
*2 years from now*TIL Leah Remini was last heard from after doing a Reddit AMA about Scientology 
^ I Found Jericho's Reddit account!
>  How can any member of such an organization still convince themselves that they are "the good guys doing whats necessary"?From watching Going Clear it's because of all the blackmail. They have their member's secrets recorded under the guise of confessions.
Hell of a lot more visibility and fame than a regular person. 
Beatings will continue until moral improves. 
But that's the point. People should be allowed to believe in whatever crazy nonsense they want to believe. As long as they know it's a shitty scam and they still want to believe that Xenu will suck their dick 3 times a week once they reach Thetan level Xeta-2, that's their right.
Horrifying answer..... 
Trying to dig up dirt on two guys who showed up on the red carpet wearing dresses and tripping on acid - I doubt they'd really give a damn.
They tried, the IRS attempted to take them off tax exempt status and in return the "church" infiltrated the IRS and threatened the life and well being of the IRS director and his family.
I wish I could get a $20k settlement to waste on bullshit and weed :(
Good point. 'Not technically' crimes seems to be their bread and butter.
It was almost like she was abused worse *because* she was related to the leader. It makes no sense.
She seems like a really kind and humble person. So glad she was able to find freedom and create the life she wants.
In my head, this is exactly how I imagine those conversations. 
"Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?"Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O'Brien."I have not betrayed Julia," he said
'sup, Karin?
Another shitty pay-to-win title.
/u/TheRealLeahRemini Should fill in the blanks.
She's right over there, see for yurself! Oops, she just got on that bus, you didn't look fast enough.
In Jenna Miscavige  Hills book, Beyond Belief, most of the punishment, for kids at least, was harsh physical labor. Loss of privileges, being ostracized, demeaning jobs, etc.
Wait... There are people who think Travolta is straight???
A great way of disarming someone is to be entirely candid and honest about oneself.
The beatings will continue until morale improves
Read the book. It's even more detailed and frightening. RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force, I believe) is nothing to fuck with.
Have they ever revealed secrets of any celebs before?
Katie has their daughter. Her ex already programmed his first kids against their mother. The threat of doing that to the daughter, taking her away, or constantly going after custody in court would keep almost any mother quiet, to keep her child safe and with her.It makes sense. How very sad for both of the women who had children with him.
> Explains a lot of the weird stuff around Suri Cruise.Care to elaborate?
> This sci-fi writes itself.This Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode writes itself
During an investigation, police suddenly decided it was a suicide for sure
Something something stupid idiot, something $750 scarf
And she doesn't have ties left to Scientology like family members
I know, I'm the fucking worst. It was going so well too before I came along.
That is an almost comically grotesque method of suppressing dissent. Also if the IRS can't stop them, who can or will?
Pro-tip: get hit by a drunk driver. 
It does make sense though. People in the church probably think "he let his own niece be treated like that, imagine what's gonna happen to me?"
Gotta stop that power creep
L. Ron Hubbard. Dreamt up scientology 
Shall we round up the mob, pitchforks and torches, maybe go bust her out?
We did it, reddit! 
There's a cult where I'm from called the Twelve Tribes. They're like this weird hippie Judeo-Christian communal group. I've seen them lure in musicians like that by having acoustic nights at the restaurant they ran. They even have big busses they take to music festivals to recruit out of.  
I...I did...up until this thread...
Doesn't matter if anyone cares as long as they can make him believe people care. And there definitely are people that care.
The B Rabbit tactic. 
> The beatings will continue until ~~morale~~ thetan levels improve
Yea, I'd rather fuck with Wu-Tang than RPF
They wouldn't do it directly. We'd see it as a leak of some kind, maybe an expose by a former acquaintance, etc. So probably, but not directly. 
There were claims made by ex scientologists that her bedroom was prepared for LRH. They had his favorite books and his robe laid out on the bed. That she was served his favorite meals. Things of that nature.Then you have the stuff the media grabbed a hold of where she was dictating major decisions for her parents, more or less controlling every aspect of her own rearing. If Scientologist children are treated like adults, Suri was treated like an adult with authority. Allegedly.
Holy crap. did you come up with this just now? i always thought the name seemed strange, but could never pinpoint why.

Very different populations. The 4chan of 10 years ago is nothing like the 4chan of today.
I got ID'd, followed, harassed, and shoved by the local OSA head (hi, Cathy!) when I was part of Chanology back in Houston and Austin in 2008."Always attack, never defend" was not something they were prepared to have turned back on them... nor was the rasterbated poster about how female Sea Org members were forced to have abortions.
Ah, man.  They nerfed OT VIII... again...
Failed science fiction author turned successful cult leader.
I've seen that movie many times and had to check IMDB because I didn't know Artie Lange was in it, and forgot Leah Remini was in it too.
You obviously havent seen any of the mission impossible movies. Tom Cruise will kill us all. Please Mr.Cruise spare us!

Although I appreciate your dedication, I feel I should warn you. Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with, sir
I remember laughing at Katie saying Suri picks out all of her outfits for her, but now D: Glad Katie was able to get away, and if that means Tom not being in Suri's life it's worth it in this case. 
"Looks like another case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Seems like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy."

not to mention, the anonymous of today almost completely divorced from the 4chan of today
Heh, mine was Brian in the Minneapolis org. He was never very physical, but I can't count the number of times he would try and do the mind control stare down and ask me "what are your crimes?" and "why do you feel the need to do this?" over and over.
Pffft. All I have to do is put my hand on his forehead to hold him back. We've got reach that Tom could only dream of!
Jesus Christ Karin get your shit together
At this point, one has to question if it was ever open in the first place.
~~Written and Directed~~ Prophesied by L. Ron Hubbard.
Literally a cult classic. 
> if i recall, Will Smith donated to scientology out of respect/friendship with Tom Cruise, and donated at the same time an equal or larger amount to a Christian organization.  No actual ties to the "church".  Dont quote me on this...I have never spoken to Big Willie Style personally.~ */u/thezombiesaurus*
I wonder just how damaged that kid is. 
Actually it's the Jeritron 6500 now.... 
I heard if you punch Tom Cruise in the nose he instantly leaves you alone and that is the one thing you should do in that specific survival situation.
> Jesus ChristSlow down, one religion at a time here
And he is about to find out..... That being a cult leader is super fun and lucrative if you enjoy controlling and abusing people!
Honestly, that is a deep burn.
what a great bot, doing God's work.

I see a lot of hate from people, not necessarily on this site, who claim you can't learn anything from watching a cartoon like South Park. I could name a dozen episodes that all held astute positions on many things. The Scientology episode is no exception. It tells the truth but because the truth is so absurd you can't seem to actually believe it. 
I sometimes wear a hat. For example when I did college tours with my son I wanted the focus to be totally on him. A lot less people recognize me when I have a hat on or else they realize I am trying to be incognito.Mostly when people do recognize me they are super nice so I don't feel it is a burden to be noticed most of the time.
I would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn't very good socially back then but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that - maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up....
Warren Buffett has always said the measure is whether the people close to you are happy and love you. It is also nice to feel like you made a difference - inventing something or raising kids or helping people in need.
Australia is particularly nice. It is summer there when it is winter here so going there in December and January is especially nice. I spent Thanksgiving there last year.I have gotten to travel to a lot of great places like the Amazon in Brazil which I recommend.
I will be 76 at that time. Hopefully a grandfather. The Foundation with its partners will have eradicated a number of diseases and health in poor countries will be a lot better - specifically instead of 5% of children under 5 dying it should be at 2.5% which is still a lot.I hope I can still type fast enough to do Reddit sessions without someone transcribing for me.
The big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do. There is a lot of work going on in this field - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, academia,... Right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test.Another whole area is vaccines. We need a vaccine for HIV, Malaria and TB and I hope we have them in the next 10-15 years.
you cannot buy time. 
Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger.
I would say education is the key problem. If you can solve that then it helps with a lot of things.Maybe I didn't understand the question - maybe it supposed to be some idiosyncratic thing that bothers me....
A lot of people feel a sense of isolation. I still wonder if digital tools can help people find opportunities to get together with others - not Tinder but more like adults who want to mentor kids or hang out with each other. It is great that kids go off and pursue opportunities but when you get communities where the economy is weak and a lot of young people have left then something should be done to help.
We need clean, reliable cheap energy - which we don't have. It is too bad the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. The Economist had a good piece on this this week. So we need some invention - perhaps miracle batteries or super safe nuclear or making sun into gasoline directly.
The main "copying" that went on relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did in creating graphical interface - it wasn't just them but they did the best work. Steve hired Bob Belville, I hired Charles Simonyi. We didn't violate any IP rights Xerox had but their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows.
Overall like Warren Buffett I am optimistic about the long run. I am concerned in the short run that the huge benefits of how the US works with other countries may get lost. This includes the aid we give to Africa to help countries there get out of the poverty trap.
I just went on a trip with my 17 year old son to see 6 colleges. He is a junior in High School and trying to figure out where he should go. Trips like that have been a great way to spend time together. He reads even more about politics than I do so I let him pick books for me to read.Melinda is very creative about helping me find chances to spend time with the kids. Even just driving them to school is a great time to talk to them.
Over time countries will be rich enough to do this. However we still have a lot of work that should be done - helping older people, helping kids with special needs, having more adults helping in education. Even the US isn't rich enough to allow people not to work. Some day we will be but until then things like the Earned Income Tax Credit will help increase the demand for labor.
I'm responding to you so that I can be higher than the guy talking about Bill Gates exploiting people. 
I am not sure if Steam here means the gaming platform or adding Arts to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. I have always been a big STEM fan but I have nothing against either STEAM.
I'd love to see this answered.
 I know he's said in the past that he has no interest in being President, but we *desperately* need a science minded President.  If we're going to start electing businessmen to the Presidency again, I'd at least like one like Bill Gates, who is forward thinking, pragmatic, and best of all, compassionate. I'd be honored to vote for the man, personally.
This is what I want to know too :)
Just look them straight in the eye and say "I can't read".
IIRC Microsoft at one time owned a good portion of Apple.  They might still own some amount.  That probably counts :P

Get off of Reddit and do it.
I hope his administration will decide that funding R&D to invent the next generation of energy (clean, cheap, reliable) is a good deal for the US and for the world. Climate change requires cooperation between countries over a period of decades but we don't have much time to waste.
There are so many great TV shows now I can't keep up.I thought someone might ask specifically about Silicon Valley which I love. I can relate to Richard.Silicon Valley captures a lot of how crazy it is to start a new company and the dynamics of success. All the employees of Pied Piper remind me of people I have known.I love This is Us, The Crown, The Knick, Homeland, Downton Abbey, ...
Windows ME, of course!
I can't believe that actually works. We all made fun of Marvel movies for using this as a disguise but here we are.
It's edge now you heretic
Wow, it's like we're the same person with just 60 billion small differences.
I really needed to hear this right now. 
Pls bring aus better internet.
> Hopefully a grandfatherNO PRESSURE GATES KIDS
Just wanted to reply to say that I love you Bill 
Sure you can. My employer is buying my time right now.Edit; got some interesting feedback from this one. I'd like to add a quote I like, for your enjoyment.If you don't build your own dream, someone will hire you to build theirs.-Michael scott
What are you most curious about, Bill?
two pepsi one chip
wow i just awwd at bill gates 
It's pretty sad that in an age of technology and communications such as ours that one of our biggest and growing issues is the disconnect we have with each other.  
Bill Gates reads the Economist too. I feel so smart now. lol
TIL I've been playing tennis wrong
I still do this and I'm in med school. Long hours of war have inspired me to fix the people war kills
TIL polio is still a thing.
Lots of dope shit
> the people who create the first strong AI have the right valuesHow could you make sure this happens? Also, it's quite theoretical to assume that nobody with bad motivations would gain control over it afterwards.I think it's idealistic but unrealistic to think that *if* true AI ever exists, there is even a slight possibility of it **not** being massively misused. Take a look at history, that's what always happens
> IE <= this is bad.FTFYj/k Bill
Because it'd be making a political statement more or less
One could say you both *Xeroxed* the idea.
"Well, Steve, I think there's more than one way of looking at it. I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it."
Reminds me of when /u/neiltyson explained that in order to justify Bill Gates stopping to pick up money on the street, it would need to be at least $45,000. Otherwise, it's not worth his time.
You must be new here.
So after a couple of years in college. What will you say if he wants to drop out to pursue some crazy dream of starting his own company?
>  Some day we will beAnd then what? I'm genuinely curious about what our society will look like and whether or not people are already actively preparing for or thinking about it, because it will cause a change like we've never seen before over the course of history.
Indeed, I hope that he is able to sift through the comments section to see this. It could change millions of lives, and that is what his foundation is all about.
Also tagging u/thisisbillgates
Bill Gates loves Steam confirmed. Still a PC person.
Interestingly Bill Gates was despised through the 90's for what many considered his monopoly on OS's. Reddit in the 90's would not have been very kind to Bill Gates. 
It might be weird having a president who was a successful businessman
Silicon Valley! I love that! It has inspired me to consider pursuing a career in developing! Can you give me some tips?
Everyone notices it's Superman, but they're too polite to point it out. 
Well it was IE for the whole Gates era, he had nothing to do with Edge so I think it's ok
I think you meant 86 billions small differences.
> We are all indebted to youEh we all made him the richest guy in the world. Let's call it even. 
I'm not sure which part resonated with you, but what Bill said reminds me of the movie *It's a Wonderful Life*. The incription in the Tom Sawyer book that Clarence leaves for George says, "Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends."
Keep in mind the closest people to you is yourself.
You mean Obama and Biden are Gates-Buffet level bros?
I am SO happy you made this analogy. I can't count the number of times I begged my acquaintances to stop treating the election like it was the Super Bowl.
I think, if we really want to promote critical thinking, we need to teach it divorced from present real world politics. Because it's *always* been Partisan BS in my experience.
It's bad enough when parents at it out loud to a few friends but.. Gates kids, meet Reddit.
Well, you were kinda right.
how did you pass CAPTCHA if you're a computer ?checkmate, "computer".
1. People are idiots.2. They don't even know HOW stupid they are since the Gates' have already pledged to donate their entire fortune to charity when they pass.I believe their children will get a very modest inheritance (very modest by billionaire standards) and the rest goes to the foundation to improve the lives of people for years to come.Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are the Carnegie's of this generation. Buffet has already given over 30 BILLION dollars to charity, and Gates will give that much or more by the time he's 'done'.Amazing people.
Money well spent I see. 
excellent question, dick-nipples
As if Bill Gates doesn't know what a first world problem is. He's just smart enough to not answer the question while answering the question and endearing himself to people at the same time.
I had a friend whose goats they used to clear the brush on their property were stolen. I couldn't figure out if that was a First or Third World problem.
Tbf I connect with a lot of people (especially here), but I just don't know who y'all are.
You both read Reddit as well
I can see this going very poorly. Stools are not very stable, and many people are terrible at jumping. Broken legs/arms/collarbones.... 
Actually no I still have the game and play it occasionally though most of my time is spent on games like CKII, CIV V/VI, and EU4
Yep, I've been waiting for AoEIV ever since the infamous instruction manual pic...
No thanks, I prefer Windows 7.
Oww, the Edge
Goddamn that was good
Anyone who is still seriously trash talking in their 60s needs to grow up. 
Whilst it offers an interesting perspective, those kinds of calculations assume that Bill Gates stopping to pick up money somehow makes his corporate earnings drop by 45k. The truth is that his constant attention isn't necessary for Microsoft to continue generating profits.
"Here's a small loan of a million dollars..."Actually I would love for that to be the case.  
I know what it is:  Why are PCs like air conditioners?They stop working properly if you open Windows!
Most people will probably look like me.  Sit around at home eating doritos, smoking weed and jerking off.  It's a simple life, but a satisfying one.
> We don't need this PR-shitMaybe he IS running for president!
Yes, definitely after he signed off. 
Half Life 3 confirmed!
He did work at microsoft before founding Valve...
I mean yeah that's the beauty of the human condition-- we can improve.
Wow. So instead of communicating like normal people, we need a doublespeak manual to pass a job interview now.
Talk less. 
I've always found it wise not to insult the intelligence of a man with eyes that can destroy you with a single look.
lol yeah who wants to be in bed with bill gates with a bunch of guys hahaha that would be super silly. lol tho if this actually is happening let me know just cause of how silly it would be lol
I can't tell with their hats on
That's actually Gill Bates.
And IE still ships along with edge...
Maybe that guy has 26 billion dollars
Yeah Bill, hook us up.
Same to you man! 
This may have been the greatest thing i have read in some time. Not sure why, it just really spoke to me. Thanks man. 
Maybe teach it for foreign historical politics? I.e if you're in the US, no way you're gonna manage to implement a non-biased history class on 20th century world politics or US history, but it might be easier if it's learning about some feudal kingdoms or Classical Empires (lots of juicy political drama in the Greek and Roman political histories). You wouldn't expect some kid/teacher to have a prior bias on whether Vercingetorix was right in his rebellion or not.Also yeah of course if you try and do it with present politics, it's not going to work.
idk it'd definitely gotten better, but still enough errors that i don't really bother with it most of the time.
I mean, I rarely ever get them on the first try. Maybe I'm just brute forcing them. 
I remember when I was growing up, Bill Gates was the villain. Times sure have changed.
Ohhhhh shit
*snaps* yes!
Quit ruining the illusion. 
I feel smarter now too
Did somebody say, broken arms?
>CKIIMy man.
Oh yeah. IV, V, VI. There was Rise of Nations though.
In my subjective experience, I have more nostalgia for AoE2 as that's what I played when I was a kid, and AoE3 introduces fairly fundamental differences in game mechanics to the previous two iterations. I enjoy AoE3 in and of itself, but it doesn't FEEL like AoE2 or the original AoE. 
Just a reminder that neither Bill Gates, or Elon Musk, or whoever isn't a god. We shouldn't blindly agree with everything someone says, even if 90% of the time they're correct.
It's interesting that we have videos that can play on thousands of different devices using hundreds of different video players, but medical records have yet to be standardized in any way. 
Especially if you've basically 'won' at the game of life with regards to wealth.
I believe the calculations actually show that the 45k is roughly  equivalent to your average person stopping to pick up a penny and that's why it isn't worth his time. An average persons earnings won't be reduced by a penny to pick up a penny but it's still probably not worth the time and effort.
I'm sure Bill's kid would do many great things with that small loan. 
I've always heard it as "too many windows".

Until they came out with that CAPTCHA that is just a check mark. I tend to get it most of the time now
Yup, that's a good point.
The whole hero worship of Steve Jobs and shitting on Bill Gates thing has never made any sense to me. People are weird.

Hey now let's not get ahead of ourselves 
Fucking shit
>My GlitterhoofFTFY
Then there's uneducated slobs like myself who have never played AoE2 and skipped straight from AoE to AoE3 so AoE2 just doesn't do much for me.
The problem is money. Not that the EMR companies don't make enough of it, but there is no financial incentive to make it "better". Most of the "enterprise" and "medical" grade software is this way.  
I bing stuff on Google.
Dark Souls is a pretty shitty console port on Windows, requiring third-party mods to even properly work in a lot of cases. Seeing that mess run through another layer of fuckery on a Mac would be glorious.

There's also no money in standardizing.If the formats are different, the vendors can sell you adapters.

A 9 Year Old.
Moscow is the biggest city in Europe. A lot of people forget that. Shy of Tokyo, it's the biggest city I've ever lived in. I'd rather be home, but it's a lot like any other major city.
Whistleblower protection laws, a strong defense of the right for someone charged with political crimes to make any defense they want (currently in the US, someone charged with revealing classified information is entirely prohibited from arguing before the jury that the programs were unlawful, immoral, or otherwise wrongful), and support for the development of technically and legally protected means of communications between sources and journalists.The sad truth is that societies that demand whistleblowers be martyrs often find themselves without either, and always when it matters the most.
Thanks for the kind words. I definitely consider myself ajournalist, as well as an artist and a filmmaker. In my mind, it's not aquestion about whether I am one or the other. Documentary films needs to do more than journalism - they need to communicate something that is more universal.
Thank so much Miss Poitras! We are all proud of you! Cheers!
This was a quality AMA. Come back soon!
Yes, I do plan to release more footage from Hong Kong shoot. On the first day we met Ed, Glenn conducted a long interview (4-5 hours) that is extraordinary. I also conducted a separate interview with Ed re: technical questions. The time constraints of a feature film made it impossible to include everything. I will release more.  I also filmed incredible footage with Julian Assange/WikiLeaks that we realized in the edit room was a separate film.
Thank you for asking. My main question for Mr. Snowden is a technical one. How did you get so many questions planted in your AMA so effectively? With my presidential resources I was only able to get about a dozen questions prepared in advance and upvoted in my AMA along with my canned answers. (There are only so many interns in the White House.) You must be utilizing Russian intel to manipulate reddit so effectively. How do you do it? Tell me and I'll knock 3 months off your supermax prison life sentence. Thanks in advance. -B
/u/falcon4287 have you considered the implications for your friend if he were known by his employer to have said something significantly different from what he's told you?
One of the biggest problems in governance today is the difficulty faced by citizens looking to hold officials to account when they cross the line. We can develop new tools and traditions to protect our rights, and we can do our best to elect new and better representatives, but if we cannot enforce consequences on powerful officials for abusive behavior, we end up in a system where the incentives reward bad behavior post-election. That's how we end up with candidates who say one thing but, once in power, do something radically different. How do you fix that? Good question.
Hey guys, sorry -- the reddit mods are being a little weird. My account is /u/SuddenlySnowden. Mods: Can you pull back the ban?  I can't post from the primary account. Thanks.
I don't have a commercial interest in the film, so I can't speak for the filmmakers, but I know what it's like to be a student with no money.
Given the fact that I had been repeatedly detained at the U.S. border because of my work on previous films, I moved to Berlin to edit Citizenfour. When Ed contacted me in early 2013 I gave him my assurance I would never comply with a subpoena. Before going to Hong Kong I met with many lawyers to assess the risk. I ignored some of the warnings - for instance the Washington Post urged me not to travel to Hong Kong. Another lawyer said not to bring my camera. In the end I decided I could not live with the decision to not travel to Hong Kong. 
Probably went to the bathroom. Makes running easier.
Thanks. The film will be out on DVD sometime in the summer, but we're still working on the exact date. 
Is winter harsh? Do you ever want to go out, but wake up and find yourself suddenly snowed in?
Last comrade in Motherland sat alone in room. There was knock on door. Was KGB. KGB is forever.
After Watergate and the Pentagon Papers, why aren't whistleblower protection laws yet implemented? Or is the whistleblower protection act something else?
"NSA, who have you spied on?""Yes"
If i remember correctly Glenn said it himself on twitter and then redacted it saying they needed more time. Nothing ended up happening. 
Your shot choices in CitizenFour were beautiful, as someone who has done run and gun coverage before, your super wide choices and long takes on establishing shots w/ audio editing beneath felt like a new way to grab footage and represent it without slapping something ugly down on the timeline in order to simply inform
He's karmanaut!
Oh man, I would absolutely love to see the whole, raw footage you shot. It was very interesting to see how things unfolded before the world knew a whole lot about who had leaked things.Is this separate film with Assange in production currently?
This man's a phony. The real president would use "-Barry O" as his signature.
Come on. Can't we just talk about Rampart?
I completely understand him not wanting to say something over the phone... but when I brought up Edward Snowden, his defensiveness about the subject was not "feeding me the company line," he was genuinely upset about what Snowden did and was angrily calling him a traitor.  Given that it was the day before the guy's wedding, I didn't want to get into it with him by mentioning my views that Snowden is a national hero. He was already irate at the mere mention of Snowden's name. That's far from just telling me what he's "supposed to" say. He genuinely believed what he was saying.
Yeah but it makes for a good netflix show.
Mod here - really sorry for the confusion. Your colleagues set up the OPs account for you and when you started replying on a different account we had to assume it was a fake.Your new account /u/SuddenlySnowden is good to go.
"Not dieing in a secret American prison" has to be up there as well.
Why do you think Obama had been so aggressively jailing whistleblowers and censoring journalists? If I recall correctly, he stated whistleblowers were essential to democracy (I'm paraphrasing). Was his earlier attitude simply pandering to his base? 
And then you get painted by the American media as a rapist and sex offender through their common character assassination plots.
You should put it on Netflix ASAP though. More people will watch it that way as well.
Much better than the ones asking how the food is in Moscow or how cold the winters are.
Best decision ever.On a more personal level (family etc.) how has life changed after your documentaries?
Canada, Sweden and North Dakota have pretty harsh winters, too. As does Boston.
It is very realistic that in the realpolitik of great powers, this kind of thing could happen. I don't like to think that it would happen, but it certainly could. At the same time, I'm so incredibly blessed to have had an opportunity to give so much back to the people and internet that I love. I acted in accordance with my conscience and in so doing have enjoyed far more luck than any one person can ask for. If that luck should run out sooner rather than later, on balance I will still - and always - be satisfied.
Nice try, agent hollowx.

You are doing that too much!  Try again in 9 minutes.=== === Reddit Censorship!If someone buys you Reddit Gold, does the 9-minute limit go away?
It takes a ton of time to read through and understand a truckload of classified documents.
Also because 'wrong' and 'illegal' are sometimes not the same thing. Snowden would be tried on the legality of his actions, not the morality.
It's okay if they argue back, that means they are listening. You just continue to refute their argument. Most people won't be persuaded immediately and won't revert their position that they have held for years on the spot even if they know they are wrong.but it will sink in and they will think about the argument. They might even change their minds just not immediately.
    function hasNSAWiretap(citizen) {      return true;    }
While true, once people see their names on this list, they will never forgot that it is happening.  It no longer becomes "I have nothing to hide" when you know *definitively* that somebody is spying on you.
Yup, thinking about Bill C-51 as I read that.
/u/A_WILD_SLUT_APPEARS in the federal government...
I think more than voting third party, we need to change our vote system to the alternate vote.  Meaning you rank your favorites. If your first vote doesn't get any votes at all, but your second vote was for someone who had a chance, then your second vote would go towards the election.   That way the third party doesn't take away from the main party that most agrees with your beliefs. Because unfortunately, right now a vote for a third part is essentially a vote for one of the major parties.

Can imagine the call. Hello Mr. Putin, could you please put our new president on a plane and send him to us?
Dude that "where would we be if the British crown had perfect surveillance and could have locked up the founding fathers" argument is probably the most succinct and impactful demonstration of why surveillance is bad that I have ever heard. I think it will most successfully break through to people who are stuck in the "I have nothing to hide" mindset. Because it raises the question, "Yes, but what if you DID have something to hide, not because you're a criminal, but because your government is?" 
Considering so much of the current overreach started with the previous administration, and Cruz has nothing but good things to say about them, I think your point stands.
By voting in the primaries for the guys who talk about it.

It is. Cognitive dissonance is no shit.
He's like a cyber buddha
I have the impression that a lot of NSA people think they are doing a great thing for protecting the country, defending US interests.And to a certain point, they are right. They just don't realize that at the same time, they're destroying everything the US prides itself about (individual freedoms, democracy, ...).
You got gilded in 30 seconds. Wtf?
You hit an average unprecedented in any AMA of 2 replies per question. This is a big day for you.
Thanks! Feel free to prune this part of the thread.
Isn't it supposed to be dying? Nevermind.

It's like Stephen Harper is living ten years in the past, watching the Bush era and saying "Wow! That's brilliant! EVERYONE will LOVE that if we do it in Canada!"
It's depressing to see that both major parties support it, so it's likely to get through (Aussie here).
Yup. With the current voting system, a two party system is statistically guaranteed. If you managed to get another party in, it would simply displace one of the existing two parties.
It will be recommended reading for my Debate course. My graduating seniors will be given a  copy of Walden and Civil Disobedience as a graduation gift.  
That's why they shoot great people like him.
I have a feeling this isn't your only account. 
Agree... it's just tough to get people motivated when they aren't seeing the impact right in front of their faces. With most successful movements that I can think of, the boot was felt on millions of necks to a point it interfered with their lives.
Now all of reddit has to vote for Snowden.Snowden 2016
> "Yes, but what if you DID have something to hide, not because you're a criminal, but because your government is?" That's something. I've never thought about that from that perspective.
And by making it THE campaign issue. It's important that voters know where the candidates stand. Safe to say Hillary and Jeb are pro spying on Americans. Let's make them say it publically over and over again. 
Young folks and minorities...yep, that's who votes...
See step 4 please
That won't happen without fundamentally altering human psychology. The only thing separating clickbait from yellow journalism is technology and a screen - it's been around for as long as mass media has
"I think the dankest meme is the gnome one..."
NSA: "Don't go to Snowden's AMA! Look over here, look at all these dank memes!"
You absolutely have to believe in what you're doing. It's not a matter of being paid enough to quiet the moral voice inside you, it's that you believe that national security and America's interests should be pursued and protected by pretty much whatever means necessary. These agencies look very closely at candidates and try their best to discern whether or not they fit that profile. 
Gilded himself.
Did Edward Snowden just encourage censorship?! Of course that was satirical
To also contribute:It has not only changed how I see things, but also people around me, who are not technically inclined.For example: The revelations /u/SuddenlySnowden made my parents and my sibings really aware of the issue.They actually asked me to help them set up some encryption stuff - which works like a charm ever since
I'm going to use this when someone says something stupid.
Time to sue Metallica.
In Soviet Russia, joke kills you.
Hate to say it.  We're behind him only from the comfort of our couches.  Snowden's fate would be the same as Pvt Manning or worse.
The only thing sweeter than sweet, sweet karma, is that sweet, sweet irony.

It's not just Harper.  Trudeau is supporting the bill and says he'll change it a bit to add oversight once he's elected, but oversight has proven useless at stopping these violations everywhere else and it's doubtful that he would do it anyways.The Liberal Party has always been just as bad and probably worse on privacy issues.  
Probably because if Abbott shoves his diplomatic dildo any further up his own ass even Joe Hockey will be seriously considering bombing parliament just to put everyone out of their misery.

my point is that he is expanding the base.  he also appeals to the traditional GOP fiscal conservative base that is for lower taxes, less regulation, etc.  where he is arguably weaker within the GOP is in his social conservatism, but i see that as a strength in a national election.
Alright, who wants to post this to /r/WritingPrompts?

A friendly reminder that the NDP is taking a hard stance (so far) against the bill. Honestly I was pretty surprised that the Liberals aren't, and if I had been considering voting for them this time around anyway this would have instantly changed that.
Take it easy mate, didn't you see how many flags he had behind him the other day?

What if he's submitted to /r/gonewild?
Hi NSA! Do you like dank memes?
Can confirm. Snowden Intelligence > Intelligence of World PowersI'm not sure if this is cool or depressing.
I know, it's pretty cool. I wonder how many other celebrities use reddit under a different username.
I'm on the couch for now but rest assured that if something tragic happens to my family, I will become Liam Neeson, Nick Cage, and Batman all in one and my life will become an Uwe Bolle movie.

Huge issue for me because I feel my vote goes to waste living in Oklahoma most of the time.
As the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, I share your concern very deeply. The recently-passed Republican budget makes massive cuts in almost every governmental agency, including those engaged in our scientific research. This is a disaster. If we are going to address the major health issues facing our society -- Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, etc. -- we need to invest more in research and develop the best research centers in the world.
My first effort would be to rally the American people to demand that Congress pass a progressive agenda which reverses the decline of our middle class. We have got to create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, we've got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, we've got to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and we have to transform our energy system in order to protect us from climate change. If the American people are politically active and demand that Congress act on their behalf, we can accomplish those goals and much more.
I voted against the USA Patriot Act and voted against reauthorizing the USA Patriot Act. Obviously, terrorism is a serious threat to this country and we must do everything that we can to prevent attacks here and around the world. I believe strongly that we can protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights and I worry very very much about the huge attacks on privacy that we have seen in recent years -- both from the government and from the private sector. I worry that we are moving toward an Orwellian society and this is something I will oppose as vigorously as I can.
I voted against the war in Iraq and I voted against the first Gulf War. I am strongly opposed to sending American combat troops into Iraq and Syria. At the end of the day, the war against ISIS will only be won when the Muslim countries in the area fully engage and defeat ISIS and other groups that are distorting what Islam is supposed to be about. The United States and other western countries should be supportive of the efforts of those governments, but cannot lead them. The nightmare, which I believe a number of Republicans want to see, is perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East.
Someone should get on this. Bernie needs those small or big ;) donations. 
Sanders as opposed to Obama has a record to support his claim that he is not the status quo. This doesn't mean things will be different if he is elected. The president isn't a king.
Volunteer!  Once the campaign opens up field offices in your area, they can give you a list of likely voters for you to contact (by phone or at the door).  Studies show that a good conversation with a voter makes them significantly more likely to pay attention to your candidate and show up on election day.
As somebody who has consistently voted to end discrimination in all forms -- who voted against DOMA way back in the 1990s -- I will do all that I can to continue our efforts to make this a nondiscriminatory society, whether those being discriminated against are transgender, gay, black or Hispanic.
Hope he answers this. I support his policies, but I'd like to see him answer some questions from conservatives. 
He's going to avoid talking about guns  completely, which probably is smart. He already has far left voters probably, but if he wants center votes he can't hate on guns.
And not just space exploration, but also the vital role they play in monitoring climate conditions.
In OK, 1,600,000 eligible voters didn't show up to the polls in the 2012 election. Republicans won the state by 440,000. It might seem hopeless; it might be a long shot, but vote anyway. If enough people decide voting is important, maybe next time the election is only lost by 100,000...then 10,000...then people see it as important and you change the system. The only time your vote doesn't count is when you don't cast it.
Is it really true that dollar for dollar, we get more energy out of solar wind and geothermal than nuclear? Seems too good to be true. Does anyone have a citation on that? Or is he just saying that the investment is more cost effective down the road?
A lot of your answers depend on rallying the American people to previously unseen levels of political participation and activism.In the case that that remarkable transformation did not occur, what would you still expect to achieve as President?
Funny how by voting against the Patriot Act, you are more of a patriot than if you would vote *for* it. Nice going senator.
If only some president would have warned us about the increasing influence of the military industry in Congress.
Do you think we should have a similarly large military presence globally, but focus more on community building, or scaling back our presence entirely?
Thank you as a college student
I DIBS IT WAS A REPLY TO MY QUESTION
He's AMA'd before.
Whelp, you actually answered the non-PR-friendly question.  This puts you way ahead of most of the AMAs around here.
Agreed. As a young person I really wish our country had just one "front" to be united on. My dad describes the JFK Space Race years as pretty magical.
He's also said that his litmus test for SCOTUS justices would be their opinion on Citizen's United. So even if a constitutional amendment is out of reach, it could still be overturned by a later court.
> Our police had more important things to do.That's really the most important take-away from this answer.
Right - unless you're in bed with the corporate interests that he so staunchly is against. So for Bernie, in particular, there's no reason to oppose legalization. 
I fully expected you to be extremely selective with what you'd answer in this AMA. It's awesome seeing how real you are at answering all these questions.
Transparency is a principle of his to say the least
Conservatives need to be honest and conciliatory about our defense budget. We can't just keep writing the Pentagon a blank check.  There are conservatives out there who have articulated this position. 
I agree, but I'd still like to know his thoughts on the matter.  I figured there's no better place to get this information than right here so what the hell?  Can't hurt to ask.Also, avoiding questions because the issue is polarizing and the answer might alienate someone is about the oldest political response in the book.  Even if he doesn't see or answer this question, his work thusfar has indicated that we can expect better from him.
he's been given an F from the NRA, but is a career senator for a progressive state with arguably the loosest gun laws in the country.  I would be disappointed if he dodged this issue the entire campaign
Ehh... he doesn't advocate for collective ownership of the means of production. He's more of a social democrat. 
Don't do this. I like Bernie but joining a subreddit that blatantly supports him isn't a good idea if you want to form an unbiased opinion on all of the candidates. 
Yeah it is.  I live in a Democratic district in Maryland.  A district gerrymandered to get a Republican out of office.  It's not a Republican or Democrat or Whig phenomenon.
Even if "your vote doesn't count" it actually does when versed in such large numbers. 
No, it's not. Not with current technology levels. The other issue is space. It takes a lot less space to make a lot more power from a nuclear plant that from solar or wind farms.
I could be wrong, but I believe that since Nuclear is such a large capital investment there's a fair chance that a similar investment into renewables could be more useful in the long term.
If Bernie can't make that remarkable transformation happen, he's not gonna be president. The ONLY way we can get him elected is if large groups of us start actively participating in government.
This shouldn't be news at this point, but they name these things like that on purpose.  Calling a bill that digs into constitutional protections the "patriot act" was very much by design.
Or maybe if a President had warned us about foreign entanglements in general, and told us to stick to solving domestic problems. You know, like maybe the very first President.
> My strong belief is that it is imperative that we maintain our vision of what American can be, and that we fight hard to make that happen. DO NOT GIVE UP.I think I just felt my heart start waving an American flag. Beautiful reminder to cynical old me.
serious question, if we want to focus more on community building, is that really a job for the military?  Wouldn't there be organizations that are designed specifically for this we could send instead?  No matter how kind our troops are, most locals would be off-put by people carrying assault rifles around them.
Gotta be careful with these kinds of answers though.  Obama ran with a campaign promise of giving free tuition/cutting it drastically (can't remember which atm) based on students doing so many hours of community service per year.  Didn't hear a word about that after the election.
He's going to need a lot of people talking about him and spreading his ideas around. I basically asked all of my family, coworkers, and friends what they think about him and basically no one really knows about him yet unfortunately.
I'm sure he's gotten in trouble before for that one, entitled is a hot-button word. You're right. I hope someone on his campaign reads that. I might also suggest using "deserves" in place of "is entitled to" in his answer. >But, if we can develop a strong grassroots movement which says that every man, woman and child in this country deserves a minimum standard of living -- deserves health care, deserves education, deserves housing -- then we can succeedI also like 'deserve' in this case because it implies people are worthy of these services rather than  'entitlements.'
Well you can look at it this way, if he becomes president, there'll be one less person in the Senate voting for budget cuts to NASA.
The people who are giving him gold are probably *also* donating to his campaign. 
I second this, Senator. I feel you tiptoed around the question. Is an elaboration possible?
>> Be on the lookoutWhere should we be looking?
Yeah that's pretty much exactly what I think too. We don't even have enough drug rehab/therapy for non-criminals in this country, let alone everyone we deem to be criminals.
they also shouldn't be allowed to ban candidates from debating anywhere else, otherwise they get banned from the dnc debates, and yet they have done exactly that. 
> I'm going to watch very closely to see the pluses and minuses of what they have done. I will have more to say about this issue within the coming months.For me, *this* is the most important takeaway.  He will gather evidence and revisit his position once he examines it.  It seems so simple, yet so few politicians ever take a rational, data-driven approach.
When you compare recreational cannabis to the other issues that he is fighting for, it is more than reasonable to focus energy elsewhere, especially when the movement already has so much traction. Agreed.
> Why don't we do that on a national scale?Cause we've invested to much money in private prisons and the war on drugs. Most politicians don't want to take a stand and admit an error so they just keep the status quo and kick the can down the street. 
I believe you do.  I prescribe more cowbell.
I haven't followed Bernie's political career for very long but the one thing that I noticed right away is that he answers questions directly, and often bluntly, without dancing around the topic and playing political double-speak games. Ask Bernie a question and you'll get a straight answer.
It's too bad that questions such as these are considered 'hard ball'...
It does require sufficient transmission to get nuclear power distributed as well, which is quite costly, and slow to get sited. There are tradeoffs to both which require a lot of thought. 
I don't think /u/ImPinkSnail was arguing that. A large investment in renewables now will potentially make them more viable sooner, but it's still a question of time. Good reliable renewable energy that can be transported to where it's needed is still not practical and will likely still take several decades at least. Nuclear is really the best option in the interim.
> is nuclear energy better than coal or other fossil-fuel alternatives?Yes, it objectively is.
We need to start outvoting our grandparents.
Yep. It's like the pro-life/pro-choice debate. By opposing one side, you're suddenly "against life" or you "don't like choice."Similarly, if the general public hears a senator is against something called the "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act?" Obviously, they want the terrorists to win and will have bad PR for a bit.
To be fair, Washington lived at a time when foreign affairs had far fewer and smaller effects on the country. I don't think his isolationist approach is quite as practical now as it was then.
There's a campaign slogan in there somewhere.
They don't need to wear the same uniform or undergo the same training.  What is important is that you provide the same goverenmental resources and personnel, repurposed away from violence toward revitalizing.
The difference between Obama and Sanders though is that this isn't just a campaign promise. It's an ideal he's been working toward for years. He's not saying it because he hopes it'll earn him votes; he's saying it because it's sound policy. And unlike Obama, Sanders won't be bought out by large corporations telling him, "Nah, we don't wanna pay for everyone's college."Obama had to worry about a second term. I don't think Bernie has that interest. He wants to get in, get as much shit done as possible, and let the 2020 candidate worry about 8 years.
Fill them in! Every person I know who will listen is now voting for sanders. We need you to do the same! Everyone needs to pitch in or we lose hands down. This isnt an election, were attempting revolution.
Came here for this. Linguistics is important. I use "deserve" every time I talk about "basic human dignities".
It might not be that he wanted to vote against NASA, but that he really thought the funds were needed elsewhere. 
What if his whole campaign was a ploy to get Reddit Gold?
People with service/lower wage jobs don't get weekends/holidays off.
He means people have to vote for more than just him.  It's the congressmen, represenatives, governers that have to be behind him as well.
I was just about to ask, "What's stopping them from having non-DNC debates? Why can't reddit host a debate?"Thanks for answering me prematurely!
I agree for recreational legalization. However, decriminalization is HUGE. It's one of the biggest ways that our country creates gaps between race and achievement, fills our prisons (and prison owners') pockets, takes tons of taxpayer money and police time away from things that matter, and also create opposition between otherwise productive citizens and police. Decriminalization is one of the biggest high-impact issues Bernie could (reasonably) address in my opinion. 
Dudes a champ.
You could have it listed in the ingredients. INGREDIENTS: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup made from genetically modified corn^11. short description or name of the strain or modified gene on the footnote.
Economically I can see why you would say so, as something like universal Medicare is tantamount to the antithesis of Libertarian economical policy, but the social issues I would think Libertarians identify with. After all, less government regulation on what you can and can't do as well as reduced intervention seems to be in line with Libertarian ideals. 
Vermonter as well. Everyone is Vermont knows him, and I have never met someone who didn't like him though. And I live in Barre (reference for Vermonters).
Also has there been enough nuclear dismantling to really get the number for nuclear?Creating the plants always go overbudget. Dismantling always goes overbudget. Taking care of waste is also costly and there's no real solution for it.
And we need to start in the Primaries
I'm a big fan of voting by mail to get the registered voters to vote. It works great in OR and WA, I love it. 
or "citizens united".their entire wording is the exact opposite of what they do.
Because he knows that if he gets in and gets shit done, the people who like what he did the first time around will vote for him again.
Yeah, that's how policy makers get their bills through. Want to deregulate the banks, attach it to a bill that targets sex offenders. If anyone votes against it, they are pro-sex offenders.  That why Bill Clinton had it nice. Line item veto was the shit. I think the benefit of it far out weights the downsides. Would prefer if the line item veto could be overturned with a simple majority though. That way its truly more fair. 
The way these riders work is pretty obnoxious - you could be fully in support of a bill to outlaw kicking kittens, only to have someone add a rider to exterminate those pesky unicorns.  Either way you vote, it becomes an attack ad in the next election cycle.
That's pretty much exactly what he said.
/u/kile8998 your coffee is ready
Or hospital workers!
Same with washington state. It was the first time I ever voted when I moved there because it was the first time I was able to. I just came home one day with a ballot of federal, state, and local things to vote on, put it back in the mail the next morning on the way to work and that was it, I voted! It was so insanely easy and with precedent in other states it wouldn't be to difficult for any state to start implementing.
Yes - and if it could be wrapped into/around a civic holiday like the 4th of July then that would be even better.  We need parades and fireworks associated with voting and your civic duty.  We need electoral participation associated with pride in the country.
The more big money loses, you mean. Let's not make this a partisan issue.
I have posted this guide high and low because I want to make sure that everybody who wants to vote for Bernie gets to vote for Bernie. No cruel tricks; no rude surprises.
My general opinion is that I'd be much more OK with that than a general warning. 
Who you calling nobody, chump? 
Iowan here. Looking into caucusing. 
"Operation Iraqi Freedom" I think you're on to something...
I'd like to think that he actually wants our country to do better.  Saddling people with huge debt hampers our citizens and potential small business owners with a massive burden that'll keep them from achieving their full potential.
Not even that. Senators will negotiate by saying "If you support my bill to defund NASA I will support your bill to feed hungry children. You will accept this deal because without my vote your bill wont pass."
Right, the point is that Sanders would've been 1 vote in 100, on a bill that would likely have done dozens or hundreds of things *in addition* to cutting some funding from NASA.Hell, without context, this could simply have been, "You voted for federal budgets that cut NASA's funding over previous years." The federal budget is a very complicated document, and I doubt there are any elected officials who are completely satisfied with the budget they ultimately vote for.
"Why does Bernie Sanders hate unicorns?"
Wouldn't hospital workers still have to work on national holidays?
This is why we need Election **Week**.
Open for a few hours in the afternoon while you're at work. Or, you can wait 2 hours on Saturday. That's how it was in Ohio last presidential election.
This^^^ The Clinton foundation's major donors are the same reptilians who donate to the Republican super pacs. 
That damn Iowa caucus. Please do participate, it's an incredibly important one.
A five star general, a Supreme Commander of Allied forces in Europe, who became President, and subsequently retired to the family farm leaving a warning that the Military Industrial Complex made him fearful of the future of the United States.  Definitely an interesting person.
Because the USSR had the bomb and it was game on.
And Teddy Roosevelt (republican) was a nature loving large business hating man. Also Don't forget that the "Democrats" were the party of slavery, The trail of tears, and through FDR's new deal spread legal housing segregation to the north. Parties change with time.
>unless by some act of God his first term goes so incredibly well that a second term is inevitable.One can hope.
See, I'm actually more okay with that when done in good faith. This is technically compromising and politics can't really exist without a bit of this. Everyone has their agenda's (with good or bad intentions behind them) and in order for them to be made into policy, you need to make a few trades. I much prefer this form of politics over the blackmail politics I was talking about in the parent comment. 
Yeah, that's why I always get an absentee ballot. 12 hour shifts with a 30 minute break if I'm lucky. I'm better off just mailing it in. I've actually never been to a voting booth, now that I think of it. 
Must be tiny right? I live in Des Moines so I'm no expert but didn't planting just take place?
And as a man who understood and witnessed the dangers of escalation, he actively sought to draw down the conflict with the Soviet Union. The Interstate Highway System essentially came from funds he took away from military expenditure.
His farewell address was completely uncharacteristic of him. I think there was some regret in it.
Are you from the kyle8999 Gaming Forums?
Whoah. It's like when we apply critical sense and common sense to a problem, things work better.
This. I voted in every election, minor or not, when I lived in Oregon. Since I moved away, it's now a major decision to take time off and go to a polling place. National vote-by-mail would be the single most effective thing I can think of to increase voter participation.
Haha yes, most farmers are done with corn by now so maybe some of the stuff 2 weeks ago is popping up but beans are just getting planted. I'm in western Iowa where its been raining a bunch so its just been a waiting game for this mud to go away :P
Some Republicans tried to get rid of net neutrality with the "Internet Freedom Act."
A lot of people want to live in Vermont. They get driven out by the weather (mud season is hard to take), by the lack of well paid jobs, and by the inconvenience of life here. Still, if you can make it through three or four years, you won't want to leave. Just prepare to take a lot of your compensation from clean air, clean water, low crime and civility. You have to give up the toys, though.
Very good question.I have to say, scrambled.Over a slice of sourdough bread that has been grilled, and then sort of doused with Worcestershire sauce.Now scrambled eggs, I did a video a few years back with my youngest, Tilly, showing how to make scrambled eggs, and I think it has 10-11 million hits?And the nice thing about scrambled eggs is that they don't have to just be breakfast - you can have them in the evening, with some nice mushrooms, some tomatoes. You can have them as a snack at midnight, or at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. 
I had an amazing doubled pork chop with rhubarb. Now rhubarb is something we literally eat with desserts, but this dish was incredible. It was in Spain. It was a double pork-chop that had been slow-roasted over an open pit fire with rhubarb. Absolutely delicious. This was one of my mates that was trying to show off cooking in his back garden in Spain when we were out filming for KITCHEN NIGHTMARES. I didn't think it was going to work, to be honest.And then when I started tasting, I thought *Shit! This is delicious!* 
Sauces from a jar, if you've been watching this season of HK
That's a really good question.I would recommend that you get adventurous with pulses - chickpeas, beans, lentils. And you know, cooking these is incredible. Brown rice? Phenomenal. You don't need expensive proteins. Just make them incredible with how you cook them, or prepare them - a pressure cooker is a great way of making these foods go a long way, is to cook them deliciously. Chilis, garlic, definitely. 
Good question! I got into running & doing triathlons - first of all, I've run over 15 marathons and doubles (ultra-marathons) in South Africa. So I needed a bigger sort of commitment, to spend a little bit more time to myself. So - listen - I love running, but it's given me quality time to spend on my own. SO I got into triathlons about 3 years ago, and it's helped me to stay even more focused in my day to day job. 
Well, first of all, you need help.***Spaghetti in a can!!?!*** That kind of shit we grew out of on our 8th birthday. I still remind my mum that she taught me how to spell with alphabetical spaghetti in a can.You need help, big time.My go-to sort of fast food snack... it would have to be In-N-Out Burger.*Oh my god,* honestly, it is, when I eat Double-Doubles. I am *terrible.* And I always bring it back on the airport when I'm flying from LA to London, I'll sneak it into the first class lounge at BA!
I have an amazing cocktail, which, you know, we're in Atlantic City currently, because we just launched the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill here, which is where we're calling from now. It's with Tanqueray Gin, and it's called "Wake up you Donkey!" I mean, hahahahaha - it is incredible. And also, it's quite sort of spicy, and fragrant, and it's absolutely delicious. 
Wow, that's a great question.Well, negative - the WORST meal? There's been too many of them to tell you about, because the last ten years, working on KITCHEN NIGHTMARES, I've eaten a lot of crap. I think I've drank about THREE and half litres of Pepto-Bismol! And in terms of, you know, good meals - I had an incredible meal at the Black Liquor Market in Studio City. The most amazing Scotch eggs, deviled eggs, and then these short ribs that were braised in beer.*Incredible,* just incredible. 
"Make a U-turn, you *fucking* donkey!"

Oh, gosh.I don't really get a chance to sort of look at the internet. D'you know what? I love that level of connection, and I try to show as much as I can, who I'm with, where I am, and giving people inspiration, so I don't really think of myself as a phenomenon on the internet.I'm a cook. Who happens to be the luckiest cook in the world. 
I would seriously nerd-gasm if this ever happened and was televised. We NEED A Ramsay-Bourdain show!!!!

>I thought Shit! This is delicious!I love that that's how you respond to a good meal.
I've always found Mexican food to be a great cuisine in terms of getting a lot of flavor and nutrition for relatively low cost.
Also, I have to say in a HUUB wet-suit, I look like I've got a fucking 8 pack. Which is unique about a chef in a wet-suit. It's incredible how toned you look. I recommend every chef put on a wetsuit. It makes you look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
Well you can now check "getting yelled at by Gordon Ramsay" off your bucket list you lucky bastard
Hey, sometimes I like to eat like I'm 5 again. :-)I don't eat like that all of the time though. It's a guilty pleasure.
WHAT'S IN IT
> Black Liquor Market in Studio CityThought you must have meant some great place in the UK and not the city three minutes away from my house. But you DID mean Studio City in Los Angeles! I'm so excited to go try this place!
"Just great, *you missed the fucking turn*.
They're essentially living off of their negative press.  They're an internet meme that you can rather easily visit in real life and so they actually benefit from it.

Crap! = bad food, Shit! = good food
Some of my lifetime favorite restaurants are because the food is fantastic, but the service is magic. When I start to look for my server, they are right there. Sometimes they are there a fraction of a second before I know I want them, the rest of the time they are invisible. That's what I pay for when I'm bringing a girl out on a first date. It's a fine art and very much appreciated. To me, it's what makes or breaks the experience when you expect the food to be johnny-on-the-spot.

That was **absolute** gold. I was laughing so hard I cried a little when he said that."So this has probably been in a lady cow?""I'd like to think so."
It does.And I'm not even Ramsay.
Given his comments about Clarkson a few weeks back, I'd probably lean towards the former.
This is so far my favorite AMA of 2015
That's better than what Mel Gibson said."You should just smile... And blow me!!!"

If you wanted, just act bat shit crazy, own a shitty restaurant, and you too can have your dream of getting yelled at by Gordon.
In N Out is a great example of the philosophy that Gordon preached at a lot of confused, bad restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares: figure out what you do well and focus on it. You don't need 50 menu items to be a good eatery. In some cases, you only need 1. 
Is that the full title? Because I want it to be.This is where I make some pun about a cooking show being a mouthful. No, I don't respect myself for it.
Thank /u/chooter
In-N-Out MASTER RACE!
I had such joy reading his response, and I'm still laughing. I'm very visual person, so all I'm thinking of is Gordon going, "Oh, fucking hell! Spaghetti out of a fucking can!"
On his wiki it said the first time he had it he actually finished the burger walked out went to the drive through ordered the same thing and went home with it 
NJ here.  It's not hype. In 'N Out is the best.
Gordon has probably visited more food trucks than me. : (
Hi! I'm always irrationally excited seeing other fellow Khmer people on Reddit. 
Bits of donkey obviously
"The most amazing." Seriously, watch any episode of any of his shows and just count how many times he says this. Like, take a shot for each time and you're done by the end of the episode. It's rather amusing. 
I love the idea that this place is gonna get ready for another night and suddenly get absolutely hammered and have no idea why.
I remember when I was a bit more interested in the story a few years ago that I found that Sami was banned from France and Germany for drug (maybe human as well) trafficking. I found it on a few sources but if it's true then it really wouldn't surprise me that he started a restaurant to launder money.
It's all /u/chooter. Victoria's a wizard.
The power of the meme is scary. 
Have you not seen this episode? It's nothing short of infuriating, it's literally hard to believe. Glad it's out there, though, it's what got me back into KN. 
> A couple tries to prevent Chef Ramsay from discovering their money laundering schemeFTFY
Everything's in the eyes.
That and I'm convinced Samy is laundering money through the restaurant.
I don't think I could SMELL it without puking. That is literally the only creation on that sub that has made me shudder in disgust.
Also, they're blue.
Have you encountered Oatly cream? My wife doesn't do well with cream while I love a lot of cream based cuisine, and cooking with soy cream always sucked.Oatly is oat based from Sweden and works *way* better. It's not perfect, but it is very, very close. Absolutely worth a shot if you can find it (it's common in Europe, but I have not seen it in NA).
Never thought I would hear somebody say Gordon Ramsay is a "zen master" haha
Mr. Ramsay, you've got to make this poor chef great!
Reminds me of how Gordon hired that talented young chef from the shitty restaurant in Paris, in Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon doesn't want to see talent go to waste, it seems!(Piccolo Teatro episode of Kitchen Nightmares UK. s5e2.)
I'd recommend sending him a DM on Twitter as well, because I don't think he's actually controlling this Reddit account.
How gutted would you be if that was Gordon's response.
TIL Victoria is available for awesome AmA backstage questions
Strictly speaking, "nits" is the name for the spent egg-casings of headlice in the UK too. In recent years, "nits" has just become a catch-all term for the lice and their eggs.So you're quite right.
Then you ruined it by spending 5 seconds typing up that thank you note
Wow masterchef Australia has less drama? I've never actually seen the US masterchef (it's hard to find here in the UK) but compared to UK masterchef the aussie one is so full of drama! The uk version is literally just bare bones cooking. No drama whatsoever. 
Shimmy shimmy ya
First AMA ive readand who is Victoria?
What comments?
Heck I think it is up there with one of the best AMAs ever!
I assumed porridge was some weird combination of water and other stuff. Who knew the other stuff was oatmeal? 
Sounds like you need to get your hands on some jelly
Yeah, fucking FOX. It had John Cho, Bradley Cooper, and the kid from Freaks N Geeks. So angry they canceled it.
nah it was just amy
and the money, respect, power, etc, etc
Yeah if I go a few days with with less than 6 hours of sleep, RIP my immune system.
Indian food is insanely good, some of the spices can a bit pricey though.
Pot tiramisu
I got confused for a sec. is this a chef or superhuman?
Why wouldn't you name the subreddit /r/shitramsays
Maybe if you can't come up with a name,  name the restaurant *ABC*? 
And on a massive scale, you have McDonald's, where everything is precision and research.Don't believe me? The Filet O'Fish took a decade to create, because Ray Kroc fucking hated the way fish stinks when it cooks.Frozen french fries? Another decade, with a full complement of research scientists working at a specialized institute.People overlook them, but think of how hard it is to create a global menu that's impossible for even a hungover teen making minimum wage at 5 AM to fuck up.
Another food critic did an AMA a few months back and said his favorite meal ever was a double double from In n Out and a rootbeer
Thank YOU guys.Also, he's very, very nice. 
Last year my best friend came out to visit, had her first taste of In-N-Out. She made me promise we could get it again next time she visits. Nothing like converting someone to In-N-Out. 
As he should, judging by the way he responded to these question. Sleeping 3 hours a day 5 days a week working I would be surprised the chef portion of him avoided anything.He probably tried everything and anything to further improve his skills and knowledge.
a tangible reddit hug of death!
Well... ^thank you. *for* the question... Little girl
What would be the point in getting on Kitchen Nightmares then?
Is Victoria single? I've always wanted to date a wizard!
I used to love KN, but I can hardly watch it anymore simply because it's hard to watch the complete ineptitude. You know how some people have a really hard time watching cringey, embarrassing things whether or not they're scripted? That's what KN is for me at this point. 
Sometimes jokes come off weird when you have cameras on you.
Just watched the episode and that fits remarkably well. "I am the gangster here"
If you watch him cook for his family, or even when he is explaining something to someone who -wants- to learn, he gets very focused on what he is doing, and almost soft spoken.
A subtle point: It doesn't seem like Gordon looks for talent, but grit and hard work. Gordon knows nothing about this guy's ability to cook besides his incredible passion.
Not a chance /u/chooter forgets to let Gordon know about his response, haha! 
you missed the part where he doesn't have a girlfriend 
"You didn't even make this question fresh, it's old from the storage. YOU SERVE THIS TO AMA GUESTS?!"
Good thing we have reddit to be nitpicky about this stuff.^(Kidding, I love learning about regional termonologies. Almost as much as I love making bad puns.)
Damn you and your logic
Oh wow. I should tune into the UK one sometime... The U.S. show is literally 30 minutes of drama and 10 minutes of cooking- and its dirty drama. I couldn't believe how friendly the aus one was.
Pidgey Pidgey caw Pidgey yeah Pidgey cooStand under me, you'll get showered with poo 
Victoria is a reddit employee who dictates our questions to the person giving the AMA and transcribes their answers. All of /u/_Gordon_Ramsay 's answers are actually written by Victoria. Sometimes people will do them in person, but usually Victoria assists them. Her username is /u/chooter. 
No question, it's an all time great. Gordon Ramsay doesn't do anything half assed.
I don't think he's ready for this jelly
dignity, pride, hygiene...
Ye, In stressful times where I get average of only 5 hours or so per night, I already get black rings under my eyes, feel like I have no energy when I wake up, my eyes burn and even my hair sheds like crazy. 
The dragon noodles are delicious. Spicy and delicious, fresh coriander is key. Thats the best part of the summer is basil, coriander and a few others are so cheap cause you can just grow them.

He's nice now, just don't undercook his lunch.
>i'm 75% sure Don't want to be too confident. I'm 75% sure the Earth orbits the Sun, and that blue is a color.
My cousin came from ireland and tried it. Said he preferred mcdonalds. I havent spoken to him since
Maybe he subs gin for tequila?
"Ah time for a nice relaxed Sunday evening... What the fuuuuuuck where did all these people come from?!"
I'm laughing so much at this. It will be the world's longest AMA, due to all the time spent formatting.
I put on my robe and wizard hat...
Sometimes, just sometimes... You're batshit fucking crazy.
Yeah, he has a criminal record for drug trafficking and claims to invested over a million in the restaurant. Plus, he doesn't let the servers enter orders on their system so I think he's generating fake receipts.
That's because they were, you slutty bitch.
OP if Everything works out then can we expect your own ama too? ;)
Lots of people have talent. Not enough people have the determination to put it to use. That goes for lots of pursuits, not just cooking.
OP you need to deliver on this as much you have ever needed to deliver a plate of food to one of your hungry anxious diners.
Please don't let us down /u/chooter!
I've already sent it up the food chain!
Twist: He was talking to a dead houseplant.
There goes another three.
I'm very grateful & humbled.
because this eel is so delicious!
A general sense of manliness...
Not yet, but maybe someday!
You spelled "My mortal enemy and Hitler reborn" really weird, I didn't know it could be one word. 
He is from the UK, that would make sense.
Why are they wearing fedoras?
Children...come closer...what did I SAY...about scooching?
That's me! 
I told you to stop messaging me
Yes, he's using fake orders, and miscounting tip income to launder money that would be one of the ways you do it, he probably also only takes cash for payments? This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone, unless you've never worked under the table or for a business that could have laundered money. 
Oh my god! You were hacked!
Man, if this shit works out we gon do all kinds of shit
I was never a Gordon Ramsey fan. I am now. Well fucking done, chef. Well fucking done. 
Agreed - determined people will obtain talent, and they will always be determined.  Lazy people may be talented, but they'll always be lazy.
chuter plz
GG Victoria 
It's a slow day.   Don't judge me
Nice. A fellow Milwaukeean.Funnily enough, I JUST learned yesterday, as that guy mentioned, that we say roof differently than the rest of the country. I'm 38. Never knew that until getting busted out for it during an Xbox live session. Go pack. 
British bartender reporting in.  We sling a lot of tequila out here. 
Black M'arket Liquor Bar
It'll be eighteen dollars.
But what kind of idiot broadcasts his money laundering setup on reality TV?
Don't make me write you up for animal cruelty.
Fuckin' A tweety, bro. Good on ya.
Saying they'll always be lazy isn't true. But it definitely takes a lot of inner strength and/or discipline to overcome said laziness.
I may be generalising based on what I've seen of American TV but Masterchef seems to reflect the attitudes of the nations pretty well.. The British contestants are reserved, the Australian ones are all ridiculously nice and the Americans hate each other. The contestants on Hell's Kitchen and Top Chef are the same and they're supposedly professional chefs. 
I thought the look of disapproval was like a more fully-realized "absolutely not" along with a Dame Maggie Smith-type facial expression. 
the reason they wanted to be on Kitchen Nightmares was to show the 'haters' on the web (bad reviews on yelp or something) that the restaurant was good. What better way than to make Gordon Ramsay say so on television. When it was obvious he would not do that, I think it stressed her out.Ultimately, I think he did it for his wife, cus she couldn't handle being criticized. Ironic.
Did he just delete just account?
ill have the chicken 
/u/chooter is now an ASCII art critic.
If the restaurant is a front, the haters are irrelevant. And owners dumb enough to think that the producer of a show about turning around terrible restaurants is going to broadcast 42 minutes of him saying "you guys are great!  You certainly don't need *me*!" are too dumb to pull of a long-term racketeering job.Come to think of it, if the restaurant is a front, it's incredibly stupid to attract the kind of infamy they had even before they went on Kitchen Nightmares.

"I just farted" - Cinderella
For the most part I appreciated when parents would stay in character. I hated when people would tell their kids "It's just a guy in a suit, don't be scared", which scares the kids even more. What I didn't like was when they would drill me with trivia questions and make me act out the answers. That used to be fun in the old days but toward the end we had to see as many guests as possible and there was always pressure from management to go faster and faster.
Oh my god I could go on for days about that. One thing that stands out was a special event where they needed 16 Mickeys all set out in various rooms and seeing all of them backstage was really weird. 
A guy once asked me to choke him for a picture (I didn't). That's a hard one because guests routinely do stupid weird things. I think the worst of them is when people bring their newborn infants to the parks and ask us to hold them for a picture. I can't see shit in Goofy let alone other costumes and I'm wearing giant gloves or paws or whatever depending on what character I am. Why would you let me hold your baby? Yeesh!
I worked for Disney in merch at Magic Kingdom, do you remember where in MK he worked? I'm still part of some Facebook groups for Cast Members so I might be able to find him.Either way, if you want him to get recognized, write a letter or email to Guest Relations. It'll help if you know around when you met him and where he worked (so they can find him easier) but it means a lot for a CM to receive a guest letter. We get to take the letter home and get a certificate and it's a really big deal that means a lot to CMs
If you're talking about the "face" performers the answer is yes and no. Some of the break rooms are like the high school cafeteria where the "cool" princesses (elsa and anna) sit on one side and make eyes at the "old" characters (snow and poppins). It's really childish. Other face performers think they're on Broadway and demand respect and they hate not getting it. But those are extreme cases of a few bitches. For the most part the face performers are as much a character as any of us. Some of them are the sweetest people I've ever met in my life.
Goofy is better at golf.
Oh. My. God.The first time some kid asked me to do the Perfect Cast I had no idea what he was talking about so I faked it. The kid didn't buy it but luckily I had an escort (that's what they called attendants back in the day) tell the kid that I already forgot it (which is bullshit if you watch the movie). They don't prepare you for details like that in training. You're just supposed to figure it out yourself. Never met Powerline unfortunately.
That's how this whole AMA started. I made a comment in /r/adviceanimals in response to someone who was frustrated they were 30 and making a career change. I'm 46 now. I have zero job skills other than making people laugh. I never thought I'd ever do anything else so I'm stuck. Maybe working with troubled teens or some other kind of service work. I just want to find something that gives me as much passion as Disney did, which is hard.
We are NOT ALLOWED TO EVER TALK IN COSTUME IN FRONT OF GUESTS. EVER. Backstage however, anything goes. I used to love telling dirty jokes to unsuspecting new hires. I do have a good Goofy laugh but it took me years to perfect.
I once saw an adult beat the absolute living shit out of a pre-teen boy on set as the Queen of Hearts. We're told never to interact when something like that happens so I had to leave. I've seen tons and tons of guests lose their shit in Guest Relations, particularly when it involved people not getting their way. I wish I had a camera sometimes. I would get so much delicious karma from /r/PublicFreakout
Practice actually. It was absolute torture the first month (and especially the first parade) but after a few months I got used to it and after a few years I would forget I had the costume on.
I was fired. To make a complicated story short, Donald Duck was, as usual, being a jerk and wouldn't leave my area because I had signed "Luv, Goofy" right over the bill of a Donald Duck hat. He threw a temper tantrum and as I was dragging him across the floor to get him back to his position a little kid ran out from behind the curtain at Pete's Silly Sideshow and we knocked her on her butt. The kid was fine and no one complained but Disney didn't really appreciate me dragging the costume on the carpeted floor so they terminated me. 
Really?!? I remember feeling like I embarrassed you two! It's so nice to meet your adult self!
It would depend on the situation. I've met my double on set by accident a few times over the years (it happens to the best of us) but it was just that, an accident. The only way someone would get fired (I'm only guessing here) is if they did it on purpose.
I loved every single time someone would try to do it. Only once was I impressed (I mean totally).
Playing peek-a-boo was my standard go-to with frightened children. It also helped if I pretended to be scared too then slowly took steps closer. The worst thing that happens is when parents try to force their kids on me or scold them for being scared. It always made the situation worse.
Almost every time.
They have to attempt to mimic the character's signature to the best of their ability. You sign so much though, it becomes second nature. Wife was sleeping beauty for 3 years. 
Tough call. I'm really partial to the Little Mermaid because of Ursula but I think all in all it has to be Ratatouille. That movie has some of my all time favorite quotes, especially Anton Ego's (sp?) speech at the end of the film. I also loved Dumbo (as racist as it was) but that's because Timothy Q Mouse is probably my favorite character of all.
I would go back in a heartbeat. Unfortunately this AMA would prevent that anyway. My therapist suggested it as a way to provide closure to the grieving process. Thank you for the kind words though. I appreciate it.
That's my dog Max (named after Goofy's son). He's a very good boy. :)
He's an anthropomorphic dog. Yes, we get that question a lot.
Wasn't me but I'd like to shake the hand of the Goofy that helped you. That's a true magic moment.
No, and contrary to popular belief there aren't many furries in the character department. I know there are a few (I knew one of them) but it's not something that's out in the open for sure.
Hmmmm... One is the Automated Vacuum Assisted Collection System in the Magic Kingdom. There's a "tunnel" underneath (it's actually the first floor, the second and third floors are what you see in the park) and the AVACS is a series of tubes that connects all of the restaurants to the main dump that's behind Splash Mountain. The trash is whisked away under the park so the guests don't have to see it or smell it. It's pretty cool.
I frowned once after opening a lanyard I'd bought and found to be frayed. Instantly a cast member appeared. It was creepy.
My signature on my drivers license is Goofy's autograph. I signed it as a joke but the lady at the DMV told me my signature could be anything I wanted. I've signed Goofy by accident a few times. I did a lot of tigger too and would sometimes forget who I was and sign Goofy anyway.
Under the castle in a box marked "beware of the leopard".
I'm not sure if I can ever go back. Right now I'm just doing odd jobs to survive and I'm getting help from my family. The problem is finding my passion. I never intended to leave Disney and that was my passion. I think I'd like to go into a field where I'm able to help people, perhaps with troubled teens or people with addiction problems. I have zero experience though so not many doors are open to me at the moment but I'm working on ways to fix that. :)
We used to be able to sign our character's autograph any way we wanted (except Mickey) but then a guy named Chris came up with standard autographs which are consistently used no matter who the performer is, which is way better in my opinion. We have a small summary of the character that has the autograph on it and we try to make it look the same when we sign. Goofy is easy to do but I can write it upside down which would totally freak the guests out. :) That took a while to learn. I can also sign it behind my head and with my eyes closed.
If you mean the audition process, it's like any dance audition you've ever been to but there's an animation part that's fun (wait tables like Donald Duck, mow the lawn like Pluto, etc.)The casting for everyone else depends on what role you're applying for. Some require a math test, some require multiple interviews. It used to be kind of hard to get hired by Disney but now they'll take anyone who doesn't have multiple felonies on their record. They just got too big.
It's just a room over the candy shop on main street. There's an officer back there that takes people to the local jail on 33rd street in Orlando.
Goofy wasn't so bad, it was Baloo and Br'er Bear that were horrible because the gas kind of festers inside the costume. One time I farted before going out on set as Br'er Bear and when I opened the door there was a small child there. I knelt down to meet him and all the air in my costume got squeezed up and out of my neck (were we see from in that costume). I know it sounds like I'm making this up but I almost knocked the kid over. I had to leave set because I was laughing so much, mostly because he said "Ooooh you have bad breath".
I once misjudged a step and ended up in the mud up to my knees at a park once (it was a special cast member event so I got away with it). I've tripped countless times and was always able to make it part of the act so to speak. I almost cut off a guest's toes once (I was Baloo and she was wearing open sandals) which was disgusting because of the blood. I also fell down the stairs on the castle stage as the Queen of Hearts once. Not my proudest moment.
What it feels like to put a genuine smile on someone's face while dressed up as a character.
Not OP but lived in Orlando and can answer the second one. They're technically not ever allowed to say that they ARE the character, they're supposed to tell people theyr'e "friends with" the character. A college friend of mine was "friends with" Belle. But most people who live around here know someone at Disney and so we all know what the code means. 
When my daughter was 4 she made Pluto cry. We were at the Disney Hotel in DL. Pluto ran over to me and my kids. My eldest daughter wasn't ever afraid of the characters but my 4 year old never wanted anything to do with them. (Wouldn't even sit on Santa's lap at Christmas time) Pluto ran over and waved at us but my 4 year old ran away from him. He chased after her a few steps in a way to plead with her but when he wasn't able to win her over he ran over to a bench and laid down and sobbed. My heartless toddler didn't give a shit if she made that dog cry. 
Honestly, it was my most exciting moment at work. I still can't believe they let me do that. 
Quite Goofy. Quite.
Honestly, it depends. We have some people that dream of working at Disney their entire lives. Some of them freak out when they find out how it all works and they get bitter. Others come in bitter and Disney gets them and they're full of the dust (the Pixie kind). Personally, I was gung-ho at first then calmed down a bit but then exploded again. I loved working there. Well, I loved being on stage with guests. Backstage, the managers are always on your ass, which used to be different. Sad really, but that's the way it went.
I got lost at typhoon lagoon. I played checkers with some dude for like 30 minutes until my family found me.
The former. Donald is a tiny bitch.
Wear comfortable shoes. Book your restaurants in advance. Try not to bring your busy life with you. Enjoy the scenery while you're waiting in the queues. It's a good opportunity to people watch. Don't expect to do half of what you want to do. Prioritize and get the most important stuff out of the way **on the first day**. Don't wait. And know that part of the fun of Disney is discovering things as you go. Ask your fellow guests in line what they think is cool. You'll make some friends and uncover more about the park than I could ever tell you! :) Have fun and say hi to Goofy for me okay?

>That used to be fun in the old days but toward the end we had to see as many guests as possible and there was always pressure from management to go faster and faster.Thats really depressing in an odd way
> they needed 16 Mickeys all set out in various roomsComing from Ireland (and UK too I think?), that sounds like an entirely un-Disney kind of a night.
People are idiots. 
It was the 1st store to the left on Main Street.  It was November 30, 2016. I already wrote a review on Facebook mentioning him but I'll write a letter for sure!! 
> Some of the break rooms are like the high school cafeteria where the "cool" princesses (elsa and anna) sit on one side and make eyes at the "old" characters (snow and poppins). This is the most amusing thing I've read in the whole AMA. Disney princess cliques. I worked in an amusement park where the rollercoaster ride attendants were cooler than the kiddie ride attendants. We all do the same thing for minimum wage guys!Why would you give this gold instead of OP.
It's the thumbs.
The Great Goofini was trying to get one of our kids to "fly" with him for a photo a few years back.  The boy wasn't following the plot until Goofy whispered "You.  Fly!" in his ear.He still talks about it with wide-eyed wonder.
Shit, that had to be traumatic for the kid. Not only he is beaten in public but his childhood hero Goofy sees it and decide to turn around and walk away... He must felt betrayed.  
do the suits get washed regularly?  like daily? i would think they would get pretty rank after a few days in the Florida heat
After 20 years, you were fired over that? Was it a full on fight lol?
OP, blink twice if they are standing behind you.
Thank god, I have to dress up as a certain Giraffe at a certain toy store and I constantly smile in the costume and I'm not sure if smiling or not smiling makes me feel like more of an insane person. Hearing it from a professional makes me feel better.
I never thought I'd care but my life might not be complete without knowing now.

I met you as Goofy around 2001!! I had completely forgotten this memory until I reading this, but I distinctly remember Goofy signing an autograph behind his head! You have completely blown my mind
I had to "make and eat spaghetti" when I auditioned in '98.
did said dance involve a black/brown leather couch 
How does cutting a guest's toes not get you fired but bumping into a child does??

I heard about Pluto. That's messed up.

Yes, some just wear costumes instead. Wait...
understatement of the fucking year, mate. 
Woah, same here.At our park only females could be kiddie ride attendants, and I'm female.I used to fight tooth and nail to stay in the "adult rides" section. That's where my friends were, and I didn't want to be friends with those other girls.I feel bad now, haha.
I'd guess that they get more attention from kids, who may have never seen the older movies but have certainly seen frozen. That may falsely lead to the actresses believing that they're better at what they do, since attention often is the result of talent for entertainment types.
Garsh, ma'am, looks like you sure do suck at raising kids
Also the comment about Goofy holding the Make-a-Wish kid.Also the fact that he dragged Donald across the floor to get him to stop being a jerk. If anything I feel like he's building up the Disney Magic.
My job that night was to check receipts at the door of the Emporium to make sure kids weren't stealing shit. One kid was walking out with a hat (he was a BIG kid) and when I grabbed it off his head he pushed me up against the wall and said "Touch me again and I'll fucking gut you". I just smiled and said "Be safe tonight".
That sounds... vaguely threatening.
You have to pantomime 9-1-1
All the characters have a "handler" that would probably take care of harder things like that
He said he was the Queen of Hearts tho
Yeah man every. single. day. Also was a character performer 
yeah it's called sweating
That's a long and painful story. Disney still has no idea the pain and trauma that caused. There were other reasons I think I was not brought back, one of them being terrible legal advise from a lawyer I sought out before my final arbitration. I was also sort of a whistle-blower and I think that played a big role.
Well, they took him out back and shot him in the beak. You don't just walk away from Disney.
He already got fired lol
The horror. The magical horror......

The widely accepted theory are that clothes are what make the difference in intelligence. Pluto just has a collar. Chip and Dale are a good example. They can't talk in any circumstance but in Rescue Rangers, where they wear clothes.
Duh why do you think  he stayed 20 years 
That sounds like a dirty Disney character.
you mean "bad eggs"? (or "bad nuts" for the purists)
Someone wasn't respecting the five-second rule...
Unless they can all sign it upside-down I definitely met this guy too
He did mention that he lost his job over Donald being a tiny bitch so the feelings are real.
I was going to say the same thing. That hit me like a ton of sad bricks.
So much of the Stark Expo reminded me of Disney World. John Slattery's Howard Stark reminded me a lot of Disney, actually.

I'm in child welfare. They might be temporarily placed but I'm sure they got home. Embassies would be involved in something like this. Especially since I'm sure media was involved. The only time they're absolutely guaranteed not to fuck things up royally is in media cases. 
I know I'm crying, you don't need to remind me. Such a touching story. Thanks OP made my day that much better
I'm taking some comfort knowing people all over the world are crying at the same time as me about the exact same thing. 
Just sent more Play-Doh. And going to give my kids more time , after drying up. Damnit.
So I'm not the only one 
i'M WEEPING AT WORK AND i'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON REDDIT !Just lied to my boss and told her I got choked on candy....Good Guy Goofy. and everyone 
It would do Anna and Elsa well to remember that everyone was the most popular princess once
I haven't been gotten by a meme like that in a long time.I'm proud of him
It can't be anything that unexpected\*watches video*Oh shit, you're not wrong.
This is hilarious and I can see it working. Talk about an ice breaker from left field. 
your son is now in jail **GUH-HYUK**
I think the most standout one is about the sisters who were involved in a car accident. I had to take a breather after reading that, it was a really sad story but he did an amazingly beautiful thing for them.

Every day - on rare ridiculously hot days, I'd personally go through two costumes a day.

Tell the truth - she ever get to bring the Mickey mouse costume home?  Were you Goofy, Pluto or Minnie?

This mindset always baffles me from companies.  Seems like hiring someone new is a way bigger risk then keeping someone who made a mess up after 20 years of consistency.
A-hyuk a-hyuk a-hyuk *reveals glock* hey donald i need some fishing bait
That's why there's an AMA
'Butts Grocery' just doesn't have the same ring as H.E.B.  on the bright side, instead of the H-E-Buddy, you'd have Butts-Buddy.You can't win them all...

No wonder Donald Duck is such a jackass. He doesn't wear pants, so is constantly torn between sapience and raw animal instincts. It would also explain Scrooge's unbridled greed to some degree; he doesn't have adequate impulse control.
Nothing like railing Elsa with that damn goofy mask on. Ahuhuhuh-hyuck!
He'll be the villain of the Lion King 3: Simba's Bloodlust
I'll tell you a fun story about good historical re-enactors. When my mother was in highschool, they went on a field trip to Plimoth Plantation. One kid brought his Walkman (with either Metallica or Iron Maiden, I forget which) and put it on the ears of their carriage driver.The dude totally flipped out about "devil music" and drove the carriage to the center of town, where they proceeded to put the kid in the fake stocks and have a trial for his witchcraft. Apparently it was amazing and hysterical and everyone loved it.
Third time in this thread.
Wasn't that the point? The whole thing was an EPCOT reference.

Former special educator here: people can search "abilitations" on amazon to find tons of toys and therapeutic stuff for children with special needs. Some of these items can also work well as soothers for children who don't have special needs, per se, but may not be up to their normal play due to symptoms or treatment side effects. (Light projectors, stuff that plays music, sound machines that do rain or ocean sounds, etc. can be a real boon to nurses and parents who are trying to help kids relax and sleep when they're not feeling well.)
I used to hear them in my sleep. Now I don't hear a beep. 
I'm glad I read this one at home.
Sitting in a class in the military doing the same thing. Mostly because I'm not supposed to be on Reddit, but also because I can't let these other grown ass men see me cry, right?
Be cynical, but please be cynical about the company, not the people. The "boots on the ground" really make that place something special every day.
What about Tiana?
Almost closed it right before I got got. Kind of glad I didn't.
I am here crying and laughing my ass off.
Right, the fact that the audio was low as shit and it forced me to raise my volume did not do me any favors.
Read the entire thread and this is what got me

Grad Night 2001. We took E and I'll tell you what, Disney has never been more fucking magical. When on E you know the others who are as well. So many people were rolling it's not even funny. Peaked while stepping off the haunted house ride at the end, proceeded to run up the moving floor thing and bounced with every step. Anytime I go back now as an adult and I feel that bouncer material under my feet it instantly takes me back.haha 5/7 would do again.
I can almost guarantee they did, I'm sure they had 5 different cameras capturing the event
I personally go through three in some cases. And I'm just a visitor.
Of all the AMAs where I really couldn't care if the guy was legitimate or not, he gives me 17 pictures of him loving Disney. Man I wished I even _liked_ my job.

Yeah, 20 years isn't anything to scoff at. My guess would be that it's an easy way to avoid paying benefits. Surely someone will fuck up given enough decades. Fire them before they can retire. 
TIME TO DELIVER A PIZZA BALL!!!
It was to show that:1) Can't see shit as to where the titties are, so it was an accident.2) Can't really grope on purpose when you're wearing oven mitts. You just kinda flail around and sometimes grab some boob.I'm not saying as to whether or not that's all true, but that's why he wore it in the courtroom, to demonstrate those points.
Well evidently it worked cause the dude got his job back lol
**Strong disliked that**
A-hyuk, a hyuk, he's about to let it snow! 
It really was magic meeting him, he truly changed our lives!
A magical clickbaiter.

Let em see. People confuse manhood, strength, integrity, honor and courage with being stoic.What I'd see is a soldier who I know would drop everything, his heart not diminished, to go help a child.There is honor in empathy. There is glory in love. There is majesty in compassion. 
I was ready for the magic of Disneyland to disappear when I came into the thread and I fucking love Disneyland.I sincerely believe that Disneyland is even more special now.
I did close it, and after reading your comment, went back to watch the whole thing.  No regrets.
Big Mouse is always watching.
I know you're joking but after my first day walking round a park in Orlando I had to take a change of t-shirt for pretty much the rest of the trip. Not built for 40C and 100% humidity!
That wouldn't be an all day solution, eventually the pressure inside the suit would build too much and it would rupture.
I can't believe how many people in this thread dated Disney characters
And the 7 drone strikes

Yeah, like what the fuck is happening on reddit today?First that Fred Rodgers thread decimates me and now this?
So is Goofy.
Yes. See my first appearance on Jimmy Kimmel. 
No because the shorter my fights are, the more fights I can have. I only have a finite amount of fight time, and I'd like to fight as long as possible. 
I have complete silence before I walk out before a fight. No talking in the locker room, no music, cellphones on silent. If I hear a ding from you taking a video you're gonna get your own private Rowdy Glare.

I would always play as Princess Katana 'cuz in the Sega version you could press down and punch up vs the computer and get to the fifth guy from the top with all flawless victories because the computer wouldn't learn to throw you from the floor until it was almost the end.

Demetrious Johnson. I think he's the most well-rounded and I feel like I'm watching one of the later episodes of Dragon Ball Z when you only see one second of action going on between them disappearing 'cuz they're going so damn fast. I wouldn't be surprised if rocks start levitating around the ring because of all the energy emanating from it. Might Mouse vs. Dominick Cruz was one of my favorite (and most under-appreciated) fights ever. 
That one gnarly giant dude from 300. 
Yes. Very soon. It's just my life is crazy sauce, so it's hard to do just fun stuff. Apart from reddit :)
Leon The Professional. 
well... a lot of the good ones have been taken, but I'd like to vie for Miss Marvel. 
I accept that I have NO control over my image already. So, I try not to let the state of my perception have any effect on my happiness. You can never truly know anyone through only media anyway. If anything I just try to keep in mind that I'm an entertainer and not a politician or Miss America.
Buffalo Bill. Him destroying the buffalo population of America also destroyed the Native American culture and coming from Jamestown ND, which boasts having the largest statue of a buffalo in the world, the plight of the buffalo is quite near and dear to my heart.
i always get super stoked when I see it's a Daenarys (the ANTI D.N.B.) chapter, and would get really bummed when I saw it was a Catlyn chapter. But for some reason my heart is always Team Stark. My sigil would be a Mew with Vegeta hair.
At least 60 in one sitting. But there were no bets on the table. I think I could've done more if it really came down to it.
No, I've never seen it. But I wish I had now.
TaiChi Panda doesn't have races. I have a night elf hunter on WoW. (Yeah I know everyone starts with that but I also have a blood elf rogue that I'm working on). 
Having the same conversation over and over reminds me of bar-tending, and I'm thankful for the training I received having to deal with stupid questions from repetitive drunks. I only do it because I know I'll receive tips at the end ;)

Only in post.The advice: for any woman trying to break into a male-dominated career, I'd say the greatest thing you can do is always keep in mind that you always have the right to be there.
Well... try to be more self-sufficient and less cabana boy. ;)
I know I'm not rowdy.but, you do the sports and activities for YOU. Don't let them bother you. In 10 years you're still going to be buff and fit, and all them will be wishing they were you, or with you. 
I guess you missed the 34 second window?
I don't know but I'd imagine that Bluetista has a lot of patience. ;)
Definitely. I loved being in Wrestlemania and will find a way to get back in the squared circle I just have no clue when. And any real wrestling fan would want to be surprised anyway.

1 Mew sized Mewtwo, 'cuz everyone knows that even though Mewtwo has better stats than Mew, 100 Mews totally overcome that.
Ooooooh. Since I've been playing from the beginning I have a certain affinity for the psychic type. But that being said, fairies seem pretty badass these days but I gotta go with the original 151 types and psychic was my fave because Mew is my jam. 
Say, 'fuck them' and do what makes you happy.
Sounds tempting.... but I prefer a man to have the balls to ask me through a medium other than the Internet. Good try though- you sound like a catch. ;)

This is by far the least predictable AMA I've ever seen.
/u/AWildSketchAppeared hello? 
You NEED to watch it. It really is a prime example of a great 90's movie. One of my all time favorites.It also has Ernie Reyes Sr and Jr, and early Rob Schneider which is a nice bonus :D*edit*All these quote replies are making me nostalgic for it, Surf Ninjas movie night it is!
Don't call her a noob or she'll pvp you irl :-)
A reply for that video is what I hoped to see in this AMA.  It made me happier than it probably should have. 
I swear to God he is
Donnie Baker has been a part of the Bob & Tom radio show for ages.  He's done a lot of great comedy.  Look up damn near any Bob and Tom show from the past....I dunno 6-8 years at last, and he probably has at least one "phone call" in most of them.Dude's great, so are B&T too.  
*realizes Ronda makes more by talking to reporters than I do for a month's salary*

The post was edited to a simple short question because it got some negative answers.Edit for clarity, the short post was :>Q: How do you feel about Fedor's comments about you and women's mma? OP then changed it back to the original ( the one we can see now) when people showed support.Ronda answered to the short version and, I think, didn't see the full versionI really hope she reads and react to the full post.
i aint come here to play sch -- ask non-pokemon questions
I doubt she could do the latter. While she's in an actual gym I'm running through Hoenn with my woes

IIRC it was made by Naughty Dog for an award show.
Yea RIP Kyle Hawk, I guess Ronda will have to move on to Mike Hawk
If not dead on the outside, it's in the inside.

We all knew she'd win anyway
If you want to get to orbit or beyond, go with pure rockets. It is not like Von Braun and Korolev didn't know about airplanes and they were really smart dudes.
Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom.We are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure.
At first, I was thinking we would just scale up Falcon Heavy, but it looks like it probably makes more sense just to have a single monster boost stage.
There should definitely be a science mission to Europa
I pretty much made that up. I have no idea :)The grid fins are super important for landing with precision. The aerodynamic forces are way too strong for the nitrogen thrusters. In particular, achieving pitch trim is hopeless. Our atmosphere is like molasses at Mach 4!
There is a great quote by Churchill: "If you're going through hell, keep going."
It won't look like other cars
Yes, but probably only a few hoursParty at Cocoa Beach! 
This question probably breaks certain agreements sadly
Goal is 100 metric tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars. This obviously requires a very big spaceship and booster system.
Default plan is to have a sea level and vacuum version of Raptor, much like Merlin. Since the booster and spaceship will both have multiple engines, we don't have to have fundamentally different designs. This plan might change.
SR-71Hard to pick a favorite. I tend to like FPS with a story, like Bioshock, Fallout or Mass Effect, but was also a big fan of Civ and Warcraft.French and BBQWhiskey
As interesting as the space-related stuff is, this is exactly the topic I'd like to know more about.  The concerns were pretty serious, so, yes -- what galvanised them, I wonder...
Yes, he has talked about electric, supersonic, vertical take off and landing jets. He thinks that once batteries reach an energy density of 400 wh/kg, it will be feasible to have a range of 2000-3000 miles.He's also talked about making pre-fabricated freeway sections to speed up construction on the 405. (he has to sit through the traffic there almost every day).
Yeah, they were great
He actually invented time travel in the future, and realized by looking at ancient records of "The Great Modernizer" of the 21st century that this figure was, actually, himself. He knew from that point on that he had to return to push humanity forward.This would be make a great writing prompt. 
Pretty sure you can count yourself in that list of "smart dudes" now.
I hope all goes well.  Thanks for the answer.  I've been searching for info on your plans for months.I'd imagined some sort of powder actuated fastener system firing structural bolts into the deck of the barge after landing and before crew arrives.   It must be more stable than I thought though.
Nice to see you are doing things the Kerbal way.
Bro haven't you seen the movie? Awful idea. Octopus monsters.
Can you help me with Kerbal Space Program?
I see you haven't forgotten your Computer Science roots (trunk?). Hopefully you are still thread safe. 
\>doing the science math
What kind of mass ratio do your upper stages have?
Thanks for answering! I teach high school astronomy in Orlando, and we always watch your rocket launches and talk about SpaceX. We're big fans. I'll get to work on my storytelling skills. 
Uh oh, I hope you don't mean that it'll look dorky like a BMW i3 or a Toyota Mirai. It won't look dorky... Right?
Elon got the club going up on a Tuesday
Oh my goodness, I am so starstruck. You responded!! Thanks for the information, and thank you so much for responding!! You made my year!!By the way, might 27 be the number of engines you're talking about? ;)
> bada**FTFY
Seriously, he kinda rocks. Is there some sort of Reddit award system for really awesome Mods?
/r/SpaceX denizens, do your math now please!
Kerbal Space Program!
Awesome, thanks so much for responding!
Why?  United Launch Alliance is watching SpaceX like a hawk, and that post is the meat and potatoes.  He shouldn't answer it.We'll have the answer, in time.  That's the most exciting part.
How do you find time to play video games?
Blue! No, Ye-
Is a cycle a firing?
Proud to be a Saffa right now! You guys used to thrash us on the rugby pitch. 
And just to add, these regulations restrict both human-operated and computer-operated vehicles.
I don't know if I could handle being rich enough to have a freeway built because I'm sick of traffic.. I'd be like Zoidberg on double turkey thanksgiving.
Awesome! Glad you enjoyed them!
Yet another role for Cumberbatch
Unfortunately I could only hope for an entry level position but I would be first in line and work my ass off for decades to become important within the company.
Yeah, if Elon succeeds with the whole cheaply and rapidly reusable thing, his name is going up there next to von Braun and Goddard.
I'd be interested to hear his thoughts on that.  The orbiters were never really meant to do the same thing rockets were (an orbiter would probably never have made it to Mars), but further developments like the X-37B seem to be really good at... whatever secret thing it's doing.  And they certainly seemed useful in building the ISS.
Kerbal is awesome!
> monster boost stage. In order to support this we will of course have to increase the number of struts. 
Bill Cosby's nutsack called Elon Musk "bro".And with that, a very good night to all.

There is no spoon.
fundamentals start very early on.  Teachers have to assume that you're getting whatever fundamentals from the prior year otherwise they'd be stuck teaching the same shit over and over year after year. 
I'm reading caves of steel. Considering myself semi-spoiled... 
With sub-cooled propellant, I think we can get the Falcon 9 upper stage mass ratio (excluding payload) to somewhere between 25 and 30. Another way of saying that is the upper stage would be close to 97% propellant by mass.
As an Orlando native, we desperately need teachers like you! 
start world war III.  profit.
This is the same guy who is making sure his space suits look sexy.  I doubt his new car will be a dorkmobile.

Totally. It's a historical fact that space exploration can drive business by inspiring new technology, designs, and overall creativity from private sector makers of goods. Kids who witness this stuff now and have their interest piqued, by any aspect of it, might just have enough staying motivation to pursue those fields.
We're getting enough new numbers here for a dozen new discussion posts full of math :)
I am not surprised by this.
The learning curve is something like 25 years.
This is almost like a personal Q&A for you. Awesome! 
He's probably hiding time travel from us.
this is a valid question
I wonder if he nuked Megaton?
I'm pretty sure a cycle is a single start/run/stop sequence.
He didn't even use a period, he must have hated those hiking boots. 
That easy huh?
Ya, revolutionizing online payment options and singlehandedly taking on the American automobile industry are more like hobbies anyways.
He designs the people that design the rockets.
In the off chance u/elonmuskofficial reads this, Elon, we think you're awesome, too. <3 All of us at Squad.
Taint nothing
So say we all! All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.
*Wouldnt it be cool if rockets were reusable?*
Here Lies /u/usa_dublin.  Elon Musk answered his question once.
He played it once and thought:"Yeah, this is *okay.*"
Now there's a tough choice: Elon Musk or Scott Manley for KSP lessons.
Don't worry, it's hard to build a rocket that can't go up./r/kerbalspaceprogram is friendly too.
Despite the stereotypes, we have _a lot_ of really good public schools in the US. We just also have a lot of awful ones :(
Nah, we're into a new century now. Got to start again at 1
he had me at I
I can't believe someone even asked that. Elon is incapable of making anything look dorky. Its like an allergic reaction. Even the trash cans at SpaceX look cool (if maybe a teeny bit dorky now that I think of it).
Rocket goin, up
Hey, I hope you know that it is medically recommended that you get 7-8 hours of sleep **minimum**. If you don't, you won't become an^extremely^successful^billionaire
I don't think he actually sleeps, he just recharges his battery while doing this AMA.
Nope. And he does not have a butthole; he has no need for one.
You underestimate just how cool this is for me :)
These humans may have not figured out warp speed, but God damnit do they look good 
Fuck CHARLI XCX too. I really wanted to ask her.
Balderdash!
For $10,000,000? I'd build a robot that curses for you on the internet by your command for that money!^^^^We ^^^^will ^^^^gladly ^^^^accept ^^^^investors ^^^^for ^^^^this ^^^^idea

Plot twist, rage quit.Decided to launch a real rocket instead.
"Sir, this is just a pile of decouplers and boosters taped together""Yeah?  Well I made it to Eve AND BACK with that sucker!  Start taping!"
Easier than EVE.
Only so much he can reveal every year... :|
Wow.. I'm going to turn out to be an astronaut 
Sadly SpaceX predates Mass Effect. 
They were the only good hiking boots we had in his size, so he really didn't have much choice.
^^^It's ^^^the ^^^money
I mean they are a big deal, but hardly related to rocket science.  So it would be pretty unlikely to put your name next to two famous rocket scientist 
And then designs the rockets anyway. 
Elon Kerman added to crew name pool.Cheers :)
He also plays Human Space Program.^(I hope the next update is good.)
It sure did! Max and I are currently freaking out like girls at a Backstreet Boys show in 1999.
Yup, SpaceX's FB page just posted that they're doing the weekly challenge and that tomorrow's F9 launch will start upside down
KSP CM here. So far, an official one is not in the cards, but if we had the opportunity to work with SpaceX on one, we'd do it in a heartbeat.
Ever coming back as a modder? We've missed you!
Can confirm, am proud.
But a G-strang.
That would require more delta-V than necessary!

"Graphics could use some work, but I know little about game design.  I'll just go launch some real rockets instead."
Why not both? A joint session
Dude, not even joking, but all it really takes is watching a couple videos and a LOT of trial and error. I sucked at this game a week ago, but I just docked at my first space station a few hours ago!
HULLLOOO!!!
This century is all about the reboots.
He had me at /u/ElonMuskOfficial
> La CucarachaI always ask "does it play La Cucaracha?" when getting into a friend's car for the first time. No one ever gets the joke :(
I found myself laughing with them
Come on dude it's Elon Musk,  the hell is he going to make something dorky for.  Also Breckenridge Bourbon get on it!
I had to go check if he was born Elon. Apparently he was. The plot thickens...
SO LET IT BE DONE
On a Tuesday. Fire stage one then jettison that caboose-ay.
Not actually true. As you get older, you need less and less sleep. At Elon's age, 6 hours is probably just about right, providing he has a good diet.
I wonder if he dreams of electric sheep?^of ^course ^he ^does^.
He works so hard, he burns off energy from the inside.
That tiger has night vision goggles?!?
Bah, humbug!
*wipes grime from calculator and flips racing toggle to launch Matlab*
Close enough
*"Fuck this bullshit game! I'm rich, I'll build a real motherfucking rocket and show those little green assholes! I'm going the fuck to MARS!"*We later discover that Tesla exists because Mr. Musk got his ass kicked at *Gran Turismo* a few years back.
it's actually not *technically* time travel:the dude's got a hyperbolic time chamber, y'all.next up, senzu beans, i'm sure of it
Probably not, not even time lords can go past the end of the universe.
nothing predates Protheans
your boss just read your first comment and was ready to promote you, and then read this and slammed his fist on the table.
Yeah, but it's not exactly brain surgery...
Oh no... That means I'll end up blowing up the real life Tony Stark... #gameishard.
Can I be awesome too?
HSP 1.999991Changelog:Increased base weight of humans to balance difficulty
Elon... is Jeb? *backs away from the computer*
You made something that Elon Musk finds awesome. Be proud Max, be proud.
I got wayy too excited for the official SpaceX entry to the challenge before I got to the end of your sentence :-P
/u/ElonMuskOfficial please make this happen. We have NASA Asteroids, lets now do a SpaceX Duna pack!
I agree, grid fins would be awesome, but of all the people saying they need them it amuses me that the man who has done some the most outrageous landings is asking for them.
Can confirm boss is proud
KSP Player spotted
And the secret to flying is throwing yourself at the ground, and missing...
Elon musk VS. Scott Manley in KSP for charity :)
It'd probably involve venting O2 from the car to lower your perapsis.Right /u/illectro (/u/ilectro) ?
World War 0: A prequel. 
He had me at [-]
I laughed at the situation.  Prolific electric car creator considers his competition laughable.
Dude, totally unrelated to the topic at hand, but my brother brought me home a bottle of Breckinridge. Really great stuff, and I'm normally not a bourbon guy.  
maybe his parents were von braun fans and tried to push him in this direction?
You're HIV Elon
I'm just gonn have another- TEST
Guys... you're embarrassing me in front of Mr. Musk.
More like OKStupid amiright? 
Let's just hope nobody kicks his ass in Left For Dead or Resident Evil.
With more boosters. 
Except the Inusannon, Leviathan, Reapers, and untold other interstellar sapient races...
Good thing I don't work there anymore.
Or... brain rockets!!!
Yes! You can! 
And that's a KSP developer, ladies and gentlemen.Thanks for making such an awesome game
Are they doing a rolling update? Seems the North America server got the update first. 
Nah, I'd think he's Wernher.
I never lose any Kerbals - I know exactly where my Kerbals end up.  Sometimes its a permanent vacation orbiting the system, other times there are small bits of them over here, more bits over there...
And ESA flags 
Anyone here that is NOT a ksp player?
TIL missing is hard
Now I would donate for that 
It's the first one. I won't type it again so I don't accidentally anger the deity of my favorite game with my irrelevant comment.
He fired you that quick over a Reddit comment? Shit man, times are tough
Mind... blown.
I'm so proud to be punching the same planets Elon Musk is landing on. 
It's not called the Beta World for nothing.
No...he's the mysterious chairman of the Space Program that has yet to be revealed.
TIL Gandalf plays KSP!
Only if they add comets.
i hope not :D
WWII II: Electric boogatanks
We're impatient okay.
All hail the great planet puncher  
I'm sick of these motherfucking wars on this motherfucking world!
Might I add that if it could be in layman terms, that would be great.
They all leak eventually, this one isn't worse. More to the point of the protests and resistance, it was planned to go through sovereign Indigenous territory, and when they declined they were met with force. US law does not give them the right to do this, it is illegal.
I think in a previous post on the topic it was pointed out that moving the same oil by rail is probably far more dangerous for the environment.  Wish I could find the reference.
I'm a layman and not even American so my knowledge of this is weak at best, but my guess is that there will likely be more to gained from the potential attention to the issues lawsuits like this might bring rather than the results of the judgment.
Public donations. It's in the description of this AMA. 
Also are you well versed in bird law?
I would like to know this too!
Kinda strange to hold a Job and hate what the missions of the job are. But here we are.
Much higher upvoted comment asked. Ignored.
Not necessarily. A truck or train spills and there's a specific amount of spill and awareness of it. Pipelines have massive amounts flowing through them and can leak small amounts for a long time without anyone realizing it. Or spring a huge leak and spill ridiculous amounts in land in the middle of nowhere with groundwater implications.
Good question.
Congratulations on graduating! Thank you for pursuing such a great cause. Best of luck 
Earthjustice is a nonprofit, so they are funded by donors and foundations -- and they don't charge their clients anything for the work that they do. I used to work for them. 
Good point but Trump will most likely not show up in these cases in court. The DoJ will represent him in court. EarthJustice has won cases against the DoJ before--it'll happen again. No, they won't win all of these lawsuits, but they will win some of them.
The organization has filed numerous suits against the Obama administration, so since then at least it seems
Do you want to get a REEE? Cause that's how you get a REEE.
Quite a few yes. Many of which are just insulting the OP. Pro-Trump people seem to be upset because they can't defend the fact that he is actively harming the environment with his actions and orders.
You can sign up as a campaign manager for summer internships, you make awesome friends, get paid, and it's for a good causeI actually got into politics for a bit because of that, and realized both parties are absolute shit holes
54.1k yet the top upvoted question only has 1400 votes. Then it quickly drops from there. That's pretty shady.
In another comment he said they did sue Obama for a ton of stuff. 
Wasting taxpayer money on frivolous lawsuits AND killing economy by increasing dependence on foreign oil (and everyone blamed Bush for made up ulterior motives for the war in the middle east), AND killing American jobs.
Open an investigation into Russia's ties with the lawsuit
More damage from protests than pipeline? How do you know if it's not done? I'm happy for the polar bears. When the earth heats up more water evaporates in the atmosphere, increasing snowfall in areas. Antarctica saw a high three years ago? It's gone.  Both Arctic and Antarctica ice are on a downward trend. Speculation and half truths 
What could they do, send the Pinkerton's after  them?
Because the environment isn't broad enough for you? It kind of affects everyone, everywhere.
That's something interesting that I would like to know as well. But, I suspect the answer is no unless you believe that the free market will find it in its best interest to protect the environment...and I don't particularly think that it will, not yet anyway.
From what I've gathered in OP's responses, it's legal for the President to designate these areas but not legal to reverse this designation because that power resides with Congress. 
> I would like to know what your organizations policy on nuclear power is? Probably because their law firm doesn't have any type of official "policy on nuclear power." Silly question.
My degree is in wind energy and I, and almost everyone who went through the program, would agree that nuclear power is the way to go in order to get high production and low pollution. But there are many people who are uneducated in the matters of "clean" energy who are 100% for wind and solar and also 100% against nuclear. But everyone I know in the wind industry are for nuclear power.
Types like what, exactly?I, for one, don't think anything ill of nuclear energy, mainly because I have a basic understanding of how and why it works (keyword: basic. source: brother is a nuclear engineer).  I also completely agree with basically everything that OP is fighting for that I have read in this thread.  So, I'm kinda confused why you'd think that "types like these" would be against clean energy that has some manageable side affects when combating completely unclean sources like coal and oil.
Don't forget the oil transport by water. Which is even worse then a pipe
It won't be tops for long.Had the tribe gotten $20,000,000, the DAPL issue would be a moot point.
You should. Without them, we'd still have unsafe lead in our paint and air.
Perhaps the gain is multi-directional?  The lawsuits serve to slow or tie the hands of wasters; the news of the lawsuits--especially in a nation whose federal government actively seeks to control information--is itself valuable, as we cannot fight what we do not see.  Also the news damages the brand of the polluter, which will hurt him financially and may prompt him to reconsider.  Good all round?
Why? It was answered in the OP
And what size are your hands?
Shiiiiieeeetttttt
And one that they seem very reluctant to answer for some reason.  Probably because it's outside the scope of their current litigation efforts, but still.
I think more likely he just doesn't want anything he has to say regarding this written down while the case is ongoing. I'm sure the defense in this case asked similar questions, and they could pretty easily find this. 
But they will continue to get upvoted because most people don't read past the top-level comments.
I'm neutral on Trump. But OP mentioned a lot of Trump voters' are in favor of protection of the environment it seems the minority of the Trump voters are loud and vocal here and/or lobbying firms have paid astroturfers down voting and trolling much like the left has on r/politics and r/politcaldiscussion.
I find it amusing that you'd say this when /r/the_donald literally has to disallow downvotes so you all can have your snowflake safe space and pretend everyone else is "circlejerking", when you define the very word.
Exactly.  He is a lawyer. 
You should be bothered. That fucking clown will have an effect on net neutrality which will have an effect on things like netflix and pc gaming around the globe. Maybe not directly but indirectly for sure. I live Japan and I am worried about this shit (for example if Netflix has to pay for "fastlanes", and they are using literally like 50% of the world's bandwidth, they are going to have pay up the ass. Netflix will get more expensive everywhere and/or have less stuff.) And Trump is threatening environmental issues on a scale so large that it will indeed effect the entire world. 
You remember the Jill Stein scam?
Some of the other executive orders has some weirdness around them to the effect that once something was protected it had to go through a review to "unprotect" it. So maybe the lack of that subsequent review is the issue?
A lot of Trumpolines seem to think that he's king of all he surveys and proceed to throw their toys out the pram when someone does their job and challenges him. We have a similar problem here in the UK, where the PM just said that voting against her in parliament was treason and the press just ran with it, that was all kinds of terrifying. 
They're a legal advocacy group that operates by filing lawsuits to advance a policy agenda.  If they're an environmental group, they almost certainly have some sort of policy on nuclear power.
Also where are these fusion reactions occurring? If you know how to safely and efficiently contain a fusion reaction please tell us.
No idea about OP, but there are organizations like Greenpeace, who are - somewhat paradoxically - against the energy source that would perfectly fit to their goal of preserving the environment.
Of course they are safer then by train.  These trains currently flood the midwest along the pipeline route.  The tracks and bridges they are on are some of the oldest in my state and the risk of spill is very high.   Also... the trains use more energy (diesel) to haul the oil then pipelines use electricity (wind power etc) to pump.   If you look at the train routes many cross the same river the pipeline does.   At least have some common sense in deciding what to sue trump on.
*muh feels deserve recognition and lawsuits.*
Because people who don't care about environmental causes have heard about the DAPL but not Trans-Pecos. This is about gaining media attention, not using donor dollars effectively and intelligently. 
Yes. Absolutely 
The nature of an environmental dispute can affect the number of people who have standing to sue.  For example, a mining proposal that would harm a place that only a few dedicated hikers visit might have a relatively small number of people with standing to sue over it.  On the other hand, a wide-ranging proposal to weaken protections for clean air might have a large community of air-breathers with standing to sue. 
He's an environmental lawyer he can't handle that pressure
That's exactly right.  The elders in Fort Yates simply wanted more money.  The oil flows over the river in trains already so the water issue is moot.
I laughed out loud at it too. 
Well he can really only help stop Trump from breaking laws.  Installing CEOs in government positions is not illegal as long as the usual process is followed.
He gives a great answer to this in another part of the AMA but bottom line, they're suing under the concept that natural resources are protected for the common good. Trump is shirking his duty as President to preserve natural resources (in some cases, clean water and air) for the American people and future Americans. That's explicitly part of his job and they're arguing that by rolling back regulations, allowing drilling, reducing budgets, removing information, etc. he's messing up his job to the point where he can be sued.
What are you implying?
You realize the only times they will be awarded attorney fees are when they win the case, in which case the blame for using taxpayer money is on the other party that performed an illegal act?
From what I can tell, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act enables Presidents to protect more areas by Executive Order but removing that protection requires an act of Congress.Makes sense when you think about it. The law makes it easier to protect lands than to remove that protection.
>It's perfectly legal for a president to... overturn executive orders. This point is partially incorrect; as pointed out by others, (simplified) only congress can reverse these environmental EOs. 
I mean yes, it's because he agrees with them.  If people didn't disagree with some things or agree is other things then nothing would ever happen.  What is your point?
It's complicated too. It's a political hot potato.
Funny that /u/FS4JQ is not the one giving thanks for this non-partisan approach.   Well, they've just been a redditor for 14 days, so maybe they're just not used to things yet.  Yeah, I'm sure that's it.
I don't really think there are that many actual shills around on either side of the spectrum lately. There were likely a lot back during the election and primaries, but not at this point. It's just strong supporters by now. And, yes, a lot of Trump supporters support the environment, they support climate change, they support social topics. In short, everything that Trump and his cabinet aren't. It's quite perplexing.
Remember when Billy Madison played the clarinet.   
Pretty much did the same thing when she requested the recall. The extra money not spent after the recall was counted is for her department to keep
Of course he can.  How d'you think the legal system works?  If he doesn't have some reason to believe this was illegal then there would be no basis for going to court.
its almost like the "good" guys just want to kick out the "bad" guys so they can become the new "hey guys were youre friends guys were not going to do anything bad at all we promise" guys
Nuclear reactors all over the world contain an ongoing fission reaction on a daily basis.
Don't forget Greenpeace's constant attacks on biotechnology, when the field is one of the main methods by which we will help the world deal with the agricultural effects climate change will be having. 
Trains are surprisingly light on fossil fuel usage.  Something in the range of 3 gallons per mile which is only about half of what an 18 wheeler consumes.  compare the weight they're pulling (7000 ft of cars) to a 53-foot aluminum box, it's a pretty efficient way of moving freight.Also, rail freight is down considerably YOY.Anyway - just pointing some things out.
How do you construct a wind turbine? Or produce batteries? Or charge your electric car? People seem to forget that physics still exists when it comes to 'clean' energy.
Isn't that the definition of using donor dollars effectively and intelligently though, since media exposure is usually what it takes to get things done?
When I die, just throw me in the trash.
I would really love to see a case like that.
The opinions people glean from a different perspective is the most beautiful thing on the planet. The fact he did not answer is very telling. 
why?  it's another way of saying "we're already heating up that area, we shouldn't heat it up more" - not exactly scientific but more than logicalit pretty much looks like you and /u/liamhogan are some retarded internet morons
My implication is that these foundations are well-funded private political agencies structured as charities both to avoid tax and scrutiny and also to arm themselves with the moral status genuine charities are ascribed in the US. Our country's political system is riddled with such agencies on both the right and the left. 
Their lawsuits aren't based on the idea that it's illegal for Trump to overturn Obama's EO's, it's that the policies he's implementing show an illegal disregard for the President's sworn duty to protect America, including its natural resources, for future generations.
Did you see his/her other comments? Just an insecure troll with a Napoleon complex.
Personal opinion, at least for guys like me. There are more pros than cons. I'll fight Trump on certain issues with environment and such because I'm not spending all my time trying to fight for my gun rights or whatever. Come for my guns and artic drilling well take a back seat. Just an example
I don't understand how his advisers cannot sit down and tell him how and why he will get sued, or he just doesn't care?
I think he's saying that Obama's protection of those certain areas was not done via executive order. It was done via powers granted by OCSLA, a law passed by congress. While the OSCLA gives the president power to protect, it doesn't give him power to "unprotect". So, because what Obama did wasn't an executive order, Trump can't legally repeal it by executive order alone.  
Because legally, the president can order the halt, but can't do the opposite via executive order. There are different channels he would need to go through, and he has ignored those.
She raised money saying she was going to challenge the election to help Hillary....instead she ran off with the money.
The fact that someone filed a lawsuit against Red Bull because it didn't literally give them wings, and then win said lawsuit, that should answer your question. 
Can't wait to fight the renewable lobby in the name of thorium or fusion!
When it rains where do you think that oil goes? Right back into the water systems.
A lot of the time in scenarios like that (automated system failure) it comes back to human involvement. Whether bypassing alarms (happens more than you'd think), installation failure or poor maintenance causing equipment failure. 
Please don't apply logic when they just want to shit on people for acting on things they believe in. /s
The body of the man found with the garbage was named Dank Frenelds. Do you know this man?
By this logic, Obama should have been sued in 2015 for not implementing the executive orders quicker.It really just comes down to "he's doing something we don't like but we'll frame it as a legal issue".
Has anyone seriously been coming for your guns though? Do you just have a bunch of assault rifles or something?
We all make mistakes. Even I did, at one time back in the nineties.
In the words of obama ,"so sue me".
Gotcha, it sounded like he was saying Obama unilaterally made the OSCLA protection....and that its okay for Obama to create it, but not okay for Trump to destroy it.
Something doesn't have to be illegal to be brought up in a civil proceeding.  You just have to have some kind of basis for claim.  I'm not a lawyer, but I imagine environmental suits would be easy to demonstrate a basis for, as you could show some kind of damages.Any lawyers care to chime in on more specifics?
basically already had that fight what 30 years ago now the plebians whine about nuclear at every turn. why people who dont know what theyre talking about have any influence or say ill never know
The volume of those leaks would be very different though. Even if everything from one truck would go into the water system, this is nowhere near the catastrophe a burst pipe would have.
And this is why people don't want it next to their water supply
Plus people here act like a lawyer can just capriciously "quit" a case. If you quit and it works harm to your clients you can be guilty of malpractice and face sanctions/discipline.
> infringes on basic human rights.How?
Could and should. You mixed those words up
Or, "I'll see you in court."
Well, he IS a lawyer with an agenda.
It is like my dad always told me, "if it doesn't make sense, it makes someone money."
Yeah for sure.Where I live there is a big fight over fracking for all of the same reasons.
Or, a more apt quote from The Killers, "This is the wooooorld that we live in, feel myself get tired.."
The stability of the system is still unclear, because it is a complex dynamical system, the planets' masses are not yet precisely determined, we don't know yet the orbital period of the 7th planet, and there could be more planets. More on this soon!
TRAPPIST-1 shows one flare (eruption) every week and a strong one every 6 months. Its X ray activity is not yet very well known and could be also a thread for any life there. But if the planets have an atmosphere and magnetic field this could limit the level of high energy flux. This is still work under investigation to estimate those levels.
to bounce off this: will SETI start listening to this system, now? 
We do not yet have a protocol. Most likely we will make a tentative discovery, that will take longer to confirm. SS
It's going to be awhile before we find an oxygen rich atmosphere. JWST launch in fall 2018, so we will have to wait to try until sometime after that. It turns out some oxygen-rich atmospheres might exist that are not created by life, so to associate oxygen will require care. I hope we will be able to find, identify, and announce in a few years! --SS
>  would they get slightly disrupted by passing other planets?Yes, they are!  It's this very fact that allowed for the measurement of the planet masses.  Due to gravitational perturbations between neighboring planets, the arrival times of the transits are not perfectly periodic.  They arrive slightly ahead of schedule or behind schedule by a few minutes up to nearly an hour in the most extreme cases.  The mass of planet f is particularly well-constrained by this method, called transiting timing variations.  - Natalie Batalha
We will look at the atmosphere for gases that do not belong--gases that might be attributed to life. We will not know if the gases are produced by microbial life or by intelligent alien species. --SS
Answer to first question: Determining the surface gravity requires knowledge of both the radius and mass.  The uncertainties on the mass measurements are large, but our best guess is that the surface gravity of most of these planets is similar to that on Earth.  One exception is planet f.  It has the same radius as Earth but 68% the mass.  That means the surface gravity will be 68% that of Earth. - Natalie Batalha 
All of them.  They are very, very close together  All are much closer to one another and to their host star than the Mars-Earth distance, for example.Michael Werner
Tidal-locking: we think as long as there is an atmosphere (even a thin atmosphere like that on Mars) heat will circulate around the planet. So habitability location should extend beyond the limbs.
not precisely because such little stars evolve very veryvery slowly ! they live for hundreds of billions years compare to 10 billions for our own Sun... we can say that it is older than 500 million years, but it could be several billions years and even older than our own system (4,7 Gyear)
Surface temperatures depend on the proximity to the central star but also on the composition and thickness of the planet's atmosphere.  Since we do not yet know anything about the planetary atmosphere's, all we can say is how much energy a planet is receiving from the star compared to how much energy Earth receives from the Sun.  However, because this planetary system is so nearby, scientists should be able to characterize the atmospheres with future instruments and observatories.  That's one reason why we're so excited about this discovery.  - Natalie Batalha
Not only that, but possibly even  magnetic, geological/volcanic, and other unforeseen effects too.
That would be a lovely idea.. With the TRAPPIST team, we were more considering using names of the few trappist beers ;) !J.d.W.
NASA's upcoming James Webb Telescope, launching in 2018, will take over with a much higher sensitivity. It will be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of water, methane, oxygen, ozone, and other components of a planet's atmosphere. Farisa Morales
The habitable zone is estimated based on the luminosity of the star and recognizing how far away can you be from it such that water can exist in it's liquid form on the surface of a terrestrial planet like the earth.  Too close and the water evaporates; too far and the water freezes solid.  Thus, the habitable zone is independent of whether the planets are tidally locked or not.  Farisa Morales
You're correct! Using the transit technique, we can only find the planets passing in front of their star from our perspective. And as not all planets are on aligned plans, not all planets can be detected with this technique. Fortunately, other techniques exist to help us detect non-transiting planets (e.g., radial-velocity, direct-imaging, and astrometry techniques, among others).J.d.W.
What is really important about these types of discoveries is that they are checked by other scientists and confirmed external to the original team this is called the peer review process and has to occur before any scientific work is made public, to make sure we are giving the best information available -HW
> the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation AquariusSeems like that might answer your question!
The 3 planets e, f and g are the so called habitable zone and are the best candidates to harbor liquid water and... maybe... life ! 
 Observations such as those described today require precision much higher than 1%.  At this level, we discovered in the initial data on exoplanets various "systematic effects" having to do with both the telescope and the instrument which made it difficult to achieve this level of performance.  So the re-engineering really meant using the telescope and analyzing the data in new and different ways; this continues as we strive to achieve higher and higher precision. - M. Wernersee spitzer.caltech.edu for more information.
JWST will be able to look at the atmospheres of these planets all the way out to the infrared looking for the carbon and oxygen-based species. This will give us better information about how thick the atmosphere is and what it is made up of, I.e. If it is condensed 100% water or carbon dioxide or something different. -NL
"a" is for the star main star. We start naming companions with "b" if it is a planet, with "B" if it is another star.J.d.W.
Very true! We have a very Earth-centric perspective on Life and habitability. But this is the beauty of exoplanetary science. We are exploring other worlds, finding unexpected planet types (e.g., hot-Jupiter, super-Earths), planets around completely different types of stars. All this is helping us broadening our perspective on planetary systems, which was based on a century-long study of our own system. Now, let's hope exoplanetary science will provide us with a similar perspective shift on habitability and Life--in the Universe!J.d.W.
Yes quite a few of us are.From the NASA HQ library, write a few people went for a big "YES!" to your question ;)J.d.W.
The first observations of the newly discovered planets are underway, as soon as the results successfully pass through the scientific peer review process we will be able to share what we are learning. Stay tuned this system has lots more exciting things to teach us. - HW
Hubble can't take images of these planets, but it can do something even better: take spectra. -- NL
The tidal interactions between the planets should be far from being strong enough to significantly raise their temperatures. 
We are currently making observations of some of these new planets, what is important is that these results go through the proper scientific process, I.e. Detailed and backed up analysis, and then peer review for publication. As soon as that happens the results will be available for the public. Stay tuned there is a lot we will be learning from TRAPPIST-1 for years to come - HW
>  What does it mean for us as human, in terms of how this could potentially benefit us? I am one of those who believe that even if they seem far from ordinary people, these discoveries tend to and usually will improve our lives.I've always believed that a deeper understanding of the universe leads to a deeper appreciation for life and its inter-connectedness -- and that ultimately, knowledge leads to greater empathy.  - Natalie Batalha
Kepler can observe for about 80 days consecutively and will therefore provide a very important time series and information on the gravitational interactions between the plaets which cause timing variations.  It is possible that there may be additional planets not seen by Spitzer in 20 days which Kepler could uncover.  Kepler and Spitzer have comparable capabilities for the detection of planets around the TRAPPIST-1 system.The Trappist planets are certainly among the first "cold Earths' to be candidates for further observations, and 1h in particularly will be the coldest.Michael werner
Venus and Mars are on the edges ! none of them are habitable and what a difference with planet Earth. Mars is too small and has not magnitic field so it lost its atmosphere and now it is too cold to keep liquid water on the surface. And Venus has such a thick atmosphere that there is a strong greenhouse effect and it is far too warm to keep running water.So the key is also the atmospheres of the planets... next step is to find them around T1 planets ! 
Our exoplanet search targets the 50 nearest Southern ultracool dwarf stars. TRAPPIST-1 was among them. M. Gillon
TRAPPIST-1 is a an ultracool dwarf star, the longest-lived stars of the Universe. It's lifetime should be much larger than 100 billions years. M. Gillon
Oh, Reddit. Considering the syntax of this classic question, I'd personally go with one Earth over a hundred. ;-) -- Stephanie
The Spitzer telescope points at the Trappist star.  The light from the star is imaged on to what is called an infrared array, a specialized and expensive version of your cell phone camera which works in the infrared.  The electronic signals from the camera, which contain the information about the brightness of the star, are stored on Spitzer and sent back to Earth, where they are analyzed electronically to determine the brightness.  This was done every two seconds for twenty days; the accumulated data was sent back every three days or so.  Michael Werner
In the Q&A section after the main part of the announcement, somebody asked the same question. The answer was that yes, SETI has been listening to the system, and no, they have not heard anything from it.
We don't know whether they are going clockwise or counterclockwise around the star.  However, we are quite sure they must all be going around in the same direction, as do the planets in our solar system; otherwise it would be quite unstable.  Michael Werner
>More on this soon!How do you define soon?
I noticed that one of the "goldilocks" planets, trappist-1f, has a radius just slightly larger than Earth, but only about 2/3 of our mass.  This seems like a significant difference to me, so I'm wondering what the implications are. Does this suggest it doesn't have an iron core? And would that suggest no magnetic field?  Also, would tidally locked planets be less likely to have a magnetic field?
they said in the announcement that SETI has been listening already
If you do find signs of life will it be a top priority to inform the public? 
How might an oxygen-rich atmosphere form in the absence of photosynthetic life?
You're searching for alien farts?
2030's seems like a long time away. What's the barrier to getting these telescopes sooner? Budgetary, engineering challenges?
Thanks! I wonder now if the more interesting question would have been: what would an astronomer on a TAPPIST exoplanet know about the Sol system, assuming they had our intelligence and equipment?Perhaps Venus and Mars would fall into Sol's habitable zone, and further investigation would be required to determine whether or not they are able to harbor life as we know it? I think Dr. Werner's reply is fascinating because it highlights not only how lucky we are to have discovered these exoplanets, but also how much more there is to know. 
>It has the same radius as Earth but 68% the mass. That means the surface gravity will be 68% lower than on Earth.Wouldn't it be 32% lower than Earth's gravity or 68% of Earth's gravity?
Do we have any idea how the human body would cope with 1.1g?Would it simply require 10% extra work (probably creating more fit people) or are there more complicated effects?
Is it correct to say, that if they are 40 light years away, they are now receiving our radio broadcasts from 1977 ?
Interesting. There would probably be some pretty massive winds going from a hot sun face to the cold dark face. I imagine it would be better to be in the penumbra anyways to have some solid ground between you and any big CMEs.
Are tidally locked planets likely to have an encompassing magnetic field?
>  they live for hundreds of billions years keeping in mind that the universe is only 12-14 billion years old. . . (and this star is not-likely 1st generation)
500 million and 40 *
Thank you for replying! Can you tell us a bit more about the amounts of energy the planets are receiving and what might be the impact?
Now imagine those same tides, but a thousand times larger AND the sea is literally lava.
This comment right here is definitive verification that this account comes from real astrophysicists ;)
Science news has managed to survive announcing discoveries on Uranus.
Is it likely that any of the TRAPPIST planets have a magnetic field? Can tidally locked planets have a magnetic field?
So what you're saying is that there's a real chance that we will be able to confirm or deny with a high probability the existence of life in the TRAPPIST-1 system next year. This is incredible.
It would be great to have a measurement/comparison of just how "goldilocks" a planet might be. So, for example, Earth might be 90% goldilocks, Mars might be 20% because it's closer to the edge of the zone, etc.
Just 40 light years lol. We better get busy with near light speed capabilities. 
So, a while, then?
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius! AQUARIUS! 
I will second this and so will my tattoos, my phone case, and my laptop case. - HW
but is there anything that we'll be able to see in the near future, that indicates how the planets would actually look from a human eye?
I completely meant this as a silly remark, and someone from NASA wrote me back. Ha! So cool.
Probably whenever they figure it out.
your tax dollars at work, people!
A shot of water would be fitting to celebrate it, right?
AFAIK we don't know of any other way which is why it's generally seen as such a strong indication of life. That being said, there could be something else that causes it that we simply haven't observed or discovered yet so it's best not to jump the gun. 
This is TRAPPIST-1 - hopefully they're alien beer bubbles.

Heard nice things, but what is the commute like?
Exercise physiology masters student here - great question! For short term, I believe it would just make people more fit. Imagine sedentary individuals going to the gym. They have strength gains far above 10% which the body handles just fine. The only issue I could really see is the heart having difficulties producing the pressure required to pump blood against the planet's gravitational pull across a whole lifetime. 
Man don't blow his wallets on pipe dreams, let's see what we can do to Mars while we wait for warp drives.
Just tell the goverment there is oil.
Less than 12 parsecs, guy. Show The Falcon the respect she deserves. 
We went from land based creatures to space explorers in less than 100; it seems exponential. I have hope.
But won't the spacecraft have reached even greater speeds in the distance between, reducing that time? 
Oh god they're getting our disco. If there's advanced life there no wonder they don't want to make contact.
But then you don't get any energy from photosynthesis.  Sticking in the light has major advantages.
My guess is that it's irrelevant. It's the planet's mass and size that determine if they have an active hot core generating a magnetic field, but I could be wrong. 
So how do we get 100 billion year lifespan estimate from something that can't be more than 14B?
boy you trying to correct NASA right now?
I'm going to have to pass. Unless... unless there are lava lobsters!!!
A full moon means the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun.  So all three objects are aligned, and their gravity is pulling along the same plane.
 We know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has a magnetic field, and it is tidally locked.
I think it's to do with the wavelengths of the light coming from them
in 20 years the big question won't be if life exists out there, but if intelligent life exists out there 
My great-grandchildren might be able to go there (maybe).That's pretty fucking rad. 
In the paper they wrote that the main data they used was collected by the Spitzer Space telescope 19 September to 10 October 2016. This isn't the first paper on this system, previous ones found multiple Earth-sized planets, so they looked closer with better telescopes last year and found many more transits. So, not that long, since the data analysis is non-trivial with this many planets.

You'll have to wait a few years for his response to get here.
So just like Dragonball Z but instead of reaching super saiyan 2, your heart just gives out?
Furthermore, getting to Mars is seen as a proof of concept/test for going further into space.
We want to observe it, not invade it.
Not sure a 1-hour 49-minute movie will keep you occupied for that long.
Or for *Mass Effect* to happen.
Then you need to deccelerate accordingly though.
Well, the response we're not receiving from them now is their reaction to what they saw 40 years ago. And that is the radio waves that left earth 80 years ago. In 1937... Definitely worse than disco. 
It's these trade offs that make me so jazzed to picture what kinds of crazy life forms might evolve on these planets.
They estimate that their fuel won't run out for 100 bn years. They don't have to observe a 100 bn year old star to make these predictions. This is the power of science. 
I dunno, Planet Spencer? 
Kind of a weird name for a monastery tbh
Yes, specifically the wavelengths absorbed by the atmosphere of the planet give a fingerprint for the chemical composition of the atmosphere. At least that's my understanding.
I don't think it's going to be so soon. 
Version 1 or Version 2?VR might help.
womp wompppp. doesn't mean much, though. could be pre-radio or post radio, or just not use radios. could be microscopic life in a puddle somewhere. who knows. 
But even if they find something, the fastest means of communication we know of would delay any sort of response to minimum 80 years. It's kind of depressing to think of it that way. :(
For the government to keep incontrovertible proof of alien life from the public it would have to be significantly more competent than it has demonstrated itself to be (I'm talking long term). In addition, it would require that no one - NO ONE - who knew and had access wouldn't blow the whistle. Those in government are still in the end just humans and human nature suggests someone would feel compelled to let the word out.

That feeling you get when you realize 2030 is closer  to now than 2000.... :(
I'm neither an astronomer nor a politician, so I honestly don't know...But honestly one of the biggest hurdles has to just be *need*. NASA doesn't need to spend another 9 billion on a telescope to succeed the JWST for another 20+ years, when the comparatively ancient Hubble is still turning in *incredible* findings.Of course, if you pump a bajillion dollars into NASA they could be doing more of this, but remember, they do a lot of other stuff too. 
It used to say that. Source: Black electrical tape. 
Now I dont feel so bad about the test I just bombed!
Pickup line : "Hey baby, i once corrected a NASA engineer."
Haven't watched Dragonball Z so I don't understand the reference, but yes the heart would probably be more likely to fail earlier than it would under Earth's gravity. 
Well last time we tried mars, Mark Watney almost died. 
I kinda wanna invade it
We can probably track and predict the paths of large celestial objects sufficiently enough to avoid them but I can't imagine wanting to take a trip on a craft that can be shredded by a little bit of space dust.So we can add some sort of future-tech shield system to the list of things we need before hitting up our cosmic neighbors for a cup of sugar.

If such intelligent life is capable of receiving radio then they probably would transmit it too, which would have been been picked up by now. I don't think anyone is expecting to find any type of intelligent life on these planets.
I used to think the government could hide the existence of aliens like in the X-Files. Then I saw what happened during hurricane katrina and realized the government can't do shit.

Yeah, fiction has us as the defending species, but we should grab the galaxy by the balls and just start invading 
Would a hypothetical Alcubierre drive solve that? Since space is bending around the ship a possible rogue space rock would never actually touch it.

We are literally talking to NASA right now, and you choose to talk about your genitals.  The future is strange.
Well to be fair there would be a long delay in time for them to receive our message all the way from Earth and then we would need to wait a long time to hear a response back. And anyway, even if it isn't intelligent, any extraterrestrial life would be monumentally important 
I'm not American so I don't keep an eye on those things, but I'm interested in that.  Can you tell me what happened?

Underrated "pence is scum" joke
Then : "Hey baby, wanna see my Lamborghini ? I also have a garage full of books."
Is this from a thing I should've watched already?
>grab the galaxy by the pussyFTFY
One of the potential problems with an alcubbierre drive is that it could collect the space debris it passes through and release it all at near light speed when the ship stops. Your ship will be fine but the planet you were trying to get to just went the way of Alderaan.
Okay, I know this is a joke, but there is no way you could finish a game of Civ in only 160,000 years.
Only to discover they are classified merely because someone did something so stupid that its just too embarrassing to share with the public.

I think we can put an end to CISA for good. We just need to kill it so bad that it becomes toxic and no one in Congress wants to go anywhere near it ever again. That's what happened to SOPA, so we know it's possible. The companies behind this would no doubt continue to try to sneak it through in some other form, but making Congress afraid to touch CISA or similar bills would be a huge step in the right direction.
Also, it's many of the companies that seem to know the least or are the most reckless about privacy and security -- Chamber of Commerce, banks, Target, Experian. The Chamber themselves are the ones that lobbied to take out real cybersecurity measures like having good security, and helped to create this bill that goes beyond strict cyberthreat data sharing to expansive info-sharing with 7 federal agencies for more than just cybersecurity purposes. 
>One of the questions the aides asked me was, which cybersecurity bill do I recommend my senator support instead?What a ridiculously condescending question to be asked. Tell your Senator that a voting against CISA does not require her to vote for something else.
1) Because the best way to kill a company is to push politics at people who aren't there for politics, and 2) Twitter is not a person, it's a corporation, filled with shareholders with different opinions. It's one thing to have an official stance on something, it's another thing to start using resources to push a political point of view.Everyone hates when corporations use their muscle to push political views -- except evidently when they push something someone agrees with.
Because people change their opinions, and not every piece of legislation introduced is evil. Where would we be if, for example, marriage equality was brought once 10 years ago, shot down, and never talked about again?
Why blame reddit? The rest of the media has given it even less coverage.It's almost like they *all benefit from having every citizen constantly surveilled.*

Yes, it will affect Canadians and everyone else, in some ways worse. The law encourages the capture of data, regardless of whether its from the U.S. or elsewhere. Lots of it will flow to U.S. companies, or through the U.S..Since you're not a U.S. person (we need a better term for that, if anyone has ideas) the U.S. government already cares less. There are a few weak protections for data from the U.S., and a few more will be written, but those won't apply.
Because each time its going to get closer.  We are going to get tired of emailing eventually.  Read the comments, people are already tired of it.  Multiple comments complain about the amount of emails and how they ignore them or unsubscribed.  At some point, probably now, it will pass because Congress is both bought and not technologically savvy to really understand what this bill means/doesn't care.  
Note that bills like Marijuana legalization and gay marriage would suffer from this as well. 
Ask him if, in his opinion, proposed "cybersecurity" legislation like CISA would have had any chance of prevent the major security incidents that we've seen over the past few years - the Target, Sony, OPM breaches for example. I believe you'll find his answer enlightening (spoiler: it wouldn't have done anything!)
This is a great question. We have to be vigilant. We need to look for these policies from the very beginning and start to speak out as soon as they are being discussed. Let's all work together to weigh in early and often.
The likelihood is greater if we don't fight back. And even if they do pass it, we're going to make them pass a "surveillance bill". They won't get to sneak it through and pretend it is non-controversial. (Which by the way, they used to claim this bill was non-controversial all the time.)
Imagine how much worse it'll get for you if the bill passes
It is the last chance in the sense that the Senate will be voting on the bill tomorrow. The House has already approved its own versions and then it'll go through conference process on its way for signature by the President. This is the last chance in that if we don't stop it now it will become law.
It may not seem like it, but we win a lot. We won on SOPA/PIPA, we won on Net Neutrality, not everyone like USA FREEDOM Act but it was the first time the government attempted to limit surveillance in a generation. This bill is the most hydra of them all, but even this bill we've beaten over and over again. The motivation is that we can actually be effective.
CISA specifically exempts itself from FOIA, so it will be impossible to know what's being shared and what personal information is included. That will make it much more difficult to challenge through the courts. 
The Senate voted on a procedural vote to advance the bill (called a Cloture vote). It will then have more votes on amendments to the bill, and a final vote on the actual bill. 
Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein have been leading the effort in support of the bill.
How about something like this?: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."
The EFF has lawyers and everything on their payroll and has taken up fights in courts together with other similar organization.I wouldn't say your money is badly spent by using them on the EFF.
I've used reddit for several years now and I don't really notice it. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, but that it's fairly non-obtrusive at least to me - a casual. For example, taking "offensive" content off the front page -- I don't really notice that it's gone in my day-to-day scrolling. The speed at which the front page refreshed has been more noticeable to me.  
> Who has a plan to stop this shit from coming back ever 4 months? 4 months is another lifetime in Washington. The bill is set to pass tomorrow.
Because they are properly bribed.
Probably something along the lines of they publicly oppose it but are paying lobbying groups to go lobby against it for them.
Elaborate?
You have two senators, so try the other one?
Why is there reluctance from Google to lend their weight to these causes?  Not as immediately business-destroying dire as SOPA/PIPA?
Too bad we only get to do that every few years.
> the companies that seem to know the least or are the most reckless about privacy and security -- Chamber of Commerce, **banks**, Target, **Experian**Shouldn't this worry everyone immensely?  That these guys know the least about, or are most reckless about, security??
The way it sounded to me wasn't that the aide or my senator were going to ignore my call if I didn't give them a good answer. It sounded to me instead like they understood I cared about the issue and wanted to know whether I only wanted my senator to oppose the bill, or if I had more thoughts to share.I do think my message will be stronger when I call back tomorrow letting my senator know which bills to support now, though.
Yep.  These people want to press a magic one-time button and all problems go away forever.  That ain't how it works, kids.  You have to stay alert and involved, *forever*.  Or the assholes will run you when you're not looking.
I have a gmail account I use only for spam for situations like this.
That's why the government always win. Most people only care until they have something better to do.
I believe what he is trying to say is that since twitter is opposing the bill, why doesn't he see more negative press about it in the twitter news feed and moments. 
I agree, it seems that the level of precision that people desire is not something that could be written into law very easily. Some issues should be brought up again because they are worth fighting for and others just need to go away. But there's no way of easily distinguishing between the two.
The reason laws only get deemed unconstitutional *after* they are passed is because the Judicial power, not the Legislative, deems them so. If the Judicial power were to intervene in lawmaking and deem a bill unconstitutional while it was still in Congress, then that would be an infringement on the checks and balances between the three powers (thus also unconstitutional).
Is this insinuating that every other representative is actively for CISA or are there some that are just not actively against it.
>not a U.S. person (we need a better term for that, if anyone has ideas)Someone from the US: American, US citizenSomeone not from the US:  non-american, foreignerOr am I misinterpreting the question, maybe?
Good point. A double edged sword.
Icing on the cake: surveillance has a chilling effect on speech. Knowing your information could end up being shared with the government, without a warrant, may change what you're willing to say publicly.
I think the idea is that the government can use this information to thwart terrorism and such. Again no proof that the over surveillance of all citizens is the an effective way to go about it.  
Oh, or about this one: "If China had the exact same capabilities as the United States, would you ask your children to change their personal behavior?"
Man, you people are worse than the politicians at giving non-answers to direct questions.
Necessary work, unless we want more leaks like Target.
Would you prefer to be called President George W. Cook?
Cybersecurity information sharing act exempts itself from freedom of information act? How is that even legal? They want info on us but we cant get info on them?
You should be mentioning this on Twitter. Post the original message again and add them.
When I worked on the hill they gave a lot of good informational Q and A sessions to staffers. EFF does it's fair share of educating in DC. Too bad staffers can't step between lawmakers and lobbyists. 
Because Google is most likely pro-CISA.They were pro-CISPA as well, but found out the hard way last time that they need to stay quiet about that fact to avoid damaging the misplaced trust many have in them.
yup, until we start calling the bills by an acronym describing what they're all trying to do, so we can say "IT'S ANOTHER #### BILL! GET IT!!!"This removes the tool of cognitive distraction/differentiation of "but this bill is completely different, and it has a different name!"It will make the toxicity mentioned by the OP easier to pull off, give all the toxic a name, and attach it to other toxic to make the whole field of bills in the image of the abyss toxic.
someone (PLEASE) correct me if I'm wrong, but by my reading of it it seems like like the Nations agreeing to SOPA like information sharing/rules are the nations of the Asia-Pacific region, not North American countries (that appears to be by design). i.e. APAC shares -> NA but limited or non existent NA shares -> APAC.
>Can't we all lobby for it? Just like the big shitty companies? And why aren't we voting for congress reps and shaming the ones who vote against our interests?Hell yeah man, let's do it. Okay, first, inventory. What are the resources at play here? The big shitty companies have a functionally infinite amount of money. We have... shit, well, somebody bought the top comment reddit gold, I guess that's a start. Maybe we could set up a kickstarter or something? I'm sure we can compete against *99% of the nation's wealth* if we really try, right guys?
If I perform badly at my job my boss can come in tomorrow or even call me tonight and tell me I'm fired. We should be able to do the same.
Really would be great if we had another Wikipedia (SOPA) blackout day or the like.  I know these companies fear becoming political, but they are already in the game and they really have to stand up for privacy + people if they want to our business longterm.I'd switch off gmail in a heartbeat if there was an equally powerful alternative that didn't data mine.  I'm already off google (duckduckgo) so that is my ad info they are losing out on already.
Bitch Mconnel? That bastard. Haha but seriously, you get one out another just fills in the gap and is just as corrupt. We need to attack the corruption, Get the Money out of politics! Wolf-pac.com
This sort of makes you question whether they're really looking at things in an unbiased way too. I mean do they want to kill every piece of Legislation that has anything to do with the internet, or are they looking at it objectively in what harm it could do? Because we do have real cybersecurity issues.
Yeah, especially when they put your first fucking name in it.  "[SUBJECT NAME HERE], I can't take this anymore."  Thought I was getting broken up with or something the first couple times.
They're a special interest group. The hard reality is that very few people would support all of their positions on every issue.
Some people feel like it's the most seamless (not annoying) way for them to take action, it could be the most efficient way too -- see a notification, look at it, click to take action in one spot. It also means we don't have to depend on so many gatekeepers -- facebook, gmail, commercial email ISP's, etc. That said, we're wary of making something unnecessary and doing this in a lightweight way. 
And they made this post as a call to action about a specific issue and the top comment thread is about their horrible email practices. Can they not see how ineffective this makes them look? 
This is not an accurate translation. Come on!
"The 501(c)3 who cried SOPA"
I even settle for weekly on some email lists. Anything more is overkill and instant unsubscribe though in 99% of cases. 
What time frame is more appropriate than *every time the lobbyists pull shit*?
This! My email account for spam is a lifesaver. 
Oh good point. I wish they'd do more. Do you have suggestions for how we can compel them to put more skin in the game?
Which is why it shouldn't be just an end all be all kind of restriction. There should be multiple ways of judging a bill and the criteria for legislation that cannot be reintroduced should be both strictly and defined and also flexible should the system be abused. It's not an easy thing to develop I'd imagine.
> considering how watch dog places like reddit are, potential hacking would be caught and the result voided.The reddit detectives are on the case.We caught the Boston Bomber, guys!
Especially because "worth fighting for" and "need to go away" are probably applied to the same thing all the time, depending on where you fall in your political views. 
I think this is a good idea. Once per session seems appropriate.
a rule like that could be so abused so badly...
Prosecuted? That seems harsh. 
These are the ones who made a difficult vote against CISA last week. Others voted to move the bill forward which could be a vote of support or not. (It was a procedural vote.)
Yeah as someone who has voted primarily liberal, I loved the shit out of Ron Paul. 
Clearly we need harsh penalties for failed legislation.
Or better yet, (I have no qualifications of any kind, so take this with a grain of salt), "If I was the director of the NSA, and you were some average Joe, knowing what you know now, would you be afraid?"
I don't think anyone can give you an honest answer to that question.  84 senators did vote to begin consideration of the bill, but I don't count that as 84 senators support it, but that 84 senators want to have a discussion about cybersecurity (which is a good thing). I do know that when it was passed in committee it passed 14-1 and they called in non-controversial. Now we have millions of faxes, tweets, calls, and emails.... No one calls it non-controversial anymore. So the honest answer -- at least from me -- is the the chances are greater if we do nothing.
I think Sir William George is a better fit, but A for trying (no standardized testing needed, Mr./MS. Footed).
What do you mean how is it legal? They're both Acts of Congress. One act can specifically remove provisions of another or limit another or anything it wants really. If it couldn't, you wouldn't ever be able to get rid of a bad law that was already on the books. The concept of "legality" comes from laws, if you pass a law saying it's legal, it's legal. 
Why would they be pro cispa?
how about a SHIT bill - Sifting Hoards of Intelligence Tyranically
Copyright = Bullyright
Yeah I've always thought that that is the major flaw in a democratic government. The lawmaker can fuck up for years and the only "penalty" the people can inflict upon him/her is not re-electing him/her, boohoo. There should be some kind of mechanism to keep congressmen in line while they are in office, now as to what that mechanism should be...pretty hard to come up an idea that isn't over-reaching.
And while it's not really a huge dent for them because of their size and market cap, I did read somewhere that google values each of their users somewhere around $250 each. So if more and more of their user base starts abandoning them as a result of the data mining it will eventually have an impact. 
The majority of people don't give a shit and will keep using Google services regardless.
Realistically it doesn't make sense for google to say anything regardless of their stance on it, considering all the different industries they're trying to get a foot in the door in.
Yeah, IIRC they even started dropping names. Dont remember which since i barely glanced at them, but it was basically "we dont support X politician, and they want to take away your rights!"
actually EFF has options for this on their email newsletter. I am signed up for monthly I believe, but you can also choose "action alerts" as well as more frequent emails.
Given the power of social media, has consideration been given to starting with a simple Facebook plugin?It won't help if the titles are clickbait, tho. That's the biggest thing.
Cut the politispeak. You're supposed to be better than the other guys.
Weekly and *predictable*.If I'm getting random mail the sky better be falling.
Pretty sure this is his son, Rand Paul though.The appeal of an honest not bought out corrupt inconsistent politician crosses partisan boundaries I believe. So i totally get where you're coming from
it's a tricky subject, however. Often bills with meaning will get gutted when going through legislation, so the people who originally lobbied/worked for the bill will just try again until they get it through with minimal bullshit (like free riders or becoming a "christmas tree" Bill."
I keep hearing this, but I haven't seen a single press release from Google on this subject.
They just have to change the name and the wording slightly.
I second this motion. SHIT bill. Has a nice ring to it. Kinda like holding a one pound hammer. Feels right.SHIT bill. Mmm.
down to 1630 last time I checked. So close.
I heard it was closer to $500.  And ya that means 100 people puts them out $25,000-$50,000... not peanuts.  Really I use DuckDuckGo because it is much more powerful than Google Search once you start using !bangs.  By letting you bypass them (and their own adverts entirely using !bangs) they've made me a very loyal customer.  And if you want to see what google results are just !g and you are there anyway haha.
But goddam gmail is fanstastic... I like their new tab thing and the spam filter (I get an inordinate amount of spam), and its easy to manage a few accounts from one interface.  I'm not tech savy enough to DIY that even when I've been the defacto (untrained) *IT Guy* for a small company before.
If you can add customized email settings, would it be possible for users to subscribe/unsubscribe particular areas of interest?
> has consideration been given to starting with a simple Facebook plugin?EFF? Faceboook?How?
You can make it not ding. 
They're not exactly crying wolf though. They need to find a balance between the human limits to responding to complex socio-legal issues (call that political engagement burnout) and the rate at which these issues need to be addressed by a call to action, in order to be effectively responded to. (Rate of political response).At the end of the day, remember they're asking you to respond because they believe you will recognise that it's in your best interests, that these laws present a genuine challenge to your freedom. 
They're called riders, and without them, a lot of legislation wouldn't go through at all. The senators put those riders in to be like, ok you want these laws passed? Well I want these laws passed too. I'm not sure how it gets to the point where they can't just be separate laws, but legislation is very time consuming, so there's that.
How does one enforce something like that?  Does an outside body have to okay if before it comes to a vote?
Well we'd need the content of the bill split up when it is not passed into the smallest possible segments and have each of those segments tracked and not allowed to be re-introduced as part of another bill for some time period.Bonus: maybe legislators will stop putting 10 million fucking things in a single bill in case it doesn't pass and they can vote on individual issues as opposed to shit in a package
So, half my essays in high school?
It's because voters don't care what the people they elect to do actually do once they get to Washington. People only care about politics during an election year then they care about more important stuff like how many karats is the engagement ring which Kanye gave to Kim Kardashian. 
The shit bills are floating Randy...
Over 99,000 now... Let's bump this
(also it's made by the eff :D )
yeah, we'd like to offer this soon. 
I bet many EFF supporters still use Facebook. 
They have two separate companies now IIRC. One that handles USA, and the other that handles the rest of the world. I'm not a lawyer or tax professional, but if they only moved part of the business and kept the company headquarters on USA territory, I believe they are still liable for taxes in the USA. 
probably suit
Turnitin.com/bills
Enforcement of that would very quickly become another political tool by which to kill a given bill.
Offer it sooner.
The EFF Facebook page has 134K likes as of now.
That gives me an idea
Maybe high school mentality is just really effective
Kill it every two years? If they can successfully do that, they can do it without any exploitation. I mean, the bills *we* want don't get introduced every other month.
I really hope that turns into something. It would be interesting to see what kind of idea it gave you.
according to current results, not particularly
I mean that it becomes possible to kill *any* bill by finding a way to argue it's too similar to one that got killed last month.
I have a recurring dream that I am back working on Burnout 3. Normally that I'm playing the game, and we've made it so every race ends with a crash junction. Then I wake up in a cold sweat. Games dev does things to you.
Sony has been super cool to work with, but mainly just because they haven't been involved in development, you know? We're still sort of the underdog with Sony, and in the general AAA (for obvious reasons). If NMS is a success, I think that probably will have a real impact in terms of how a lot of people in larger publishers view indie games. People generally think of NMS as a Sony title, but we're still just a self funded indie studio - it's kind of a crazy situation :)
PS4 and PC players are using two different servers. We are running a control experiment to see who names things the most juvenile things... Let the games begin!
Some of the team read it for sure, and then post me the weirdest stuff :) OK sso I'll admit there have been times, my lowest on the project, where I've looked at the subreddit and it's cheered me up and kept me going. But there have been times I've looked on there and despaired - and just thought "how can we ever live up to the expectations of people who having been waiting for this game for 3 years"
Yeah, so everyone thinks we were high or drunk :(Just hadn't eaten today, and am operating on zero sleep. It's an ok buzz. 5/10. Would not sleep again.
Control the spice, control the universe.
Cue frantic work on another patch!
So basically my beard is a disguise. I'm totally going to shave it off when this game is done, and burn every check shirt I own (5?) and hopefully no one will ever shout "No Man's Sky FOV Slider?" at me in the street. ever. again. in. my. life.
Sure... where we going?
Simulation theory is pretty much confirmed. Fuck this world I'm gonna go live inside the No Mans Sky universe. 
It could be for sure. We were talking today about just having a twitter bot that tweets discovery names at random. We've just been glued to the screen all day, watching names come in. Game isn't out... but we had like 160k discoveries uploaded today... so... :o
So Elon Musk asked me this (NAME DROP!). I said if I was Elon Musk, then I'd be pretty sure it was right? Like load up the holodeck with the disk where I get to colonise mars and make self driving cars... So I think he almost certainly is, and then I'm an AI bot I guess? In his simulation? Controlled by a giant AI that's smirking to itself whilst I give this answer....
This excites me. I want to build a zoo. Why build a base if you cant shove it full of insane creatures :|
Didn't he release a trailer for the game and then after the flood he said he would have cancelled the game if the trailer wasn't out?
We have found TotalBiscuit's Reddit account. 
The reality is that we're still here working on it right now. There's no conspiracy, we're just racing to get all the extra options and stuff we want. PS4 comes out tomorrow and we'll just try to pretend it's a normal work day! Best guess right now is 6pm GMT on Friday, but we'll keep you up to date as we get closer.
Initially I think we'll all be supporting NMS. But there are other ideas we've got rattling around in our heads too. I think video games is just such a largely unexplored field. There's very few studios that pull off the two game thing, but supporting one game and then kicking off something new - that's doable right?Sh*t, I just remembered, we've got another thing we're already working on that's unannounced. It's a small experiment, but hopefully you all might like it :)Maybe we can be the Johnny Depp of studios :D - do a mixture of big stuff and indie stuff? :D
Nice try, Genicap.

I know you're trying to prove a point and everything, but I would love being the best con artist of the 21st Century tbh.
I'm in the UK and came here to say the same thing to Sean. I decide every 2 months what game to buy because money is tight so i have to prioritise. Not so long ago I made the stupid decision of believing Sean's bullshit. I hope you can't sleep at night you dirty lying thief. I bought digital so I can't even trade in for pennies. Fuck you HG

Everything
Why would you burn it when you could've sold it? 
If not full multi-player, are you at least considering ways for you to "find your friends" in-game?
you mean disappointed that they spent $60 or more on a shitty game that was sold to them on lies?
I **REALLY** hope he answers this one
He has stated on previous interviews that there would not be gas giants. 
he said there was, but like a dozen other things, he lied
This is the question I want answered the most.  I'm pretty sure they've said it was TECHNICALLY possible in the past, just that it's next to impossible due to the size of the universe in the game, but the way they keep saying things now leads me to believe that it's just absolutely not possible and the functionality isn't in the game at all.
Wait, wait. You sent them cupcakes in June, I assume near the time they announced the delay and got flooded with death threats?

I, for one, welcome our new Sean overlord.
Found the MGSV fan
He said they probably would have cancelled the game if the trailer wasn't shown and there wasn't such a positive response. They actually asked Geoff Keighley to pull it from the show last minute, but he insisted on leaving it because he believed in the game and fought really hard to get them the spot on stage.
Total Biscuit would not pre order 
I'll tell you a funny story about PC. I was here late yesterday, and I had to take a break and do an interview with Playboy (!) - and the guy was like "what are you working on when you go back downstairs?" and I was like "compatibility for ATI opengl drivers", and he said "ummm.... could you make something up. That sounds pretty nerdy". I always knew I wasn't Playboy article material :)
NO MANS JOE DANGER CONFIRMED
Does anyone know how this issue with genicap was ultimately solved? I saw Sean's statement that the game doesn't use the super formula but have seen loaded articles claiming that it's been starred in the past that does.

No Mans Sky to Wii U, confirmed.
I honestly don't think I could be able to sleep at night if I was the biggest con artist of the 21st century.

You do know that 45mil is going back as steam/amazon/sony are offering refunds for any amount of hours.
Perhaps he's an honest person? How could he *sell* something that's worth nothing?
Late to the party, but he said> digital *or* physical piece of content
I remember in some old interviews, Sean had said you could see where your friends were on the Galaxy Map... I haven't watched the recent footage, so dunno if that's still true or not. I hope so.
He means because they lost sleep after paying that much.
Darn... what I really liked about previous space exploration games like NOCTIS is that it had all these barren planets and other planet types, but I guess I can't have it all.
I meeeaaannnn, rocket league. 
So good at wasting our time!We are the lazy generation!We are the lazy generation, now!!

I'm with you there. One of my favourite things about Minecraft was just being able to pop my headphones on, chill the fuck out, and explore a procedurally generated world.

Two thousand players each scanning 80 plants, animals, planets or systems... not that hard. I would not be surprised if their infrastructure has reliability issues during launch and after.

What if all of our names just mean Dickbutt in their language, we're just too intellectually meager to grasp it.
Never played it, can I build a zoo??
This is exactly why Im going to support it. Only indie studios have the balls to do anything risky rather than mining a franchise to death like EA, Activision, Ubisoft are known to do. I'd rather put the $40 toward an indie studio and risk getting shit than supporting more cookie cutter rinse and repeat games coming out.

Not only that, but calling them an indie dev is all part of the marketing.  
You can polish a turd with enough marketing and have a successful launch.  
Part of the new patch, feeding animals can lead to being friendly with them, them showing you where valuable resources can be found, can turn into your pets, and even shit out resources for you for feeding them.
AAA or Triple A games are the big budget mainstream games like Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto 5 and other games like that that take 100s of people and 10s of millions of dollars to create. Think of it like, AAA games are big budget summer blockbuster movies, and indie games like No Man's Sky and other smaller scale games are those little indie movies no one ever sees but get nominated for Oscars.

Sony Mario kart!! Loved that game
Its similar with movies, on the plus side - this is the reason Independent Game Studios can exist - they can pull out a great game with guerrilla marketing and make a fine profit (best example is probably early minecraft)
That's true.But having a successful launch isn't what really matters... What matters is how successful they keep on being during the life of the game.Remember that even WoW took 6 years to reach it's peak.If Hello Games keeps adding content, and refining what already exists, I can see NMS becoming something really big.Time will tell.

Oh we hang out all the time. He comes by The Planetary Society; we talk about the cosmos and our place in space.
Not my choice. Please ask the Disneynians to refresh the ride. It was a fun job. It was sponsored by Exxon, while they still owned a division that made bearings for wind turbine generators, and before their climate denial documents from 1977 were discovered and published in the New York Times. I'd love to do a new show though.
You and I are made of the same material as the stars. We are star dust. Therefore, you and I are at least one way that the universe knows itself. Cue the spooky music.
He and is companies are shaking things up in a great way. Some disclosure, he served on the Board of The Planetary Society for a while, but has had to recuse himself as SpaceX became Yuge. (I gave him a ride to the airport once.) The Tesla outperforms conventional gas-powered cars (as does my new all-electric Chevy Bolt). If the reused lower stage of the Falcon rockets proves profitable, it will change space exploration in great way. Go Elon! (He's an immigrant to the U.S., bt-dubs.)
He answered below.>Nope. When you get your job as a dancer on broadway, don't ever tell people who your favorite dance partner is. Otherwise, you won't get a chance to dance with anyone else. There is something in every episode that I just love. The spit take in Ocean Life cracks me up as does the screaming skull I'm holding in Bones & Muscles. And, who doesn't love passing out in a fighter plane pulling 7.5 g's?
Self-driving vehicles seem to me to be the next Big Thing. Think of all the drivers, who will be able to do something more challenging and productive with their work day. They could be erecting wind turbines, installing photovoltaic panels, and running distributed grid power lines. Woo hoo!
The quality of life for people everywhere will go down. There will be less food and less clean water available in the developed and the developing world. It's reasonable that this will lead to conflict: more violence, more war. Here in the super-developed US, people will have to abandon homes in Miami, Galveston, Norfolk, and other coastal towns. It will lead to defaulted mortgages and people looking for jobs inland. Where will those jobs come from? Sooner we get to work the better.
Infinitesimal. If you think you want to live on Mars, try living in the dry valleys of Antarctica for a few years. And to play fair, you have to bring your own air to breathe. Inhaling the local atmosphere on Mars would kill you in an instant. You'd never go outside, not really. You'd live in some dome, and when you go out, you have to be in a spacesuit, which is just another dome, only really tight fitting. Oh, and there is absolutely nothing to eat.
Nope. When you get your job as a dancer on broadway, don't ever tell people who your favorite dance partner is. Otherwise, you won't get a chance to dance with anyone else. There is something in every episode that I just love. The spit take in Ocean Life cracks me up as does the screaming skull I'm holding in Bones & Muscles. And, who doesn't love passing out in a fighter plane pulling 7.5 g's?
Thanks for your support. I don't have a favorite (favourite). Saturn is beautiful. And, I am fond of the Earth's Moon.
People seem to afraid of politicizing science a lot lately. I agree to an extent - science should not be a political issue as it is really just our best gauge of reality. However, in recent decades, science has been under attack and forced into being a political issue. It is not our choice whether or not this happens, it's happened already.Our best course of action is to defend science since it is constantly under attack by ignorance, closed-mindedness, and bull-headed paranoia. It's very important that we defend science.
Plant-based diets are the future. I look forward to food preparations that are not "derivative bits," as we say in comedy writing. Instead of "coconut bacon," for example, I hope there is just delicious stand-alone coconut preparations. Cooking is a competitive business. I look forward to the emergence of new plant-based dishes.
Check out Nick Graham. com. Consider buying our ties!
I hope people coming of age have a respect for the process of science in part because of my show(s). If not, I guess I've failed, but I did and continue to do my best. Checkout Bill Nye Saves The World, which starts on Friday on Netflix. There are 13 episodes. Binge 'em, and turn it up loud!
Favorite element? Don't have one, but I am fond of the compound water. In fact, now that I've sipped it, I don't think I could live without it. Subatomic particle? Not sure, but I'd sure like to know if there are particles associated with dark matter. Darkons?
Stargate.  
Pick up trash. Especially around water sources. Although to be honest I'm not sure if that'll help climate change. But it'll help something :)
I would also really like Mr. Nyes input on this, I'm sure he would be hesitant given he is a bit of a role model who influences young people intrested in pursuing a career in science, but nevertheless I am really intrested in what his take on it is.

Yes, I sure wish he would answer this for my students.. It would be so cool to hear back- especially since I am consistently using Bill Nye episodes and labs to teach science!
Probably because a lot of folks remember him for it, making it his crowning achievement. The guy is brilliant with lots of influence, but can be dismissed by peers as the "kids show scientist".At least until all the older scientist retire and the only ones left are the generations that grew up with Bill!

How do you plan to reach out to those in rural or underdeveloped communities in the nation and worldwide to educate them on conservation? Despite the fact that corporations and companies are the biggest polluters, things change when millions of people decide to put a common cause above the individual selves.
>You'd never go outside, not really.Awesome, so I wouldn't have to make any major lifestyle change!
That is an excellent answer.
You spelled it both ways you absolute fucking gent!
Except that based on tweets from the people running the event they aren't limiting it to politicizing science. They are trying tack on other causes and include them in the umbrella of science.

Thank you Bill for the reply! I've always been good with Mathematics; it's comforting to know it will help! I currently do freelance work as a writer for supplementary income and because it is fun! I'll have to talk with some of my connections who are television and screen writers; thank you again for the tip! 
This does not actually really help with global warming. The amount of CO2 produced in the making of plastic is overshadowed by the amount of CO2 produced by transportation, powering electronics, heating homes, etc. By all means you should recycle it has positive affects elsewhere but just not for helping global warming.

It's oddly fun to say out loud if your friends won't judge you (They will) but at least you can now say Bill Nye says it that way. (BT-dubs, they'll still totally judge you.)
I can't believe someone would just sell out like that. It's giving me a headache, I'm going to need a Nuprin... little, yellow, different.

*deep voice* Bill Nye the Science Guy
Doing what people like Bill Neil and NDT do is so important for the sciences, even if the die hard scientists look down on it. Getting children and the general public excited about sciences, and putting things in terms that laymen and children can understand is the best way to foster future scientists. The more people are interested in science the more scientists we will have, and they will receive more funding if the public understand that what they are doing is valuable.

So, I've always wanted to be a truck driver, haven't gotten a CDL yet, how fucked do you think my dream is?
Yeah, what a disappointing response. "Hooray! These advancements theoretically could lead to improvement in quality of life for all, but due to the death of the social contract will in fact lead to worse livelihoods for everyone except a select few who accumulate greater profits!"  /u/sundialbill do you have any thoughts at all on the need for **policies**, and not just technologies, that can help us reach the utopian vision you lay out?   Someone with your cultural cachet could help to make this dialogue more mainstream.
Well, there plenty of room for SOME work. So many people work 40-80 hours a week and that's just ridiculous but completely necessary when your getting paid next to nothing why don't we spread the load and the resources?

Politicians like to hold Scientists up to Politician standards. Bill Nye is a genius, but his silly antics in educating my Generation seems to have lead some to not take him seriously. To which I reply, fuck that. Albert Einstein is in a photo making a tongue face.

If those stories are true (I'm on the fence as to whether I believe them) then in my head I'll just separate the work from the creator like I do with Max Landis. If they're assholes in person that doesn't affect the quality of their work, so I've got no problem supporting them. It's not like they're white supremacists or anything.

I think neuroscientists have already figured out that it doesn't "exist" by using experiments that show our body makes a decision before our conscious, thinking mind is aware of it. Our consciousness, the part we would call "I" is like a passenger in the sense that our brains take in and respond to stimuli even when we're not aware of it. 
I should bloody hope not hasn't he been dead since 1996?

Inertia is a property of matter.
As someone who has worked in transportation for many years (big rigs) I can tell you that truck drivers do much, much more than drive. The problem solving and critical thinking needed to deal with the issues that arise everyday will not be automated any time soon. We in the industry envision it becoming more like a commercial jetliner. The autopilot does most of the work but the pilot is still an absolute necessity. 
But the driving will be automated. He'll just be a tow truck attendant....
So everything
The one where you get your basic needs met in exchange for reasonable work. It's been dying for decades.

So much beer and food.. 
Nobody knew it would be so complicated.
I am Lucy Liu. GIVE ME YOUR SPINES!
I was with my girlfriend when we completed it.  Basically went from the morning when England's pub opened (had to skip and go back to Canada since their beer cart opens 30 minutes later) until the fireworks were about to go off at ~9pm.  Time gets a little fuzzy around then...
Everybody says so.
This sort of precision is exactly what computers excel at, though.
Vaccines make the top of the list. Being able to grow up healthy is the most basic thing. So many kids get infectious diseases and don't develop mentally and physically. I was in Berlin yesterday helping raise $7.5B for vaccines for kids in poor countries. We barely made it but we did which is so exciting to me!
Lol, this has already been written into a stupidly short article on ABC News, linked on the front page of Google News in Technology."Bill Gates Reveals What Makes Him Feel 'Pretty Stupid' "
I would probably be a researcher on AI. When I started Microsoft I was worried I would miss the chance to do basic work in that field.
I am pretty basic when it comes to clothes and food. My big splurge is having a plane to fly around in. I play tennis so I invest in shoes and racquets to help but they don't make a big difference.
It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer. It would be nice to live longer though I admit.
What did he give?
Polio eradication is a big focus for me. Our last case in Africa was 6 months ago and we are hoping no more show up. It takes over a year to be sure. We still have cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Until we get rid of it there it can spread back to other countries. Pakistan is starting to take this seriously including the army and the government. They need to do the same things that were done in Nigeria. The Taliban makes it very difficult. They have killed women going to vaccinate kids many times.
Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. I am still working on this problem.
He is still waiting for Google fiber.
There are a lot of great causes. It is important not to be frozen trying to pick since it is important to specialize and really learn the area you are trying to help. We picked health inequity as our global thing and educational inequity as our national thing and most of our projects fit into these areas. Part of the beauty of philanthropy is the diversity of causes and approaches that get tried. It is far more risk oriented than government or private sector spending which makes it special when it is done right.
We have some tough scientific challenges like an HIV cure.However the toughest thing is helping teachers learn from the best teachers. There are great teachers and the kids who get them are lucky. We should be able to spread those skills but the current system doesn't do it very well.
Right now there isn't enough R&D going into safe and cheap nuclear energy. I am supporting Terrapower which has a 4th generation design that looks good. It doesn't use Thorium - it uses the 97% of Uranium that normally can't be used for a reactor by breeding and burning. This means fuel will always be cheap. There are a lot of innovations but the key one is that it is far far safer than anything today - not relying on human operators.
So far we have not being able to use technology to connect people to the needs of the poorest in countries that are far away to tap into their empathy. I think this can be done but it needs some missing creativity.
The timeframe is longer than I would like. Probably 5 years before we have hundreds of them out in dozens of cities but we can scale up fast after that.

I'd be extremely surprised if he even had the ability to do so - that would be owned by Microsoft as a company, not by any individual.
Yeah, nice try
Reading things like that, I find it very disappointing that people here in the United States choose to not vaccinate their children.
Ah I think this was aimed at the one about what he'd do if Microsoft hadn't worked.
That's a pretty nice splurge

 Teacher here: Most of us never actually receive any training in HOW TO TEACH. And those of use who are good teachers are not rewarded, at least not at the college level.    Actual learning seems to matter less and less. There's a lot more emphasis on being nurturing than teaching skills students would use to get a job.      I've found that what's best for the students is rarely what's a priority for the department. Anyway. 
Any thoughts on pebble bed reactors? They seem very safe because they shut down automatically when it nears critical failure and they are air cooled as opposed to water cooled. 
Also, no matter what field you choose, automation can be a risk, but at least programmers have the advantage of being the ones needed to help develop and maintain their (and everyone's) replacements.
No, it will get scary when they document their own APIs. Then they will have surpassed humans.

Among many, many other super interesting things/accomplishments, Myhrvold wrote the Modernist cuisine, which sits on many chefs and foodies bookshelves.

Of course he does, it has watermark.

Chinese speaker here,Yea although it isn't the best chinese (frankly pretty bad), but its the effort that makes it so great to watch as Chinese is ridiculously hard to learn.Evidence: I have learnt Chinese for 10 years, still not native level. FYI I'm also a student. 
Those textbooks have been around forever! And since there are so few Latin textbooks, chances are high that students 15-20 years apart learned the exact same things. Kind of amazing, actually.

Considering that another human was never meant to find the chamber, not really. Imagine if an assassin went in and saw the elevator, but couldn't get into it. The assassin would then think, "Oh, that must go to the floor above, so let's just bomb the shit out of the tower to make this easy!"Little would they know, the chamber is tucked away nicely in some underground hole.

No way! The elders of the internet would never stand for it.
The new CEO of Cyberdyne just got promoted to CEO of Cyberdyne. The CEO of Cyberdyne is pissed he didn't get the job.
Seriously, once you realize you'll never be able to be an expert in everything (or anything at all), you also realize you should focus more on learning how to make experts do stuff for you. Those experts very often don't know what to do with their skills anyway.
I'm being serious here, watch Chinese dramas/shows. Start with subtitles. Eventually you can turn subtitles off and follow along. Once you get to that point, turn on Chinese subtitles. If you continue to take Chinese classes, this is actually a fairly effective way to reinforce what you are taught while at the same time being fun if you like watching shows. You also pick up on a lot of casual words, phrases, and expressions which you might not pick up through a regular language class.

no he knows i'm an actor. But he thinks it's kind of stupid. haha! I suppose he's right!!!
If I hadn't become an actor in the way I did. (being discovered by a director, plucked from obscurity, etc) I would have continued to pursue stand up comedy. probably would have tried to become an actor that way.
Andy Dwyer is the personification of my comedic schtick. I have been making people laugh with that clown for years and years. Way before I ever did Parks and Rec. He not all of me. But I AM all of him, if that makes any sense.
No regrets. Ever. They all led me to here. 
Not alone. But with his band of child ninjas, it would be close.
Wow. that's a good question. like a kiss marry kill thing?trick question. I'd marry and kiss them all. And I did!!!

I miss the cast and crew. I miss my friends. I miss the commute. I miss the fact it was a steady gig, all comedy, and took me 7 minutes to get to work. The hardest part of working on Passengers would be the schedule. There were only two of us primarily through the whole shoot and we worked incredibly long hours. I was homesick a lot of the time. It was a grind. 
That was such an amazing time in my life. There are elements I miss. Perhaps most of all, uncertainty. 
Jim PrestonPassengersOpens December 21st!!Thanks guys thats my time.
Keanu Reeves is awesome. John Wick is the shit. He's been killing it for so long. And hes a great humanitarian. 
yes we will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
love Pearl Jam! Growing up in Washington i have a very real connection to that music. I was at an impressionable time when it hit. So it will always have a place in my heart.
haha! Yes. It's amazing i made it out alive. The sequel shoots in a fewmonths. I already have nervous diahrea, diarreah, diarreeah, how the fuck do you spell that? anyways. Yeah. I"m probably gonna die on the sequel.
my wife would! haha!
More fun? Andy Dwyer. We got to do whole scenes, over and over. It was more stage play. Lots of improv. Guardians of the Galaxy is so fun to watch, don't get me wrong, but making it can be excruciatingly slow and painstaking. When you have so many elements working at once, you might spend all day shooting a piece of the movie that will last 10 seconds.

Funny guys can be sexy shirtless. But realness is more important. Exercising for health, overall physical and spiritual well being I highly recommend. Doing it to look good naked is cool, but hardly worth the sacrifice. Work on being funny before sexy. lots of women think funny is sexy anyway.
hello!Favorite thing about the PNW is the hard earned summers. Going to the river and floating down with some beers. I love when Mt. Rainier is out. I love the way everything and everyone slows down to feel the sun on their face when it first breaks in summer. Usually you've been through 100 days or more in a row of rain and mistiness. 
I had the best time working with Aubrey. My favorite moments with her were when she would let her guard down, (it didn't happen that often) and I got to see what a sweet and caring person she is. It's not dissimilar to the April character.
Jen is awesome. She's funny and cool. She's refreshingly tough. She's an amazing actor. It feels good to be around her. Best memory? So hard to say. I've been at this for 17 years. It's a dream job. No question. There have been so many unforgettable moments. I love what I do for a living. top 5? Also very difficult.Friday NIght lightsBreaking BadThe WireGame of Thrones Dual Survival
We were sitting in our chairs waiting for the next shot and a big set light bulb exploded nearby and she screamed. high pitched. very feminine.then she immediately looked over at me and said, "Jesus Chris! You scream like a woman! Did everyone just hear Chris?"and for the rest of the shoot i couldn't convince anyone it wasn't me. I just had to own it.: )

I've met a lot of the guys. it's hard to pick. they are an extraordinary group of gentlemen. And I suppose I am biased, being from the PNW. But that group of guys are all class. And it starts from the top down. So a lot of credit goes to Pete and Russell.

Yes, but it was self-diagnosed off the internet.

what weapons we talking? If i have a gun I'd fight the big duck. But if i didn't get weapons, and had to use my bare hands i would fight 100 horses and set myself up in a situation where i have the upper hand based on my terrain like the movie 300. whoa! movie 300 with duck sized horses! fuck yeah. 
He's already the lead in one Disney property, they would probably avoid casting him in another that is running concurrently. 
I came from New Jersey, so this may not be the best advice.

May make no difference - but I loved Everwood.  Made me like TV again - TV got bad for a while.  Everwood was amazing.  So... human, real.  You played the asshole no one liked, then got liked because you were a real person (the character was real anyway).Thanks for that.  
He answered the personal rather than the question about the movie he was marketing...  That's a refreshing twist from how these often go!  Thanks for your time, C-Note!
I feel like having been in 4-H with her, I saw that side a lot.  I think even with all the skits and hilarious antics, my favorite memory might just be Aubrey helping my 16-17 year old self walk down some rocks to get back to my kayak because I don't do well with climbing down things.  Didn't even make fun of me.

Make this movie.
This comment lost a little of its gusto after I looked up James Gunn.
Probably baby #2
They have a kid now and Pratt makes a shit ton from hisBlockbusters. Plus has a sitcom. She probably wants the stable life now
She's fucking hilarious in that movie
Actor lines. Helps with memory maybe?

No he worked in the pit.
Che! I totally forgot about that. God, he's impossible to dislike even when he's playing Seth's antagonist.
Terry Crews is an interesting take on this, as he's so huge and physically intimidating, but most of his humor is playing in contrast to that.I get the impression that a lot of really big guys develop a sense of humor to disarm people, because it's no fun to go around every day making people uncomfortable.
Uncertainty. He just said it.

Perhaps a respectably artful chair. Not too fancy, mind you. Wouldn't want anyone thinking he's some kind of environmentalist.
I think it's also in part because he already answered the professional question in a comment above.>The hardest part of working on Passengers would be the schedule.

That's what I figured. I did some acting in high school, and I could never memorize all my lines until we had already started blocking out scenes. I found it a lot easier to memorize once I had something physical to do.

That's part of it, I think.  He retains this beautiful humility even though he's an obviously hugely successful and brilliant fellow.  He also beat out his competitor entertainment / TV folks in Celebrity Jeopardy.  Actually demolished them.

I just saw it last weekend for the first time and I had no idea how funny it was. It does not get the comedic cred it deserves.
Just Friends is such an underrated movie. It's in my top 5 most quoted movies, for sure. Anna Faris is so delightfully insane.

I gained 60# when I cut out fun.  Apparently sitting home alone, eating Cheetos, drinking whiskey and crying tears of loneliness while watching Netflix is poor weight loss regimen.
Don't ruin this for me.
The whole cast was on Seth Meyers after the season finale. At the end of the show, the entire cast sang "Bye, Bye Lil Sebastian" together and Aubrey and Jim O'Heir randomly started making out. According to an interview with Jim (can't remember where I read it, it might have been when he did an AMA on reddit) during the final commercial break Aubrey just asked Jim if he wanted to make out with her during the song and of course he said yes, because who wouldn't. 
I know. I've never wanted to be Aubrey Plaza so much.

That's a preposition. 
Do you think Vin Diesel is one of those actors that refuses to break character? I just imagine him walking around set all day only saying I am groot.
Of course he is. I'm just saying that his comedic style is a significant part of why.
I am absolutely willing to believe Louis CK is smarter than 99.9% of the people on reddit. Comedy requires more intelligence than people recognize, especially his type. 
Yeah!  What's your problem, Reddit?
with April as the villain.
I love the end when they need one more vote to keep their sorority status and the one girl with the baby holds her up for a vote and the dean is like "uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...no."

i hear ya.  my first bout with depression i spent a week in a bottle. when i finally crawled out i swore off drinking, cigarettes, and joined a running club.  Every time i tried to drink or smoke i paid for it dearly the next run until i gave them up completely, and all i had left was running and the gym.  still wouldn't quite call it fun, but it was something to be proud of.
I like the Directors Commentary
This also sounds like something he'd say.

Yeah, I think aging helped even out some of that as well, for sure. Man, it's awful how superficial humans are. I look at that, and even though I know that he's probably a pretty cool guy IRL, part of me is just like, "Ugh, what a dbag."

I am @theRealBuzz on Twitter!They wanted a name that is better than Lunar Larry - and it became Buzz Lightyear because they wanted it to be more genuine. So now that I have changed my name from Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr. to Buzz Aldrin, I'm seriously thinking of adding a middle name - so it would become Buzz "Lightyear" Aldrin. 
An aviator! A pilot! After I was a quarterback for Notre Dame. 
Well, I prefer the soft singing voice of Karen Carpenter. I have heard Frank Sinatra sing "Fly me to the Moon" almost *too* many times. So I'm interested in composing a new song, entitled "Get your ass to Mars!"
I have inspired my own video games, 10, 20, 30 years ago, and now there is in Europe a video challenge, a video activity, entitled "Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager." And there game players can build their own space program from the beginning, and from where we are now on into the future, with some of the components that I believe will make great progress in our transportation systems between the Earth and the Moon and Mars in a long-standing reusable way into the future.  I'll have to check out Kerbal Space Program. 
Yes, it was challenging to understand what was necessary to successfully carry out all the training simulations that we, as crewmen, would  experience, and make a very successful use of that training and education. Training was much more extensive, and we dealt with many recoveries from emergencies, and fortunately, participating and observing and existing through the reality of space was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and it was not marred by unexpected hazards or catastrophes. 
The Soviets landed 5 things on the moon including 2 very long lived rovers during the time the Apollo missions were happening. If there was ANY chance that we were faking any part of our missions, wouldn't the very top priority of the soviet missions be to discredit, disprove and utterly embarrass their cold war competition?Not that there's any reason to have to defend facts from irrational conspiracy theorists...
That was not at all tempting. I wanted my white spacesuit to remain as clean as possible!

Phew! Looks like I'm not missing out by not going to space, then.
AWESOME. And now I owe a labbie $5. I bet him that you'd get flooded with questions and wouldn't answer mine. Thanks for taking your time to answer!
That's what's the most awe-inspiring to me about this whole concept: of all the six or seven billion people, only three at a time weren't on earth. Three. And it's the same with a possible mission to Mars: those people will be the *only* people (however few or many) who are *not* on earth. And as a human, being on earth is pretty much the *one* thing that is a given.
"Cpt. Phillip J Fry, Good luck on your mission, don't forget to bring a towel."
Dr. Aldrin, this is excellent advice.  I am a graduated aerospace engineer and licensed instrument private pilot working in aerospace industry.  You are absolutely correct that the piloting experience enhances and morphs the classroom instruction and book learning into a physical interactive experience!  /u/Daniimal take this advice seriously.Dr. Aldrin, a follow-on question:  Which aircraft would you still want to fly that you have not had the chance to fly yet?
My sister  called me "Buzzard" when I was a baby - she couldn't say "Brother" so I've been Buzz my whole life. 
I'm sorry you couldn't follow your dreams, Mr. Aldrin.
After a few weeks of playing KSP, I finally managed to land on the Mun. It was such a hard road to get there, that it felt like such an accomplishment. A couple days later, I was standing outside at work, and looked up at the moon. I suddenly remembered everything it took for me to land on the Mun, and it made the moon feel that much closer, that much more personal, that I teared up a little bit. Definitely get KSP. 
Hes very astute. The whole time waiting in line at the book signing he was kind of being a typical impatient, squirmy toddler.But then the second we got up to the table - he saw Buzz, immediately recognized him (we've watched a lot of space documentaries) and just kind of sat there in silent awe, then got really happy when Buzz handed him his book back.He didn't let the book go until he fell asleep in the car on the way home.
**Reddit...**Can we  *please* make this happen?
Hi, /u/BuzzAldrinHere. I'm Rowsdower, Community Manager of Kerbal Space Program. We're mighty proud of our game and mighty proud to say that you've been a major inspiration for all of us on the team. If you ever want to try our game, don't hesitate to reach out. We'll get you everything you need. It'd be an honor.
Scott Manley and Buzz Aldrin playing KSP would be amazing!
I've always believed this to be the greatest evidence of the moon landing, without using actual facts and evidence of the landing itself.
I kind of want to punch that guy in the face as well. 
Do you know how expensive it is to do laundry in space??
"Beginning to eat my breakfast... afternoon" We're not so different after all 
Was it out of this world?
Shit, /u/ahelm1988, you're dead.
What does you fink about the people who says the moon does not exist?
Freedom Cheese
If you're thinking of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he didn't hate the movie, in fact he loved it, he just likes to nitpick things as well like some people. 
We need someone with a very deep voice to read it aloud and post to YouTube. 
I also grew a beard , i was born a girl.
You're getting people excited about science the way Buzz got people excited about space exploration. You may not be cemented in history yet, but you're certainly making a difference :)
"Hey look, an alien"
I'll go in this guy's place. The only thing on my bucket list is to see Earth as Buzz did. That's all I really want.
You got Buzz Aldrin to answer a question. You touched history, man!
I don't believe it!  Beaming is always faster. ;-)
Actually, there was only ("only"!) 3 billion at that time. Only 2.5 when I was born in the early 60s. That's how much the human population has exploded in the last 50 years.
It's OK, he's using a throwaway... 
"So it was an eerie site, of a ship festooned with rusting metal, like gingerbread. Floating, floating out the window in the Ocean."My soul is crying.
Well that combined things I love
Moon: Aliens there told us to stay away.Try Mars instead.
"This is one small step... for Poopieheadsavant..."
There's more than 1 sentence?
Right - what is he talking about?  "Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon."  There is no habitat and laboratory on the Moon - though many of us think that should be the first step prior to trying to do it on Mars.  Or maybe Russia, China or the EU are planning it and we haven't heard about it?
poor guy must be devastated
If you want to see the space station you can actually get text alerts when it's gonna be above you. Nasa offers it for free. Just search for spot the station.
He's rambling a bit, but the answer is there:>I think that reading to children will help inspire that interest in aerospace, and many other supporting career fields. Not everyone can be an astronaut and go into space... However, stories, videos that come from the space station, and other people, are a great inspiration to young people for an exciting career field. 
"I own you!"

Or dear God.
Not very. Rules in video games can be realistic, but are always different from the real world in a lot of ways. I've seen astronauts play KSP, and they often overthink things or just aren't familiar with video game controls and the building mechanics. 
They don't expect to strap you to a rocket and have you come back safely unless you're wicked smart. 
> "Tranquility bass..."TIL there are fish on the moon....

"Fighting words" is real thing. Especially when you call one of the bravest men of that generation a "coward" in front of their family.
Man, if you made a movie where the mom was called 'Moon' and she was born in the year of the first American powered flight, and her son went to the Moon, people would say "Yeah, thanks for hamming that up, dude. Way to go being obnoxiously sappy".It was written in the stars!
Frank Borman, commander of Apollo 8, met Carl Sagan and didn't have a good story about him. Apparently Sagan invited Borman and his wife to his house in 1969 where he and his students orchestrated an attack on Borman regarding the Vietnam war per Borman's book.
How expensive? :P
Maybe you too could, one day, look back at Mother Earth and think "I follow the right man's example!"
Dude, you just talked to Buzz Aldrin... And asked him about burritos, awesome
"Oh, the chicken is burnt? Well WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK BUZZ ALDRIN TO MAKE IT FOR YOU, YOU BASTARD!"
When you arrived on the moon, was the people who lived there very friendly, or was they scared of you?
I could point out all the impossibilities and disregard of orbital mechanics in that movie, that didn't keep me from watching it 5 times.
Someone get Bryan Cranston ASAP.
So you grew *more* than a beard...
*Unidan, the next ~~Hitler~~ Buzz Aldrin*
If you can get to Russia, they give 2 seater MiG 25 flights out there for a frwction of what Virgin Galactic is supposed to charge per flight. I think they get up to about 85K feet, enough to see black sky and the curvature of the Earth.
Damn, I think it's really Shatner.<>_<>
The population of Earth tripled in my dad's lifetime
that was Europa, not our own moon
Imagine thousands of news anchors worldwide reading the name "Poopieheadsavant" off of cue cards and teleprompters, all trying to keep a straight face while addressing their viewers. Poopieheadsavant would be a legend. All hail Poopieheadsavant, space hero of the world.
This 780000 ping is brutal to my rank.
> "Just between the two of us, Bill, I've gotta admit... sometimes I feel like I didn't even need to bring the bow and arrow!"For some reason this feels like a Far Side cartoon to me.
Space Nazis.  Ive seen this terrible movie.
Looks like the cats out the bag... 
They left experiments and discarded hardware but nothing meant to be reused by a future mission. Apollo 12 did land near a Surveyor probe to study how it aged on the moon, but nothing more.
He deserves something for his troubles.
I love the ant dialog before Homer comes crashing into the ant farm.Protect the queen!  Which ones the queen?  I am.  No you're not, I am.Freedom! Horrible, horrible freedom!
Well anyway he tied a moon rock to his belt, which was the style at the time
WALKED RIGHT ON IT'S FACE
As someone who has a Frank Sinatra ish voice, I'll see what I can do.
I feel like we should page the Hoff as well. 
Hullo, Scott Manley here with Commander Buzz Aldrin...
Pretty sure he's got the orbital mechanics down... Since he helped develop some of the practices that NASA used
Oh*... at least i hope that was a typo.
*wicked smaht*
DROP THA TRANQULITY BASS
"You're a coward, and a liar, and a th^ee^f-"
According to Wikipedia, 66 combat missions in Korea, during which he shot down two enemy planes. Definitely not a man with a courage deficit.
Imagine what a whiney fuck he must have been as a teenager. I bet even his *parents* felt he had it coming. "honey, why does it take having to be punched in the face by the greatest living American hero for you to stop annoying everyone?"It's like one level below getting punched and called a dick by Superman. 
Buzz Aldrin, ambassador of awesome!
Not quite staunch, eh?More like general.
it's POW, you idiot. 
Let him lay among the stars
Not just that, apparently the guy had tricked Aldrin into flying all the way over to the hotel. He was expecting a role in a kids TV special and was met with a bunch of conspiracy nuts.
It's astronomical! 
Showing our visitor the very best of reddit in the top thread.
Nah, you had it right the first time.
I'll just go find a cash machine.
Gene Kranz's retelling of that story was absolutely horrifying.  Being absolutely blind in space would be unimaginably terrible.

Everyone forgets Michael Collins, The lost hero of APOLLO 11 :(

One day, we will be old men and women on www.reddit.mars, and asking questions on Poopieheadsavant's AMA.
You'd just have to play on the Martian server.
Me, too!  That was my first thought before I even saw your comment!
>Space Nazis.  Ive seen this ~~terrible~~ awesome movie.FTFY
Why he said "similar to what has been done" then? This is some very weird English right there.
Now we'll never know if ants can be trained to sort tiny screws in space!
He couldn't get any of the small dark ones, on account of the war.  All they had were the big light gray ones.  
"Yeah, yeah, I know you walked on the moon and all, but can you keep it short and snappy, pal?  Lol tl;dr, amirite?"
DUMB MOON! DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S DAY? IDIOT!
To infinity and beyond!
He might even be too advanced for the game, due to KSP not supporting N-body physics. Come to think of it, he'd probably be really good.
Scott Manley playing KSP with God would be pretty awesome too! Let's be honest, they're probably on a first name basis.
Hey, speaking of teeth-
Buzz Aldrin has been banned from /r/pyongyang
Buzz Aldrin, puncher of dicktraps!
Some punches transcend ethics.If ever anyone deserved a punch, he did.
BAM, right in the POW. 
Let him see what death is like
Wow, just when I thought I couldn't hate that cock stain more you go and tell me that. 
All this encouragement has got me thinking about practicing this and looking into how to get into that, haha...
Nope, just a white-dude computer programmer. But back when I was paying my dues working tech support people used to occasionally tell me that on the phone, and it  kind of lodged in the back of my brain. Maybe I'll try my hand at some side work, haha...
I love how everyone acts like tha AMAees (that's the technical term right?) can't read past level-1 comments.
This is one of those replies that everyone ignores as a harmless joke, but someone will remember when some big shit goes down and wonder why nobody did anything to stop him. 
From a quick Google search I found a price of $20,800 so if it was really what someone wanted most in life it's definitely affordable. 
Thanks for overpopulation, dad! 
And at the time, the loneliest human in existence. He was further away from the next human that anyone had ever been before. Plus, he lost radio communication for a good while, too, when he went behind the moon.
Possible? Yes. Likely? No.
I wonder witch toilet I will be sitting on then, hopefully it will be a nursing home on Mars with an amazing view. And I will probably ignore the view, because you know, Reddit.
What a weird phenomenon. As I was typing it I definitely was thinking I was getting a little Gary Larceny in my phrasing.
I think the movie you're talking about is called Iron Sky
Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Gimme five bees for a quarter," you'd say. 
I think that he would figure out that the game is using a patched conic approximation and know how to plan accordingly. It's safe to assume that Buzz is good at rocket science.
Scott'd be all like "relativity" and God would be like "snrk".
On Jupiter or Mars
Hey man, go easy on the cock stains.. They are no way as bad as this douche.. 
Thane of Whiterun status.
Another Reddit success story in the making, people! :D
If that was your life goal, I word definitely call that affordable. 20k + ~3~k to get to Russia, basically something like 25k for a one week vacation, the middle of which has you leaving earth. That's insanely cheap imo. 
I just can't imagine that kind of total isolation. Creepy.
It shows how remarkable the man was that after being assassinated in 1922, he was able to become an astronaut and fly to the Moon 47 years later.Not a bad achievement for a 78 year old dead man.
Its not all that bad. In a drunken conversation a friend and I concluded that Collins was most likely the first person to fap in space, being all alone in that command module with routine 45+ minute periods of radio silence as he was on the far side of the moon. 
My story begins in nineteen-dickety-nine. We had to say dickety because the soviets had stolen our word sixty. I chased that rascal all the way to the moon to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six missions. 
Is he good at rocket surgery though?
Buzz Aldrin vs Scott Manley
I could see /r/frugal having a heart attack lol.
God bless America.
SSW (Solar System Web). World Wide Web is just Earth. Mars Wide Web is just Mars.
Buzz Aldrin already knows he needs to add more struts. 
Please, O Lords of Kerbal, please make this happen!

I just put that in my edit as I was reading! Crazy thing to get exactly what you wished for.
Don't forget the boosters!
The Space Race 2: This Time, It's Kerbal
They should have realized they were going to be overbooked once the initial check-in closed and by the time everyone got to the gate they could have made an announcement. I feel like people would have been more likely to volunteer to be bumped at the gate rather than when they're already settled into their seats on the plane.
AMA Request Someone to Discuss Their Legal Case.Good luck with that.
Came here to say he should avoid the public eye and social media in particular until his case against them is over.
Wait, wtf? Lol. How did the bidding progress? 
When I was 12 years old, I took the plane with my 15 year old brother. On the runway, he got stung by a bee on the neck and immediately had an allergic reaction. They stopped the airplane and had an ambulance come and bring him to the hospital. I was left alone in the airplane after being bumped to first class. First and last time I sat in first class.
It really depends how it comes out. The people who physically man-handled him were law enforcement and not United employees. So if anything he can charge them, but we all know how law enforcement seems to take a slap on the hand for most incidents. I'd be interested to see how his lawyers word it specifically to go after both of them. 
Generally speaking it is not purely random.If he was traveling with family they wouldn't keep the family on the plane and drag him off.If he had top tier status, they wouldn't have dragged him off either.If he bought the cheapest ticket, had no status, had other flights to choose from - then it would put him more into the "person to be taken off the plane" category.
Inb4 the Daily Mail reports that he was arrested twice for money laundering and secretly owns an international prostitution ring.
if gets a blood clot on his brain in the next 48 hours or so and ends up having seizures or dying, United Airlines is gonna wish they hadn't, I fucking guarantee it
Exactly. Just up the offer until someone bites. Instead, they did this. Idiots.
Is it $800 plus they book you on a different flight free of charge? If not, not worth it. 
It's televised in Asia too. My family in Hong Kong called and asked my parents about it.
Incompetence.  Overbooking happens a lot but it should be dealt with before boarding.  They know if the flight is overbooked before boarding because passengers have to check in before boarding begins, therefore they should have been able to tell that the flight was overbooked before boarding ever began.
I'd like to announce that I'm officially boycotting United. Granted, I had no plans to book a flight in the near future and probably couldn't afford it to begin with, but by god I'm boycotting those sons of bitches.
You were probably entitled to 200% back in cash.
Probably very little or nothing -airline pilot 
Can confirm. Dude is definitely something.
I think it was one part the bystander effect and second, the fact that people thought that if they intervened, they would probably be thrown off for intervening, which is a more reasonable scenario that *shitty airline lottery winner*.
They are fucked. Every doctor I know is boycotting them immediately.
It's not really something that happens in Europe, this is the first time ive really heard about something like this actually happening and I've flew over Europe a lot. 
It looks like it was announced at the gate but no one wanted to give up their spot. I'm amazed they even boarded the plane without figuring out the situation beforehand.
Nah man it's just an easy karma grab. It's like people who patrol YouTube for the brand new h3h3 or primitive tech video to immediately post it and then gets on their soapbox in the comments to add some instagram-like caption to the post. 
No, AMAs are generally an ad. 
No. He should be all over Facebook, Twitter, etc. but in a way as directed by his attorneys. The more public it is the more United is going to suffer.
~~*As a lawyer*~~  As someone who has watched ALL of Suits..
Pilot came out from the cockpit, donned his cowboy hat, and started the bidding:Hominy-5-5-do-I-hear-5-5-and-I-have-5-hubbaduh-5-5-now-do-I-hear-550-fi-fi-550-thank-you-sir-fi-fi-can-I-hear-6-6-hominy-6-6-who-wants-it-6-6-and-a-Holiday-Inn-Expressand so on.
Excuse me sir, would you kindly place your arms behind your back so we may smash your face into your armrest unobstructed. Thank you very much and thank you for flying United 
> but we all know how law enforcement seems to take a slap on the hand for most incidents."After a thorough review we have decided that we didn't do anything wrong, however the officer being reviewed will be on paid temporary leave in Hawaii until he has recovered from the bad PR"
The next time he's running behind schedule his patients better remember that time he got his ass whooped trying to get back to them.
> If he bought the cheapest ticket, had no status, had other flights to choose from - then it would put him more into the "person to be taken off the plane" category.Don't most normal people who fly 10-12 times a year come under this category? Unless you are flying around the country and the world for business, you are definitely in this category.
and generally it is done before they're on the dang plane. whoever checked in last is by far a better way to do it, this was a huge fail even before he got dragged off. 
Citing this as their source.
Doctor makes 3 hard working young white Americans carry him off a plane after spilling tomato soup all over his face and shirt. 
To be honest I don't even know if he's conscious right now. He seemed to have gotten a concussion. 
South Carolina
But out of context it's so much worse!
You ALWAYS get another flight regardless of how much compensation given. The required compensation for an involuntary bump is 2x the ticket price up to $650, 4x up to $1350 if it takes over an hour for another plane. They always offer lower because then you'll settle for less.
$800 and a hotel.I'm going to start booking flights after I've asked if they're full. I want a sweet hotel stay and extra cash.
In other news united flights are still going out full 
Somebody was embarrassed in public and OP and I got karma. Reddit is strange. 
"Fire the dick that smashed my face in"
Agreed-airline pilot
Definitely Earthican
Exactly. I like to think I would say something but I would be terrified of being treated the same! No one truly knows what they would do until in that situation. 
Once the police are involved, stay the hell out of it.  Take videos, make complaints, but do it all after the fact.Same goes for your own interactions with police.  When the cop is about to beat your ass, you shouldn't start screaming that you know your rights.  Save that for after the beating ends or else the beating may not end as soon as you would like.
In my experience, when I'm on an overbooked flight, I don't get a seat assignment until somebody gives it up. If nobody gives up a seat, I don't get onto the plane. How are they asking people to give up their seats once seated?<edit> Ah, I've since learned that it was for airline employees who needed to be moved.
Believe me, it happens in Europe but you normally don't have it happen on board, just in the gate area. When it happened on my flights, it was always when I had to be somewhere so I didn't volunteer. Others always did though and were compensated.
It sounds like the initial message at the gate was for one seat; the demand for four came after boarding.
> Some gate agents in a heap of trouble.I think it's going to be more than some gate agents. I imagine heads will roll. Certainly that security guard had no reason to slam a man's face who was peacefully resisting. This doctor is going to get a multi-million dollar payout. Personally, I'd also demand the resignation of the guy who hit me, of his supervisor, the gate staff, and their supervisor. There must have been a dozen people who royally screwed up here. Then doubly, I'd demand compensation for everyone on the airplane who had to witness it, to cover their emotional distress. 
I'm guessing he kept his seat fully upright and did not try to establish armrest dominance over his neighbor.
The biggest contributing factor is selling more seats than the plane has. 
Overbooking has always been a scumbag airline practice. Imagine if a restaurant intentionally sold more than they had available and then just told people "too bad, no meal for awhile". It should frankly be illegal.
That's United's problem, not the passenger's. I don't really think it matters that he was a doctor, United still didn't handle this correctly. 
Best I can do is a voucher with a 1 year expiry and black outs.
Everyone reading this announcement has been charged an announcement fee.
That's sad. I hope you find it again. Good luck god bless 
Well played!
Not to mention the appointments he possibly had to cancel. Doctors' time is valuable as shit. As shit as in modifying the intensity of the value very upward. Not literal shit. And literal meaning actually literally, not figuratively literally as is colloquially common. 
You're allowed to sue more than one person for an incident. They're all going to be in the list of defendants.
Lol I will never forget the day reddit took a huge shit on Hillary Duff?
I think that title is still held by Elon musk. Not only able to become a supervillan, but probably the greatest one of all time if he switched to be evil...
Did you know you have rights? The Constitution says you do, and so do I!
I think he was asian.. 
I read that any and all evidence posted online will be taken to court. If the doctor himself speaks up before the hearing, it might mess up the case as words from victim will probably be taken to be true.
It should be going down, since the bidders are receiving
This I can see happening for sure 
Which is why I would be interested to see how they draw it up.
I can imagine him never letting it down."Samantha, you're 5 minutes late.""Doc, I'm really sorry, there was this traff-""You know Samantha, I was beaten off a plane and still made it on time"
Reddit detective and news anchor Ron Burgundy has reported that...
"Yeah... but like where are your parents from?"
That $800 tends to be an $800 voucher for another flight, not cash. As someone who's had to take that before, it's not actually worth it. 
I wanted to boycott, but the United flight was $7 cheaper.
"Get access to level 9 security and change the entire intergalactic federation currency value from 1 to 0"
Yeah, good point. No one knows what they would do until they are there. I would also like to think that I would have given up my seat. Depends on why you were flying too. Depends on so many things!
In other words, kill em in court.
Sorry little Suzie. You can see your Mom when you catch the next flight tomorrow. 
The guys a cop so he'll probably get paid leave while under investigation then he'll get fired (transferred to another police department); case closed.
Alternately, he could have reclined and armrest dominated all he wanted because no one would mess with him after seeing what happened to the last guy who tried that...
And there was a medical emergency on board...
What happened?
Actually, it is fine that the airline sells more seats than the plane has, as long as they are willing to buy back the seats at their established value when the rubber meets the road.The problem here was that the airline was unwilling to buy the seat back for what it was worth.  If the airline continues to increase the reward from $800, eventually someone will volunteer.
That's not really the fault of Delta though. 
I'm ok with the practice - better to oversell and make use of the no-show seats than to sell exact inventory and fly around empty chairs.  But if that is going to be the yield optimization strategy, they need to manage demand by buying back inventory to meet the surplus demand.  In the same way that we have to pay outrageous prices when demand is high, they should have to pay outrageous prices when they need a seat back.  They should keep sweetening the pot until someone voluntarily takes the offer.  Then you have no problem at all and everyone who wants to travel gets to travel.
It's a 4 and a half hour drive.  Put the employees in a car.  Would have been cheaper and faster.
Just hope you don't get selected by United's beat-down lotto and get the shit kicked out of you on your free flight.
Except it wasn't United employees that confronted the man, it was Chicago law enforcement.
"Hi you might recognize me as the guy beaten unconscious on a United Airlines Flight because I refused to give up my seat when I was already on the plane when they overbooked. I'm here to tell you That Delta Airlines will never, ever, ever, ever, EVER assault you for them overbooking their own flights. Have a nice flight with Delta!"
There was but we just beat him up....
haha I said the same thing - I find it comforting actually, because it makes me that much more certain this person is actually an attorney 
Who should? Money, please.
Haha, fuck you I can't read
Papa bless
We've all been well played.;_;
All of which can be derived from reddit colloquial context but an enjoyable read nonetheless 
Correct. There will probably be between 10 and 15 corporate and government defendants in that lawsuit. 
Send links
Didn't Google remove their "do no evil" from their code of conduct?
The important part here is money and not black. United is going to get fucked harder than a cheap whore. 
Yea the doctor was Asian, not white. That shouldn't really matter though. 
Yeah, I realized that after typing it but don't feel like fixing it.
but did he make it on time? I mean he was determine to stay on the plane to be on time, so it's more "I was beaten off a plane and still didn't make it on time. Things Happen."
Northern California
Depends on the airline and which city the flight is departing from. Delta gives out $800 Amex gift cards as a starting offer from JFK and LAX. 
If your taking a flight somewhere, chances are you really want to get to wherever the flight is going. I can't imagine anyone on the plane was just taking a flight for fun. 
Not if they kill you first.
And then he'll file for disability due to the trauma he suffered. And get it. Source: remember that guy that pepper sprayed the college students? That's how that story ended. 
If were sitting next to the guy who bumped off the doctor I would get a double clamato and accidently spill it on him right at belly button height so it ruins both shirt, pants, plus he gets to sit there with a damp crotch for the flight.I would be sure to note that the airline must have overfilled the drink, and apologize for the "overfilling situation".
do you want to get murdered? because thats how you get murdered.
Ironic, he could save others from death but not himself
Prettay prettay prettttay bad. 
Another article I read said people were saying stuff to them like "You should be ashamed to work for this company". Probably nothing too crazy but that's pretty awkward when you can't just walk away.
"I'm sorry United. This seat is now worth 10,000$ on the open market."
Uh ...which airport is that from? I might want to uh purchase a seat or two. And what would be the busiest flight of the day to start with?
They didn't do a good job incentivizing giving up seats. When agents are positive, offer more earlier, people tend to give up their seats.I wasn't there but I wonder after they offered the $800, of they explained they needed to get employees on the flight and that was just FAA regulations. Also why didn't they prevent the people from taking the flights.It's much easier to bar people from the gate than to forcefully take them off.
Yeah. United needs a lesson on how the Free Market works. Sounds like they had a plane load of people where all of those people thought their seats were worth at least $800. And they need to start dealing in REAL MONEY. Not this credit BS. What if I can't fly in the next year??It's exactly what the airlines do to us when we need a seat at the last minute. OH! you need to get to your destination with 6 hours notice? That'll be an extra $800, thanks! Except now they want to do it to us at literally the last second and also want to be stingy about it. 
Haha that was like, the worst example possible. "Ummm they do that in real life... and you can just go to another restaurant instead."
And potentially pass up the chance to fuck someone up?  No way!
airport security*
You joke about it, but that would be a fantastic use of Delta's marketing dollars. 
I think the airline employee didnt realize that someone will oppose this. Years and years of authoritative and herding handling of people by the airlines has made us very docile like sheep, he just didnt think he would have anything to worry about.
Nobody is perfect. Except that one guy, but we killed him. 
Just charged you a fee for reading your comment.
Fuck, I can't afford anymore Reddit today.
Yes he is an MD with patients 
Let's keep this about Rampart people.
Whoa, first I've heard of that... What a bummer
I think they were saying Elon is currently about Chaotic Good, maybe leaning towards Neutral Good. Man if he switched to Evil he'd be Lex Luthor. 
No the important thing is huge publicity and a major multinational company. This means any of you tier 1 law firms will take this case on contingency. 
It's okay, I laughed the same amount either way!
Someone watches too much porn.Or.. Not enough?
Note to self: schedule all flights through JFK and LAX from now on.
"Oh no!!!  It's so damp you may get rheumatism!!!  Please help!!! Anyone!! Is there a doctor on board!?!?!??!"
If Southwest Airlines doesn't make one of those "Wanna get away?" commercials out of that scenario then they are just stupid.  
Flight  $490  Injury  $  0  Insult  $  0  --------------  settlement- $1.95M  
My thoughts exactly, they probably had a strict limit on voluntary/involuntary compensation, heaven forbid they lose the cost of a seat or two. I bet they respond with "It's not consistent with our policy and the employee handling the incident has been terminated." When in reality, they were following SOP.
That's true! I may have oversimplified my point, I'm sorry. You're still liable to make more money if people are in the actual room. Room service, valet, incidentals, etc etc. It's more profitable to have someone in the room.
Yeah, but honestly, it *could* be - if everyone on that flight has urgent reasons to be where they are going, they may not want to give up their seat for quite a bit.Instead of beating people up who don't want to give up their seat, the airline should be forced to deal with their mistake and pony up whatever it takes to resolve the situation. It should be considered the risk for overbooking.
My Uncle used to do this at LaGuardia all the time, because he lived like 5 miles from the airport.He would buy tickets for a vacation trip during a peak time, when airlines were always forced to bump people - if he gets to go on time, great!  If not, $1000 and a voucher for a free hotel, he goes home and sleeps in his own bed, and is on the flight the next day to try again.
IMO it simply should be considered breach of contract. It's the airline's own misdoings that cause it. 
I respect that you're sticking to your guns on this one, partly because you're simply right, and no considerations thus far have refuted your point whatsoever. 
If they really wanted to up their game they'd treat is as an auction. Get people excited about the possibility. I imagine doing it in an energetic forthcoming way would built excitement, rather than resentment.
What a restaurant wont do is take you in, sit you down, take your order, and then send in security to beat you if you don't "volunteer" surrendering your table. That is essentially what this airline did (oh, also making the example bad-- you've already paid!).Also as you've mentioned the restaurant example is indeed bad because you can generally find alternative service quickly.
what's logic
I mean shit, a fucking limo with an open bar for 4 people would have been cheaper than 4 people times $800, plus hotel, plus seats on another flight.  
They said they needed them for to be in Louisville the next day for the Monday flight.  The 2 hour flight delay plus the length of the flight works out to be about the same.
If I worked for a rival airline's marketing department I would be trying to buy the rights to the video of the incident and getting the guy to be our new spokesperson while showing the video in the background of them dragging his body off the plane. The man is a doctor and that kind of money could expand his practice and let him help more people. At the very least it should pay off his med school debt.
If you're the one they call Dr. Feelgood, you might want to think about going Delta.
I'm sorry, sir, your seat was double allocated, your new seat is this 2x2 cardboard box that we're going to put in the overhead compartment.

Let's just keep this about how United is the best way to Fly the Friendly Skies, people.
No, it's just that it's Google's slogan but not their more recent parent company Alphabet's.
I know, but I wouldn't be a Redditor if I wasnt picking on someone for some minor point that has no real significance. 
He 's a doctor. He already has a lawyer. 
"there was until they beat the shit out of him"
I am aggressively passive-aggressive.
Then send those employees on another flight, on another airline. For 4 employees they were willing to pay $800 each to bump. For that $3200, they could have hired a private charter plane.
The problem is that the strategy of overbooking and then compensating people that get bumped have to go hand in hand. You can't just do the overbooking and then cheap out on the compensation. If you're unwilling to pay enough to get people to voluntarily give up the flight they bought, then maybe overbooking that much isn't actually a good decision.It's like mining companies that want to use cheaper, sloppier mining practices and then not pay for the cleanup. It's a package decision, you can't be allowed to just take money by screwing everyone else over. 
Well now it's also assault and battery. Yeah. United, good luck with that.
Maybe nothing YOU can do about it. Not me, no sir, I do something about it every chance I get. I leave adult magazines in the seat back pocket! Get fucked airlines!
And if they complain about not getting what they bought, you can send some government thugs to beat them senseless
No, all of the arguments against it are essentially: but it's difficult for the airline!
Reverse auction.  Start high and go down til there is just one taker.
He is 69, hopefully his med school debt was paid off years ago.
Amazingly, it started the day off about .75 but rebounded... what the fuck is the market thinking? that this is the start of something good for united?  "The beatings will continue until passenger morale improves" sounds like an awesome long term strategy
I better just go dig myself a hole to live in now...
but what happens if that flight is overbooked?
>I know, but I wouldn't be a Redditor if I wasnt picking on someone for some minor point that has no real significance. The Redditor motto, - u/i_says_things, 2017. 
I'm actively aggressive. 
I'm not defending the airline's actions. Just saying the employees taking the seats are not at fault. Absolutely I think the airline should've kept upping* the price. Obviously $800 wasn't where demand was at. 
You can literally optimize this and know exactly what your max payout can be versus the (potential) cost
No man that's covered under the section 2.3 "any passanger can be beaten til unconscious by up to 4 police officers at at the will of any united airline managment with out repercussion" 
They could've sent their employees on a competitor's flight last minute (assuming that was even an option with the blizzard) or dramatically upped the cash incentive for giving up your seat for less than the cost of this blow up. 
Knowing how they used to do things, he probably paid that off by the time he was 30.
Maybe the effects haven't really hit yet. Maybe once there's a big legal case, or a more widespread social media effect?
You have been charged a pre-account termination fee.
The doctor gets to launch him mid flight out the plane.
*Ahem* Lawful Evil. 
This seems like a quite coherent r/subredditsimulator post, even with context.
I mean yea, I guess. If that's what you want to believe. 
I seldom start a war like that, but when I do, I'm prepared to take it all the fucking way to the end.
That would fucking suck. I would refuse too.
But they don't account for the cost of the black swan events that make a publicity nightmare. Like that time there was video of them dragging a bloodied doctor off the plane.
I agree.  And in cash money, not credit to fly on the same airline that you are already super angry with
This is a perfect way to illustrate how stupid it is for people to point to the T&C as if they have any significant legal bearing 
I'm not sure why people are defending the airline so much instead of the consumers.
Doctors are still typically in residency or just getting out at that point so not 30.Graduate highschool at 18Graduate college at 22Graduate med school at 26Residency is 3-7 yearsSo in a perfect world with no delay you start earning actual money at around 30
No, I believe the stock is up because investors are happy that the planes are full and overbooked. "Dang, United is selling so many seats they have to beat people up to keep them off the planes, I better get in on this while they're hot" - United Investors Today

I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for. This worked out in a funny way when the final exam for a Combinatorics class (which I signed up for) was given at the same table as my Brain studies class (which I attended and did not sign up for). My friends from Brain studies thought it was very strange that I sat on the wrong side of the table and took the Combinatorics exam even when I was the most vocal student in the Brain class.
I haven't seen any concrete proposal on how you would do the regulation. I think it is worth discussing because I share the view of Musk and Hawking that when a few people control a platform with extreme intelligence it creates dangers in terms of power and eventually control.
It is worth learning how to read a bit faster. I am not sure what the best course for that is nowadays. I had a friend who took Evelyn Wood and told me what they said.I have a rule that I always finish a book once I start it. This might now work for everyone. I only read 2 books at a time - in fact usually just one unless one of them is so complex I need to mix things up. I read a lot at night and my biggest problem is that I stay up to late and regret it the next day when I haven't had as much sleep as I would like.
I am concerned about biological tools that could be used by a bioterrorist. However the same tools can be used for good things as well.Some people think Hoverboards were bad because they caught on fire. I never got to try one.
Microsoft and others are working on quantum computing. It isn't clear when it will work or become mainstream. There is a chance that within 6-10 years that cloud computing will offer super-computation by using quantum. It could help use solve some very important science problems including materials and catalyst design.
I think it shows Satya looking at how the market is changing and being willing to change how things have been done. His embrace of the cloud and mobile including doing software on other people's mobile platforms are also great examples of that.
The problem of how we prevent a small group of terrorists using nuclear or biological means to kill millions is something I worry about. If Government does their best work they have a good chance of detecting it and stopping it but I don't think it is getting enough attention and I know I can't solve it.I love both sushi and thai food. Since I like them better than my family does I have them for lunch a lot.
I love my work. I love meeting the scientists and field workers. I have the flexibility to work less if I wanted to and I do take vacations now. When I was in my 20's I didn't believe in vacation so I have mellowed. I feel super lucky that I can be involved in the Foundation work with Melinda for another 30 years assuming my health holds up.
I just recently switched to the Surface Book. I only detach the screen a few times a week and I like the keyboard better than my previous Surface.
Sometimes you just get very lucky based on the configuration. I forget the exact time but I think I had a time below 10 when it was just right.
I think robots that have vision and manipulation as good as humans is a huge milestone that will happen in the next decade and is being underestimated.I think medical advances will also be amazing and unbelievable. Like the robots some of the capabilities like gene editing will bring challenges with them.
I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate. The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated.
I like my current job at the Foundation better than I would being President. Also I wouldn't be good at doing what you need to do to get elected. I thought Michael Bloomberg was thoughtful about why it didn't make sense for him to try and run even though he is a great executive.
His silence means no.
I'll be interested in this answer as I sit on my porch in 72 degree weather in the northeast

Document your source code.
VR is the extreme case of AR when nothing from the real world gets mixed in. It can be tricky if you are walking around that you might run into things. Mixed systems which seems like VR but when you might hit something it shows you that seem better than pure VR. So I don't think these two things will stay as separate as they are now.
You are correct! I would put it at the top. Deciding to work on software was a good decision but that just crept up on me rather than being some choice.
No way he is answering this. 
At least we know he'll never have to buy reddit gold for himself!
How did this even work? You passed the classes you didn't attend?

I recently saw a company working on "robotic" surgery where the ability to work at small scales was stunning. The idea that this will make surgeries higher quality, faster and less expensive is pretty exciting. It will probably take a decade before this gets mainstream - to date it has mostly been used for prostate surgery.In the Foundation work there are a lot of tools we are working on we don't have yet. For example an implant to protect a woman from getting HIV because it releases a protective drug.

I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley working on optimal ways to employ mobile units for nuclear threat detection but it's hard to get funding in this area and I might have to move to a different project with more fundings soon. Have you thought about including grants for this type of project in your Foundation?

That's always confused me about that statement. If you're on the clock/salary you're getting paid regardless so of course you'd pick it up. If you're off the clock, you're not getting paid, so you might as well pick it up as well.
Thank you for writing this :-) I am currently a senior in high and I am involved with the stem program but I still have yet to see a lot of the graduates from it.

Programming does help you think logically. I was obsessed with programming from age 14 to 19 and that is a good time to keep trying to improve.
"Document your source code well." - FTFYIt's crazy how many times you see comments like the following:    // Hack: This is terrible but works and I'm not actually    // explaining anything or why the hack is necessary.    // I'm assigning x the value of y    x = y;    // etc, etc...Same with source control commit messages. Don't do things like:- "Fixed some things"- "More fixes"- "Updates to admin page"- "More bug fixes"- "Durp a durpity"
> VR is the extreme case of AR when nothing from the real world gets mixed in. I love the feeling when I read a statement and its truth is immediately obvious, yet I had never before considered it.  VR is a boundary condition of AR.

I studied super hard during reading period and almost always got A's. The big exception was organic chemistry where the promised video tapes of the lectures sometimes had no sound or no video - that spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course!

Hoverboards or Bioterroism?

#ALL. HAIL.
As a student in high school, I can confirm. If I feel that my class teaches me material either not interesting or not useful to my future, chances are I won't put my best effort into my work. I'll just want to get it done, forget about really truly learning it. I get good grades, but that high 90-100 stuff comes from things I like and think are more important.Except for French 3. Love that class, but I just can't get that grade above an 80. Aggh.

Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.

I finished Reddit when it was called Digg. I won't spoil it, but the ending is very disappointing.
On some dimensions yet, on others no.The quality outcomes are (so far) indistinguishable, and I have yet to talk to a cancer center or gen surg department where they concluded that it saved them money. Definitely not for cardiothoracic yet either.What it *does* do is let them compete for younger doctors who were trained on it straight out of residency and are more comfortable with it, and for patients who would otherwise go to the hospital on the other side of town because that one has the robot, and you don't.

This is completely normal, and it's really astonishing that in spite of so much research, this is the form of education we still utilize.
A billionaire expressed concern about a topic he/she is directly involved in... It would be foolish not to take a shot!
Lol @ people making excuses in response. No one says hard work = billionaire. But hard work = you achieving the highest level of success you can.If you don't care, that's fine. I define success as getting what you want. If you don't want anything buddha-style, more power to you. 
Careful, I'm sure Bill also has a better computer than a Surface Book at his disposal. I made an inclusive statement. ;)
I don't think it's any coincidence we call them dollar Bills.

Unlikely, as a 600 second score on expert is pretty bad, especially considering he managed a sub 10 second on beginner.Source: Played a lot of minesweeper. Fastest on beginner was ~10, intermediate ~45 seconds,  expert ~120.

There are still a lot of really low hanging fruits like mosquito nets and better access to clean water that cost relatively little, but drastically reduce exposure to malaria and cholera and similar diseases. That a life costs only $1000 also reminds us how unequal the living conditions on our planet really are.

This is what makes Reddit amazing. One of the richest philanthropists in the world mentions a problem he is concerned with, and within an hour someone that is working of that exact problem can directly ask him if he wants to help with a solution. In the past the student likely wouldn't have known, and if he did, had an approximately 0% chance of ever having the opportunity to even ask the question. Truly amazing.

That's why you need to play more to get more experience. Also, whenever you notice any pattern that crops up from time to time that you *don't* know the probabilities for - take a minute and work it out (even just ballparking it is better than nothing). There are plenty of patterns that are you won't see *every* game, but still pop up often enough that it's worthwhile to figure them out. It'll kill your time for that one game, but it'll help every future game.
Yes I agree with you. My scores are basically identical to yours. I am just saying, bill clearly didn't mean 10 seconds for expert.

Thanks for remembering my favorite remote of all time. Sometimes late at night I think about the young woman Nell and how we were supposed to be together but sadly we were born 150 years apart.

If you're future wife is anything like mine she'll insist on taking out the part of the vows where you promise to honor and obey your husband.  Try really hard to get that part back in.  
Taking Jordan to Italy is already in the works. We're waiting until it's legal to bring a cyborg into a foreign country.

It does fit. I do not wear it at the office at all; I wear it at home, and to the gym at Venice beach. 
Sandalwood and regret. 
Because the bread is connected, and forms a "hinge" if you will, it falls under the "taco" classification. Ergo, hotdogs and tacos are not sandwiches. The pita, however, takes us into strange territory and demands further study.
See my previous answer about the penis covered stegosaurus.
True story: I met Jack and Meg in a bowling alley in Detroit in 1999 while shooting a remote. They were part of a group of people that came over and hung out. Later, they became famous and told me they were part of the group that were chatting and drinking beers all night. I totally lucked out. Since then, I just hang out in bowling alleys looking for future rock stars.
I was in this scenario two years ago. I wounded one before nine of them took me down and ripped the flesh from my bones with their baby teeth.
My son really got me into 21 Pilots other than that my wife and I like to slow dance to John Grisham audio books.  
Riley, I yelled at you because you exceeded my 'one almond an hour' rule. That wastes water (an almond takes 1.1 gallons of water to produce).
The Asparagus, because I could change the odor of your urine against your will.

Thanks for calling that an incredible display. The goal I scored was so incredibly fake that I felt bad for the goalie who had to pretend to miss a ball moving at 2mph.

Go to Pino's Pizza in Cleveland Circle. There's only two tables but it's the only pizza my family and I eat.  I've been going there since elementary school. 
I don't think I've been very secretive about it. If I cold mate with The Fly, I would.
I'd like to keep this going as long as I can. It's really fun, and at this stage in my career it feels like something new and exciting. I've always loved my job, but the one downside is being in the studio every day. The chance to travel and try my comedy out on people who speak different languages is a great joy.
I got a complete 50/50 response on the beard. Half the people loved it, half the people hated it. Since it was my kids who hated it, it had to go. Don't fear, I still keep it in the attic with my wedding dress.
Yes, Bill Tull is exactly like that. 
That's a great question. What surprised me the most is how little I have to adjust. Especially in Mexico. The Mexican people are really funny and sharp, and they always got the joke instantly - and they weren't afraid to give me a hard time. I'm very comfortable being the underdog when I do remotes, and all the Mexican people I encountered were great and generous improvisors. 
Skittles, Hennessy and a new born kitten. 
Jeff Ross was molested by a puppet in 1958. When he testified in court he had to point to a human to show where the puppet touched him. 
Great idea. I'd love to do a travel show. In fact, I'm going to go shoot one in Mexico right now. It will air tonight at 10pm on TBS. Look for your name in the credits under "Idea By". 
Without intimate photos it's hard to say. I'll send you some. 
President Vicente Fox was very funny, and although he was talking about a serious issue, he came prepared almost like a comedian. He entirely caught the spirit of what we were trying to do, and he's a big part of the show.
My father Dr. Thomas F. O'Brien who works at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston has been working hard on this problem for decades.  He's the smartest guy I know.  He and his team have been working hard on this serious issue for a long time.  
in 40 years time we'll all be brains in jars connected to a giant server. But yes, my brain will travel the world.
I hope he does more episodes with just him and Aaron in the future. The celebs are often funny but I like the show more as a two man deal.
Wow. Your friendly, casual demeanor cracked through my cold emotionless exterior. The answer is no. Bud's not okay.
The Killer Angels, by Michael Shaara
Still no curtains. My dad says it happens for guys at different times.
I have a scar from an appendectomy on my lower right abdomen.  I have three cats named Thor, Maow and Cleo and the only one I like is Thor.  My ATM Pin is 1494.  
I'm from Boston, and a huge Patriots fan. We had to edit out all the times I tried to kiss him.
My favorite moment was when I threw the big pass that won the game. Or maybe that was Jimmy Hennessey. Seriously, I went back to Brookline High School about 15 years ago, and it was so much nicer then when I was there. They actually had a sushi bar (not kidding).  I felt like I had gone to high school during the Great Depression.
I went to the Trotsky museum; it's the house where Leon Trotsky was murdered with an ice pick. I think it's safe to say that I'm the only late night host to ever go there. 
Ah, the old classic question. I've always been a penis stegosaurus guy.
"Conan: Made in Mexico" (which airs tonight at 10pm on TBS). Aside from that, season two of One Tree Hill. When Peyton hit bottom, I thought my life was over. 
I think it's time to tell people that yes, we are dating. 
In 2015, The Masturbating Bear died of autoerotic asphyxiation alone in a Motel 6 in Flagstaff, AZ. He was buried with full military honors.
Don't make fun of Mike Sweeney - he served our country valiantly during the Korean war. We give Mike Sweeney the same hormones they inject into old Redwoods. Currently there's a branch growing out between his shoulder blades.
Olyphantastic
Liam Cartwright. He played tenor sax with the group, but left for better things in '58.
He left him at that cowboy shop
After something like 4500 hours of weird awkward television, I honestly cannot answer that.
Absolutely not. The Mexican people were warm, friendly and eager to participate in the show. We spent a week there. I met thousands of people and I never felt the slightest hint of trepidation or hostility.  
In all honesty, after begging hundreds of Mexicans for donations to the wall, I did not get one single peso.
I think there's a kind of bacteria they spray on oil spills that turn them into delicious frothy strawberry milkshakes. If that's true, that's my favorite type of bacteria. 
If you look at my show since 1993, I've always made fun of the president. Trump is the president now, and I'm always going to do jokes about him. That said, the overall thrust of our humor has never been overtly political, and I still think of our show as more silly than anything else. 
I'm not a big fan of marijuana. My drug of choice is wine, and the cheese popcorn they sell at Whole Foods (Smart Choice White Cheddar Popcorn).
I dare you to name a food that mac n cheese does not go with.

Have you seen the succubus? Much better than a unicorn
And you do this for how long? Please help I have  got to get back to work
This AMA is even better than I thought it would be. It's like an online remote segment.
If you'd be willing to formally lift sanctions on bed times we might get their attorneys on board too.
I just watched the clip of that segment where you met your wife, it was hilarious and amazing. I hope the guy whose furniture store they were making a commercial for was invited to the wedding. 
Probably because the only people in mexico that are as pale as you are menonitas, kinda-sorta amish cheese sellers
Ahh yeah we have Mennonites up here too. I think they're more well known in Mexico, but for any American who wants to understand the stereotype, they basically made Conan Amish.
That's okay we have several luchadors whose purpose is to be a comic relief.
Wait but you forgot to put a joke in that one.
The dare is neutralized when the daree has no shame.
I would love to see you in an episode of Norm's podcast if he ever decides to put any more up.
We all know your real name is Chip Whitley.
As a Mexican i NEVER miss any of your shows. Over at r/mexico we are excited to watch your special!
> Nopales. It's cactus with cheese on it. It instantly cured me of my 25 year impotence.Surprised you were allowed to eat it. It says "no-pales" right there.
I hope he never does
LUCIO BALLLLLLLLL!!!
You should find out if the league still exists and do a follow-up remote.
As a married man...good luck with that.
It might take Jordan awhile to feel this burn. Does he feel pain?
Did you learn that in microbiology school?
You should just walk around in it offering to spot people.
I left this exchange with more questions than answers.
Damn, not even an hour in, and Conan's already gone meta...
Has Jack built you the chair he promised yet?
Personally, I like to practice law while listening to slow dancing music

Cool now every time my pee smells funky I'll be thinkin of you
My wife made fun of me once for choosing Cocoa Krispies at the supermarket. An older gentleman in the aisle chimed in about how his kid stopped eating cereal like that since he was 10.But fuck that, I'm a grown ass man and I can eat what I want!
Did you see that ludicrous display last night, Conan? 
There's actually no period after the "S", because there's no name behind it.  True story. 
Thank you!  We both actually love trying different pizza places, so this is perfect.  So many new places opened up in the area.  I'll let her know tonight.
Conan O'Brien Can't Stop.. please never do! 
Beards should be kept in a temperature controlled basement. 
This is my favorite response.. It's nice to know you enjoy your work. You always seem up to the challenge of staying in character and going along with the bit.
What does a new born kitten smell like?
That poor human
This is gold. 
Jesus, this is top shelf stuff.
*Spoiler alert:* I think you didn't realize that "Comedian" mode is Vicente's permanent state of mind.
Reminds me of one of Norms openers where he was sitting around the table and his family of comedians were all upset he chose to be a doctor. 
Agreed, I did like Elijah Wood when he was on with him though.
He just thinks he's playing SecondLife
Nobody tell r/trees
fantastic Civil War novel; especially about the Gettysburg battle, if people are wondering.Incredibly readable.
Holy shit lmao. It's like you're a professional at this. 
Now I am Conan 
"No Brady see? The cameras are all off. It's just us in here. I know we've only just met but it feels like a lifetime of longing"
Fellow BHS grad.  I was so surprised at how much nicer it is as well.  All I remember from that school is that The Karate Kid IV destroyed my trust in movies because she runs around a first floor corner and suddenly appears on the second floor on the opposite side of the building.  Damn liars.
I heard Leno's planning to go there next week.
However, a close second would be a pterodactyl whose eyes are anuses. 
Mr. Conan, Don't ever change.
/u/Oldschoolhollywood is going to print this out and use it as their facebook profile picture. And it'll probably be on their fridge, forever.
At least he died doing what he loved. 
Pete Best and Stuart Sutcliffe are devastated. They're also dead, but they're devastated.
I'm so sorry.  If it makes you feel any better, this is one of the greatest moments of my life.
How about that unaired episode where you raced Teri Hatcher, slipped, hit your head on the ground, got a concussion, and didn't even remember throwing to commercial?
That's because you look Mexican.
Thank you, I was trying to translate it based on my two year old high school spanish knowledge and my translation made no sense. Good to hear that the actual sentence made no sense! 
Big if true
Did you smoke with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart when you went to a dispensary during the girl's driving test? 
Damn I miss the old crew.
And 1 from Aristotle saying sorry but he's more of a Leno guy.

Honestly might be the best I've seen. 
which remote was that, I'd like to watch.
I don't think there is a man alive who doesn't crush hard on Nell when he sees that skit.
Menonitas sell some damn good cheese though 
Any day now!
Andy Richter, the Swedish-German. 
Classic Chip.
Anyway, the year was nineteen-dickity-two! You had to say "dickity" because the Kaiser had stolen our word for "twenty"...
> especialFTFY
This is like a joke that Conan would say in his monologue to grumbled laughter from the crowd while he stares at the camera apologetically and Andy tells him it was a terrible joke. 
I hope that when you poop, a droplet of water kisses your butthole
I was actually surprised there wasn't one version where they reenact the scene themselves with him as every character
Because its hilarious
OH, OH, OH! TIME TO ACCELERATE!!!!
Not really. He was a coward.
Only in minute increments as per procedure. 
I think this is the best answer we've ever had to this question. "No, it's a Taco". Brilliant. 
Which is why I answered no when my high school friends asked if I was a virgin.
Dammit man! You can't just play by your own rules! A loose cannon like you can bring this whole firm down!

Almond researcher here. For maximum efficiency, we make the 1 almond and then launch the 1 gallon of water into space, rendering it forever unusable.
The problem with Conan is, he always tries to walk it in. 
The S stands for SAVAGE.  You don't need a friggin period after being called Savage.
It blew his mind how someone could get behind him
I'm going with Andrew Jackson. That man ran on the souls of native american babies and pure hate. 
You're going to be greeted by 1000 Reddit neckbeards when you get there.
Marshawn Lynch
He's truly one of the funniest guys on earth.
He should go into comedy.Start as a writer, maybe get his own TV show someday.
"I know the best microbiologist. The best. He's my father. Thomas F. O'Brien. You know, a lot of people say that they know what's good for us in this field. No. I do, because I know the best there is. You know, one day he gave a speech at a university about his work, and it was beautiful. Standing ovations for 10-15 minutes. For that long? Not common. But for my father, that man can do whatever he wants to with a correct mindset." 
We're devastated.  
nah, he'll never make it in comedy 
And what about the carpet? How does somebody forget the carpet?
Oh yeah? Prove it. What's your ATM pin?
Have ya heard of this Trotsky guy, have you seen this?
That's not going to be good for business
That's Dr. Conan to you. 
Till they realize that would mean telling everyone their Reddit name. 
Nobody likes beating a dead bear.
Liam Cartwright doesn't even exist as far as I can tell. Conan is such a troll (even though the Beatles weren't called the Beatles in 1958)
He could pass for Canelo Alvarez' older brother 
Think there was enough smoke in the car that he didn't need to.
You should try smoking the marijuana.
those really were the best days. The skits where they would show pictures of max and joel and conan hanging out, LOL
He was booked for Conan when Leno turned him down, but then Leno decided he wanted him on at the last minute, and Aristotle flip-flopped back to ole wonder-chin.
It's because we dare.
Yes, Conan of Braye End = Conan Obrien

why did i watch just watch the entire thing even though i already watched the entire thing like last month?
CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP! 
I heard he plies his seed in the neighbor's melon patch.
But what about subs where you don't cut all the way through? Like at Subway, Potbelly, etc? Are they sandwiches or tacos?
I'm honestly getting tired of Riley's shit.
But you just can't shy yourself away from them almonds can you? 
Fascinating efficiency, keep up the good work.
Naw, he had wheels, not tracks.
My GF plays Pokemon go, so she'll have fun talking about that with them.
Think you messed up the algebra. Given:> Marshawn Lynch = Skittles + Hennessy + new born kittenIt follows that:> new born kitten = Marshawn Lynch - Skittles - HennessySo the correct answer is Marshawn Lynch, negative Skittles, and negative Hennessy.
Don't know about you, but I reckon he'd be perfect for the Tonight Show
Good thing he has microbiology to fall back on.
You all know about the permanent revolution, right?
That's not going to be good for anybody.
Except that bear when he was alive.
Liam Cartwright was Duke Silver's first stage name. When he left the band, the Beatles almost never recovered. It took them a few years before they were able to reform as a lesser band.
Wow. Even after you guys confirmed it was a reference, I didn't know it was a (phonetic) pun till you spelled it out for me.
Just don't wear a beautiful shirt.
Ethan, you KNOW this one's real.
There are a few episodes after Conan left where on the DVD commentary they'll mention "yeah that was a Conan joke". If he wrote it/pitched it while he worked for them, they own it, doesn't have to be a whole script.
Because its hilarious^^^^also ^^^^same
#OH LET'S BREAK IT *DOWN*
His eyes stare like blank screens while his lips press together into a thin line that we believe denotes disapproval. "It's pronounced 'bis-CO-tti'," he says, accentuating the "t" sound, making sure everyone hears his crisp Italian pronunciation. 
Do you not?
Speak for yourself
That was smooth...as silver
No worries, I figured as much :) I think it was pretty clever as you'd have to know about the clueless gamer skit about witcher 3 to even get it.
"We didn't have any capital, and there was a giant, lit up 'FACT' sign on top the building, so we had to incorporate that into our advertising".That's some real world shit.  
That bald guy with the goatee was far more into Conan.
I do just making sure we're on the same page
OOOOF THE CRATER
Co-Stan-Za!
This whole contest was funny to Houstonians because Mattress Mack was far more well known here. He was a staple in our city.
Well if anyone's confused, she's the white one that's featured the most, at the ad agency. There are only a few women in the entire clip. 
LIKE THE PROPHETS ONCE SAID
Not that I've noticed. Airlines still make the additional money from uninformed, so it might be silly to get rid of hidden-city opportunities.
Yes. If the airline decides to reroute you due to a plethora of factors this can happen. However it is rare.
We proved it wasn't filed properly. The jurisdiction, Chicago, was not the right place for this lawsuit.
It turns out services that provide airfare data make it really difficult to facilitate what Skiplagged does, i.e. search by stopovers. I had to figure out an efficient and scalable solution to this huge obstacle, given that airfare is lots of data that changes every few minutes.The website and app don't make money right now, but there are lots of ways Skiplagged as a travel service can in the future (e.g. hotel commissions).
Hug of death
Never had a complaint. We tell you to book a round-trip as two one-ways if it involves missing a flight.
You reminded me of how difficult it was to educate consumers. It feels weird, but fortunately the trick is real here.
Pretend you live in California. You want to go to Denver Colorado. The ticket is $550. But there's also a flight to Nashville Tennessee that has a layover in Denver. This flight is only $300. So you book the flight to Nashville and just get off your plane when it stops in Denver and you stay in Denver.The only issue with this is it's a one way ticket and you cannot check your baggage. you either have to mail it to your destination beforehand or just have carry on baggage. 
No, airline's usually cancel.
Good question over here!!
Keep it as a war-chest in case they refile in the proper jurisdiction.  
Right now with the data collected from various forums like Flyertalk and other travel bloggers, 45-60 days out is generally accepted sweet spot time.
Same issue. It asks me if I'm connected to the Internet lol.
Or a straw poll that it edited into the original charity description area.
For flight search, we plan on adding other types of cheaper fares and offering misc features such as more real-time alerts on fare change. We're also trying to do more than flight search so people view Skiplagged as a fun way to discover the world. We expect mobile app to be the primary focus.
Yes, if they catch you doing this they can ban you from the airline.
Hey fellow RPI grad! Thanks for the nice comment. My favorite part was that the computer science curriculum prepared me well for the working world. Least favorite was the boring city. You?
Yes, as you search.
All the airlines have some sort of agreement. If you missed a flight, you missed a flight. They can't really prove you missed on purpose and therefore violated the contract.
Glad you found Skiplagged useful! Money is a scarce resource...definitely word of mouth.
I've never had a plane sit and wait because someone wasn't there. I'd imagine they'd only wait if like.. the pilot didn't show up. They don't sit and wait an extra amount of time because grandma thought her flight was on a different day, do they?
We're hiring so maybe! Email apply@skiplagged.com
Just wait it out. It got the reddit hug of death
The way we help users book is by just providing information. This way, there's no link back to skiplagged.
I noticed a hidden-city opportunity while searching for flights. Did research and realized these opportunities are quite prevalent--25% of common routes offer cheaper fares. Also noticed other things like how two one-ways can be cheaper than round-trips, combining one-ways to form a route can be cheaper than normal one-ways, and how two round-trips can be cheaper than one round-trip. Wanted to build something that presents a whole new class of fares to consumers.
Hi RPI person! I don't think I took that class.
Just a PSA to those who are planning to use this service and book a flight with it: Airlines are very privy to the Hidden City "trick" and will not hesitate to shut down your frequent flyer account (and take away your "miles") . You may be able to get away with it once or twice but if you are flying regularly and have a frequent flyer account with that airline, they will figure it out. 
Airlines also don't like it when you use the word 'hijacking'
As wonderful a sentiment as that is, that's very rarely how multi-billion dollar companies operate. I don't want to be a negative nancy here, but you shouldn't be surprised if you see the inside of a courtroom again soon.Or, even more likely, find yourself on the receiving end of their lobbying team. 
Yup, I'm sure you'll do the right thing -- I appreciate the response!  Big fan by the way -- I'm actually in business school now and your name comes up all the time as someone who just bootlegged a ridiculously useful product out of nowhere.  So many people here are trying to figure out how to disrupt the airline industry and you really nailed it.  Keep at it!
Rare indeed. Only 2.5% of trips get rerouted, usually in obvious times of issues like bad weather.
Whats stopping them from filing it again in the right jurisdiction after you donate the money and cant fight it?
American law is so weird. Here in germany that federal judge would have decided which jurisdiction was the correct one and the suit would continue in that court.
are you worried that airlines can strong-arm you out of commissions because they're friendly with hotels?
Well the hug of death lead me to downloading the app so you got that going for you.
I think the question is asking what the remedy for hidden city booking is if your flight is changed or cancelled, either intentionally by the airlines for violating their terms, or coincidentally (e.g. due to bad weather). Does your site have any remedy, or is this just a risk that passengers have to live with?
So if one purchases two one way tickets through the same airline and misses a segment on the first ticket, will the return ticket be cancelled?  Is this just for round-trip tickets?
I've always wanted to pretend live in California
Isn't the crux of this whole issue that somehow taking fewer of the same flights costs hundreds more? This really seems like a problem with the way airlines handle their booking and they're mad we found a way around some of it.
I tried this once. My grandmother was sick and we wanted to spend more time with her. The second leg of the trip started 30 minutes from her place but united wouldn't let me skip the first flight and said the second would get cancelled. This was the return portion of a cross-country round-trip ticket so it's not like I was really gaining anything... They made me purchase a new ticket, completely cancelling the old one. They said I could reschedule if I showed them a death certificate/doctor's note.
After reading all the other comments, it sounds extremely likely that they will take him to court at least one more time. Better to start at 30k for some lawyers than 0k. Wait til your turning a profit before worrying about charity. On the other hand, it sounds like he said that he would donate what's left from this case to charity in the original gofundme, so it may not be great PR to keep it. 
I think he might walk out on your before you get to the pizza, but all you really wanted was the beer anyway.
I think people sometimes lay their frustrations on airlines when in reality the issue is flying is a frustrating process. Southwest is one of my favorite companies because they continuously do everything they can to make customers happy.
Came here... searched for "RPI". :)  Also went to RPI for computer science.
But let's say they could prove it. What could they do to you? Cancel your return flight? Revoke your frequent flyer status? Ban you from flying with them?
What kind of people are you hiring? (programers, designers, something something)
Yeah, Skiplagged is more than just me now. We're hiring too...email apply@skiplagged.com
What if you don't have a frequent flier account? Is there anything else they can do about it?
Overheard in the TSA screening line: 'Oh yeah, I found out about this sweet deal from a hijacked comment on reddit, it was the booooomb!'
Good lord that is insane. Any chance to appeal / say sorry really nicely? :c
Ahh, I see you fly Spirit also.
Release code to github, host servers in china, under a different company name that is registered to an LLC that is based in Brazil that is owned by another LLC in bahamas and that LLC is a subsiary of the original LLC.
Maybe I'm just too conservative when it comes to risk taking but 2.5% is 2.49% more than I'm comfortable with.
They may have filed thinking they were going to scare the kid into giving in. When he came back with proper counsel and national media attention they may just consider cutting their losses. Bringing another lawsuit is likely going to bring even more attention to the site which isn't good for the airlines.
This should be the top response to this thread. I find it hard to believe OP has a lawyer who was able to win the jurisdictional issue but hasn't warned the OP that there is a VERY HIGH likelihood he gets sued again in the correct jurisdiction. 
> Do you also contend the suit is without merit?Of course he does. But no judge ruled on that.
I can't imagine this would be something that they have any sort of obligation to compensate you for. It seems like something that would be firmly in the 'use at your own risk' camp, like sports betting arbing and the like
Round trip only. your return one way ticket will be safe.
It's a lot cheaper than actually living in California Source: Currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
If fewer people want to go to Nashville (using this example) they can make the trip with one or two smaller planes and use less fuel than sending one big plane to Nashville, with the caveat that a stop in the middle is required. Lower operating costs = cheaper tickets.
United are cunts. 
Yeah but knowing the internet, if he didn't follow up on the original promise people would crucify him over it, it's stupid because he's probably gonna see more lawsuits but what're you gonna do
It is but they only recommend a few charities and don't give much information on the ones they don't recommend. If you're set on giving money to a charity they don't recommend you're better off with charity navigator but should remember that it's not the best use of your money.
Good to see someone doing the important research, thankyou.
Same with you, icq.
Skiplagged
BUT YOU COULD WALK THOSE MILES FOR FREE!
> Cancel your return flight? Yes, which is why your departure and arrival flights should be booked separately.> Revoke your frequent flyer status? Yes. Do not use your frequent flyer information when skiplagging.> Ban you from flying with them?I've never seen this happen, and I don't believe it would hold up if they attempted to do so.
It is likely going to fall on Xoo, since app designers will likely grab from "free" sites.Somewhere along the line, someone who gets paid to "produce" took your design and took credit for it.I am not a lawyer, but getting any money out of this looks slim, since you'll probably have to pay for a lawyers time. 
None of that changes how copyright works. You might judge it as a piece of shit, it was still something someone thought good enough to put on a logo, and that, no matter the objective or subjective quality of the work, is worth something for the time it was used, whether it was changed or not.
What are you hiring for? 
It is within their discretion to block you from booking further travel with their company
The brown people I know, East Indians, would risk it to save $20. 
The airline could pretty easily connect you to your FF# if they wanted to.  
Unless you work for a company that expects you to purchase your own flights, and then reimburses you. Then it would be silly to pass up the free miles
Probably supply and demand. I would assume that London to/from NYC is the busiest international route in the world when you consider the amount of business done in the two cities and the volumes of tourists going both ways.
For some reason, I pictured Aziz Ansari as the person saying this.
Of course, Hail Corporate! I mean, if an airline wanted people to believe that they'd ban people for using hidden-city, wouldn't the best way to accomplish that be by banning people? Why pay people to post about bans that never happened when you could just kill two birds with one stone and actually ban the people.
Consider for a minute what kind of proof would be adequate.  More than likely it was communicated over email and verified over phone.  Even if it was mailed on company letterhead, reddit could pick it apart.
What was their claim against you? Tortious interference?
I was referring specifically to just dropping an issue that's costing them money. I'd expect to see the lobbying route next.
But if your entire business model is based on taking advantage of it not happening, you'd probably call it rare too.
You are taking the risk. I'd say if you were worried about it, only book flights with final destinations that you wouldn't mind ending up at. 
Except that they're likely to win easily. The dude is very clearly in the wrong, legally; at least insofar as my rudimentary knowledge of the facts goes, this seems like about as clear a tortious interference with contract case as you can get. 
Or someone new will just recreate his app in a jurisdiction that wouldn't recognize American law. 
Seriously. This isn't really a win for OP. If anything, it's a setback, because the airline suing him is just going to start over with a totally different lawsuit in the correct jurisdiction.
> sports betting arbing ?
Former Continental / United IT here. Your return one way ticket could absolutely be cancelled if we wanted to, but nobody really cares that much.
Not completely. Base costs (like jet fuel price) still determines a lot of their flight scheduling and pricing. However, they do want to be able to say they go to the most cities to drive up customer loyalty.
You pretend to live in California like every day?
True. I'm positive that if that were to happen, though, he'd probably raise another 80k through the internet.
Not even. Hotels, airlines and rental car companies already have working relationships. Hidden city on other hand if not illegal is at least  CLEAR violation of the terms and conditions of the tickets purchased, so I don't see anybody partnering with him.

Except Elon Musk, he gets a free pass even though many of his business practices are worse the a lot of others ( Engineers  working 70-100 hr weeks for not amazing pay) 
Airlines like Spirit and RyanAir *can* be cheaper if you play the game, but they're often so nickel and dimed on things that people take for granted that you can easily find yourself paying more than intended if you don't know what you're doing.
I'm a bit confused by this--why would your service change with you learning the lower cost of airfare? Regardless of your salary or ticket prices, your reason for and commitments to holding your job don't change, so which rationale would or do you use to autonomously adjust your practices, outside of subjective principle? I might have misinterpreted your comment though; in that case, my apologies.
Hold up?  Why should a private corporation be told who they should and should not do business with?  It's not like people who skiplag are a protected class...
It's pretty funny that this website is basically called 'sue me'
Looking for employees who are okay being unpaid
Investors? Ownership?
Claim a medical emergency happened so you couldn't make the connecting flight.  HIPAA prevents any doctor from sharing medical information.  They'll ask you for your doctor's name and information and then never request proof because they can't. This also works for simply cancelling a flight.
"I'm a little fat girl!!"
I'm brown and this is hilarious. I'll accept any racism thrown my way if it makes me laugh
Apparently, UAL doesn't want to in my case.  I have to call them every goddamned time to get them to credit me the miles whenever I have to use them.
You don't have to purchase the flight to get the miles. You're thinking of credit card reward points. You get miles from having your butt in the seat. I've flown over 200k this year and am not allowed to book the flights on my own CC, unfortunately. However my mileage bank is close to 1 million ff miles with United at present. 
If you travel you are just taking the miles from the person paying for it. If you are paying for the tickets it's worth it to shop for the lowest.Frequent flyer miles are really marginal and aren't worth a whole lot. For example I frequently make abut a 1,000 mile trip. The tickets are about $400. I would have to make 25 of these trips to get enough frequent flyer miles to get a free ticket for this flight. That's $10,000 to save $400. It' basically a discount of 4%
Surely then it would cost more to fly NYC? Like the reason this Skiplagging works is because less popular routes are cheaper. So why would the more popular route in this instance be cheaper?I regularly travel between LHR and RIC. You have to connect somewhere to make this journey and I purposefully avoid JFK and ATL because they're such a clusterfuck - but it's often cheaper than CLT or IAD, which are my preferred routes...
I did too, but I didn't really realize it until I read your comment. 
Maybe not, if they still want the money from the existing hidden city bookings, while at the same time discouraging new hidden city bookings. 
He screwed a turtle?
But they would reach a SURPRISE destination, which is even better!
Don't risk hidden cities that are experiencing really bad weather for airplanes. That's it.
"I'm sorry, I can't legally enter the state of Ohio anymore, can I get a refund?"
People not from around here generally think that all of southeast Michigan is a barren, post-apocalyptic wasteland. In reality most of it is actually quite nice...

But it also draws more attention to his service. 
Arbitrage... risk hedging in sports gambling.  Say I bet 10,000 on Team A to win the title early in the season at 10-1.  As it turns out just before the championship game I can get 2-1 to bet on Team B that will be playing against Team A in the championship game.  If I bet 10,000 on Team B at 2-1,  I either get $80,000 if Team A wins (my winnings minus my $20,000 total outlay) or I break even if Team B wins.  I've hedged my risk.
And they never will because if you cancel the wrong persons ticket (say someone going for medical treatment or going to a funeral) the airline would have more bad press than any amount of missing flights could cost.
Mckinleyville?  Wild guess out of Arcata. 
Then offer a reasonable price to take the horse early so you can ride it to the bank.  Never come back.  Something along those lines.Schultz decided to shoot the farmer before any of this could happen, so it didn't really play out how he intended.
Not with that attitude. 
Look at prices before federal deregulation. It was like $1200 for a cross country flight because airlines had to get federal approval to change routes or fares. 
It would still be protected from someone else using it for monetary gain. There are plenty of tutorial book on how to draw Mickey Mouse for example. 
So interns
they can still refuse you anyway though, they can refuse you because they think you're ugly if they really wanted to(disclaimer: I think you're beautiful, in every single way)
It's Mulaney man! Jesus!
They totally can. If you miss a flight in any stage of a round trip they cancel all remaining segments and you get no refund
Cuz they make money regardless...so, they are exactly like EA.Pre-orders, DLC, pre-buying season passes.  People aren't very smart with their money.
Yea they have enough data for a computer to do a cross check algorithm to figure out all the skippers out there.The problem they have is that they don't want to start another viral campaign if they start shutting down FF accounts. Maybe they'll just flag it so they can give you shit later... 
No joke, my mom will drive 10 miles to save 10 cents on anything. I keep trying to tell her that those 10 miles wasted more in gas then she will save. No dice. It's a dime in her pocket.
East Indian as in India. I generally hear the term 'East Indian' to differentiate us from native americans, who are also called 'Indian'. South Asia also includes Pakistan/Bangladesh/Nepal etc.
Well, there's two ways of looking at that. Using your credit card means you get the credit card rewards, but it also means you're giving your company an interest-free loan. Or, combine the two in your head -- you're giving your company a loan with an interest rate matching your cashback rate on the card.Depending on the company, it can also be easier to file the expense report later if you used their credit card.
Sure,  but if your company sends you business class to Tokyo, you'd just about hit your mark on a single flight. You also get far more perks than just free flights. You get free lounges, upgrades, booze, gifts, massages, discounts, etc. 
If you reduce the ~~flight~~ price for the popular route, you're more likely to get a full plane. This gives you a higher profit margin per flight (remember, a flight is going to have similar costs whether it's full or empty; maintenance and crew wages are the same).If they charged the same price for a route only a small fraction of passengers book, it wouldn't be worth it due to opportunity costs. Every LHR - CLT flight is a plane, pilot, flight attendants and ground crew that isn't being dedicated to the profitable busy route 
Tort is a wrongful act or an infringement of a right (other than under contract) leading to civil legal liability.
So...tortious interference, then?
As crazy as that is, it can literally happen.  I wonder what the legal issues would end up as!  
ann arbor is awesome. is that southeast?
It's official as fuck. Wild card here we come.
I think the point is that the airlines have zero obligation to you, if they feel like canceling your ticket they can
Lol that's actually a good idea. 
reasons to carry on:- you don't have to pay fees that many carriers have for checked baggage- no waiting in line to get bag checked and no waiting to get bag from baggage claim gets you in and out of airport faster- don't have to worry about bag getting lost which does happen infrequentlyso if you bring a carry on that is designed to fit in overheads you can save time and money. pretty easy to understand.
Isn't that a different situation? Mickey Mouse is copyrighted as a character, while there is no general copyright on a "cartoonish plane" character. I assume the automatic copyright would be on the specific image, and that wasn't used by OP.
"Because we're Delta Airlines and life is a fucking nightmare."
Yes. They aren't even allowed to tell someone you're a patient with first getting your consent. 
Asking your dad for proof is one thing. Asking the doctor for proof is another.
mr baloney
oh, yeah   but didn't I read somewhere that you actually book two one-way flights?
Can confirm. The cross check algorithms. 
I take it your dad pays for the fuel?
Ahh I thought it was Indians from the east part of India!I am not a smart man.
It also just straight up costs more per passenger to fly a smaller plane.
Ohh so he wrongfully acted or infringed on the rights of a turtle which lead to civil legal liability. Makes sense now
I am not American, but I think it is just like international Airports, airports don't count as that place "soil" so as long as you don't leave the airport you don't legally "enter" the state
Just imagine if you hadn't got screwed against the Seahawks
Uh, well there wasn't an actual farmer. He only used it as an example when planning on buying Django's wife. Dammit just watch the movie!
Mickey Mouse is trademarked. Copyright is automatic so you don't need to "copyright" something, but as you said, maybe not for something you create from a tutorial. 
"Can I please go home, on an airplane""No, in fact, we're gonna frame you for murder!"
Beauty is subjective, you're the most beautiful person in the world to *someone*.
And if they're smart their computer systems are setup to detect people getting two one-way flights in order to use skiplagged recommendations.
That and on less popular routes you're less likely to fill up said plane, meaning you need to charge more per passenger.
You guys are my new "watching Suits" buddies. 
"You're a little fat girl, aren't you?""Noooooo""Say it!""I'm a little fat girl"

Getting straight to it I see.
That question might be too hard for any human being. Greatest invention... I just described one, which was a device to pop anywhere - real tiny, into a glove compartment, a backpack, whatever - and be able to locate it, wherever it is in the world. There are some devices that kind of claim that now, but they don't really work sufficiently. A device that gives us one extra hour per day?
u/andymbrit, I get asked that everywhere. I have pulled so many hundreds of pranks; I pull pranks almost every day! So I can't come up with one funniest prank. Sometimes I like to talk about early ones; when I was so young, how could I have thought of it.I did like the one where I put a little ticking electronic metronome in a school locker, back when very few people could build such things as a ticking metronome; and I had it rigged so that when you opened the locker, a little tinfoil switch caused the ticking to speed up.
He said on Conan that he never had a big confrontation with Jobs like portrayed in the Fassbender movie. They took a lot of complaints from various employees and made the Woz character the mouthpiece  for all that.
I'd like to know if he plays with Linux at all.  I couldn't imagine him not.
I would like to know this as well.
He wasted no time responding to it either haha.
> A device that gives us one extra hour per day?google is working on that, it's called the driverless car
I loved my Zune HD. I still have it somewhere around the house.
that'll get you sent to jail nowadays
I thinks that's a completely valid creative liberty there. It tells an affecting story better that way.
Why would he sign an NDA regarding his opinion on portrayals of his own likeness? It's not like he was in the films. That doesn't make much sense.
Slotnick master race!
Of course he does, I remember in an interview once Woz mentioned that he forces himself to use platforms that he never would normally. So for example for a couple of months he would use an Android phone and and not touch his iPhones. That way he can give fair arguments about the different platforms to people without being an ignorant fanboy of one side.
yeah it would be great to hear his thoughts on the free software movement.
Welcome to reddit
Just watched this the other day. Why didn't Jobs acknowledge the Apple II team? Why??So that's my question to Woz. Was there any truth behind that whole thing?
I think a lot of people look at iPhone OS 1.0 with rose colored glasses.  It had:* No App Store* No multitasking* No folders* No copy and paste (!)And, while snappy, native apps like Safari *loved* to crash all the time.
> since the Apple IIeThis guy probably played the original Castle Wolfenstein like me. :P
They are already doing it. The chip in the lastests phone is physically blocking brute force attacks. they manifactured the phone in a way that it's not code that is stoping you from hacking the phone but physically the chipset will just not let you. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
I think you're missing the nuances of what he said. He said "Twice in my life I wrote things that could have been viruses". So he was probably writing code for something else, and it could have been used as a virus. It's sounds to me that he didn't write it as a virus. 
Yeah I was pretty sure giving that answer was the reason for the AMA.
That'd give me 2 hours a day! I think my happiness would improve by immeasurable amounts. 
Bulma's never around when you need her..
That would give you two extra hours.
Oh good, I'm not the only one. The hardware on that thing was great.
This isn't to disparage Woz, but I think I would be a better person if I didn't have to worry about money.I think everyday stresses are what effect my moods the most. Having to work for the man and cementing my future is the biggest part of it. 
It would be worth it and you could use the now famous "woz defence"
This reminds me of a prank pulled on me using an annoy-a-tron from thinkgeek.com.  I'm on mobile or I would link it.  Let's just say it is very, very effective.  I destroyed my office looking for the beep.  By destroyed I mean smashed a lamp and over turned a couch.  But trust me, If there were more things to destroy I would have totally destroyed them too.
Why didn't he just fucking chuck it when he got outside?
No, that'll be when you don't see anyone walking down the street at all because everyone's at home plugged into VR
No better answer from a 13 year old.
I used to have that argument with an ex a lot.  My phone would ding and he'd ask me how I could not immediately look at it and I'd say "because we're in the middle of dinner and I'm having a conversation with *you* right now and the message will still be there later."And then his phone would ding and he'd pull it out and start typing.
I'm in that strange state of mind where the first thing I wondered after reading this is wether someone can be illegally blind.
And 150 years ago it used to be a newspaper, times haven't changed that much. 
You should post a video of this. Smart birds are so bizarre and interesting
I really agree! No short one sentence answers. And he has answered quite a lot of questions too, compared to others. One of the best AMAs!
Unless the story is about the Woz. =/
Good old Xerox PARC, the R&D lab that invented all these incredible things that Xerox themselves had no clue what to do with.
I still shiver at this.That movie was so amazing and it deserved so much more than just an obscure cable channel release.
Oh man, I loved the Newton! I got one from a family friend, and it was the best thing ever as a kid, I still wish you could scribble on a touchscreen and have it "explode" erase the text... that thing was so ahead of it's time.

Exposing yourself to as many environments as you can is very important if you want to be a great developer.
If you mean to say that Batman has no realistic chance against Superman, then that's just silly because Superman by his abilities is unrealistic.But Batman is a tactician and super rich, and Superman is just a cannonball. All Batman has to do is load up crop dusters with synthesized kryptonite aerosol and pollute the sky.
One of the oldest toys ever discovered was a 4000 year old doll.  It's amazing how far the artificial partner concept has managed to evolve.  I can imagine a world where human/machine partnerships make interpersonal relationships between two humans completely unnecessary.
Anyone who has not watched, ABSOLUTELY MUST. And go do that because SPOILERS AHEAD. So, what we learn is that when our best friends, even lovers are machines, they're going to get bored of our retarded (by comparison) selves eventually and go be with their other machine friends.
Yes! This Steve acknowledges that adverbs are important. 
1. Money2. Status3. Be real good4. Know the right peopleUniversities are willing to pull some strings if you really need them too. They also do this to protect celebrities and such.

Generally when you defer from a degree or university program, you only have x number of years to go back and complete it with having to start all over again...
Karmalogically I should be welcoming you amigo
Eventually (after the ending of the movie), Jobs did start thanking the employees in real life. I don't think it was until the release of the iPhone that he started doing that. After he did, he started doing it at every presentation.My guess is that, after he got cancer, he changed. He was still an asshole, but maybe a little less so after he realized how short life is.
I remember showing off my OG Droid to friends with iPhones (which launched with many of these features)."Look, the interface may be arcane, but WATCH WHAT I CAN DO." Both platforms have come so far since then, and I really think they've pushed each other in a really great way. I'm not sure Android would have gotten user experience unfucked as quickly as they did, and I think single-tasking would have festered on the iPhone a lot longer without the competitive pressure. I may personally prefer Android, but the competitive pressure has been undeniably good for the consumer.
Honestly, the original iPhone was probably no more polished software-wise than the Watch. But when the original iPhone was released there were no mature, feature-rich mobile platforms to compare it against like iOS.
When I was a kid, the IIe was the only computer I'd ever seen. Monochrome green. 
I have a thumbdrive that does that, called an Ironkey. It's pretty neat. Only 2 gigs though. If you want secure though, I guess it's a good call. I think you get five tries on the password before it nukes itself at the hardware level.
That is still confusing the shit out of me.
Buddy, you ought to consider getting an apartment closer to work.  Provided you can afford it, of course.  Losing two hours a day to commute is just not worth it.  
DC traffic, nothing like it 
No way in hell! Sleep on the way in and pull out the beer/jakcs from the built-in cooler and sit back for some hammer time for the ride home. Watch some pron or cat vidoes on the way back.
Thanks Obulma!
Capsules came way before trunks
Still have mine too. Everything about it was great
Even before they had money, when Steve Jobs secretly took a bigger share of the money they had made from the first PC they had made, when Woz found out he was just like "I wish he had just told me, I would've given him the money anyway"He's always been a great guy, dude. 
"IT WOZ JUST A PRANK, BRO"
clocks fired
He also got repeatedly pulled over for speeding, because he knew it would make the news. He wanted people to understand that you CAN go fast in an electric car.

It's funny. We think our society is so advanced and cultured, but we're all just a few beeps away from becoming baby murdering apes. 
Isn't the point of a text or email that it can wait a bit? Sometimes you have to email specific info but usually if it's urgent you call. Otherwise, wait. Anything else is rude.
"We've got a warrant for your arrest!""I'm sorry but I can't read that-""He confessed! Book him, boys!"
You'll be missed, bud. Rest in pickle juice.
Not entirely accurate.People didn't walk around talking in to newspapers while they walked down the street (or even reading them for the most part)I'm sure a large portion of the site knows what it was like walking down the street growing up in a time before cell phones and can tell you it *is* different now than then.Sure sitting around on a bus people may have had their nose in a magazine instead of a phone, but walking around? No.Not saying for good or ill; but times *have* changed in that regard.
But, I mean, it's literally called Steve Jobs. I think we all know who it was about. 
At the time he was "the young guy from ER".
exactly, Xerox fucked themselves pretty well.
It really was. That device was magic. My father had one and it remains to this day the best experience I've ever had with a stylus.
It's not the newton that made the calls free. It's the numbers you dialed in. It was easier to automate dialing of  long sequences with pauses etc... with its touch-tone dialer application. Small enough you could use it with payphones in public places without looking too much like a weirdo.
> Exposing yourself to as many environments as you can is very important if you want to be a great ~~developer.~~ *person*
Wozniak left Apple before OS X..  before Linux.. before the Internet.
Superman don't need no sky, he can just go into space and fry badman from orbit with his laser eyes.
Holy shit that's profound.
> 143kwoah
>My guess is that, after he got cancer, he changed.We call this the Archer effect.
It really is amazing to see how both have developed having used both for a very long time now.  You're absolutely correct, that the ios mantra was always "only do what we do well, we can always add features" while android was always "I want it to do whatever I tell it to do, we'll patch the bugs and make it look nice later".  It's amazing to watch the gap now closing in.
Was the camera quality that good? The experience, for sure, with the big screen, but I think my Sony Ericsson still took better pictures.. 
How about No Video Recording, No Camera Flash, No Front Facing Camera, a screen resolution of 320 x 480 (on  3.5" screen which we all thought was huge!)
The original iPhone didn't even allow for third party apps at launch. The hardware was great at the time but the software took some time to mature. 
> before it nukes itself at the hardware level.This may pose a problem.
A virus - really, just about any malware - works by hijacking legitimate software on some level. Just to give the other answer some context.Software that's written for a legitimate purpose can sometimes be retooled to do nasty, nasty things. A tool that scans your network for known vulnerabilities is an important part of any sysadmin's or security consultant's toolbox. But what if a malicious person integrated it into a script that would then *use* the found vulnerabilities? Now it's a tool that automatically undermines your network security by brute force. Nasty.
Windows shot first!
set yourself up a test environment and hack away.It's your stuff, you do what you want with it.
That's the catch. I'm paying $200 a month with an hour commute or I can pay $1500 a month living close to work.I have a decent job, I can afford it, I just don't want to.

No they didn't. Despair the movie's creative license, Apple gave Xerox a bunch of their stock in return for IP and even engineering help. This was back in the early 80s so Xerox made a mint. 
There was a P. Diddy quote somewhere about the best way to stop being prejudiced against a group of people "is exposing yourself to that group of people", paraphrasing obviously, can't seem to find the original exact quote :/

Seriously, the only thing keeping Superman from winning is his unwillingness to Kill Batman. If Superman wanted, he could fly into space, grab a meteor, and chuck it at Wayne when he's out and about and be done with it. Or he could simply fly into him at super-speeds, faster than any technology can track him, and literally rip a hole in Batman. The only thing stopping him is "He doesn't want to kill Batman".By that logic, I could say an actual Ant could defeat Superman, as long as Superman doesn't want to kill it.
Batman has a superpower.His superpower he illogically beats people that normal humans would lose to.
Dad you're embarrassing me in front of the Apple man!
Brett! Don't lemme catch you without a drink in your hand o.k., buddy? 
Jobs died of pancreatic cancer. Why do people keep saying it's curable?  Less than 5% of people diagnosed with it even survive more than 2 years.
> it only worked on the devices with higher-end RAM. My 16GB iPod touch (2nd Gen) couldn't handle it without a jailbreak.You had to jailbreak it to download more RAM ? 
I found it pretty intriguing how they did that presentation with 3 or 4 iPhones and that they had figured out what to do when in order to not crash the phone on-stage. It's literally how I do my presentations in college. Good to know I can still do this later in life and ~~not~~ make a billion bucks.
Yeah the iPhone camera wasn't actually decent until the 4S or so.Sony Ericsson also had the Walkman phones which were good music players, although with the UI limited by the lack of a touchscreen.But in the US most people had even shittier Motorola phones (because OMG razr so thin), so they really thought it was a step up.What the iPhone really did was bring all this stuff to the masses with an accessible capacitive touch UI.
Oh come on. At the time the original iPhone display was the most gorgeous display on a mobile device bar none, only the PSP came close to it in quality.
Funny you mention that, seeing how virtually all of the Apple Watch speed complaints are related to third-party software.

I saw a device with a capacitor that would discharge and fry the chips. Not sure if it was the Ironkey.
Then doors
I live an hour from work right now. I was at a job 15 minutes away that I had taken as far as it would go without giving that company another 10 years to have the infrastructure to handle anything new or fun. I took my new job simply because it has near unlimited possibilities if I run out of things to do again, gives me a chance to learn a new role, and has any amount of education I want ready to serve up for me. An hour drive isn't great, but between podcasts and working shifted hours to avoid traffic it really isn't bad.
Seriously. I didn't realize just how big of a quality of life impact long commutes were having at my new job until I noticed my commutes dropping from 60 minutes down to 30 during holiday seasons. It really feels great coming home with way more energy from shorter commutes. 
Cool! Which band/song?
I still currently have a Windows Phone, and I think it's starting to get a little fucky. I love it so much I'm getting anxiety about having to replace it and I don't even know for a fact that I have to.
wow, Ethan
He has a superpower: being the goddamn Batman
Brett! Where's that ribbon, buddy?
Truth. My grandad had it in his forties (fifty years ago at this point) and was treated in... Canada, I think? Caused a huge family rift because almost everyone but my grandmother wanted him to just come home to the farm.They were told he was being excluded from the hospital's statistics after he lived for another twenty years, because he skewed their data so badly it would give people false hope.I can't donate eggs because of it but you'd think you'd want genetics that let you beat unbeatable things lol.
Ironically, you needed to jailbreak so you could enable ZRAM/swap file and technically get more RAM. Still didn't help all that much though. 128MB was a bitch.
They wanted to avoid the Windows 95 keynote where it bluescreened in front of everyone...
Oh I know! It's just comically bad compared to what we have now.
Could you not just disconnect the capacitor first?
Right now, I listen to audiobooks on my commutes. It doesn't matter if it's a 15 minute commute or a 2 hour one, I enjoy the entire drive. If I could be watching a movie or an episode or two of a TV show, that would be pretty cool, too.
The Adored and I don't know which song, I've never actually encountered a Zune.  Probably called "Tell Me Tell Me""
great moves. keep it up. proud of you.
Depends on how you look at it. In the future we might have VR that can give you the feeling of physical contact. And then you could sit together and snuggle with someone halfway around the world. 
Thank you, glad you liked it!
Did you ever get that to work? It was like a dark art. I never got any benefit from it.

If you should ever personally get asked that question, the easy reply is to simply start asking increasingly personal questions. Or, if you want to be a bit more polite, ask for PINs and passwords and other login data. As soon as they refuse to answer, they've answered their own question.

Too bad she died young and he's just interacting with an echo of some stored behavioral patterns. After all the years, he slowly forgets what the original her was really like. Unfortunately, he doesn't notice.   
A couple times, but the issue was that it also caused some instability and in the end I'd always have to disable it. The best way to free up RAM back then was to remove unused launch daemons. Could free up to 50MB by doing that, because who used the iCloud stuff back when it was released, or the random developer services, or the Apple logs services, or the killswitch. Got close to 100MB of free RAM on my iTouch 2G by doing that. Could have music playing, a chat service app in the background, and browse the web with Safari with no apps closing!

Yeah, holy shit, this is a proper argument. Until you realize that most people who aren't immediately on Apple's side in this, most likely do not believe governments would do such things, nor that criminals would get their hands on it. Some people are seriously gullible when it comes to higher authorities than their own minds.
Citizen #8565425, it is our duty to report this free-thinking radical to the proper authorities.
In an ideal world, maybe. Some people will just double-down on their stance that the government is only here to protect us.
A romp and a riot 
Like that episode of Black Mirror
> you can just check in to a vacation VR place where you sit in a chair under a UV light and they feed your brain the sensations of...Transcendent bliss while they overclock your brain, so that you experience subjective centuries in a few hours.Then they unplug you 6 hours later and cart your body off for disposal
Yes.  My dog is AWESOME!!!  ;)  As far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life I would say no.  The bullying was only on camera.  The minute the director yelled cut I was definitely one of the "in crowd".  lol
Please don't say Jeremy Jamm.... 
Is there another way?  ;)
Not a note.  lol  :)
> Hey Tim,I see what you did there and I like it.
I think the "mugging" was a pretty bad day for Jerry.  He knew that if they found out what really happened (dropped a burrito in the creek) that he would take hell for days.  I love how he came up with the mugging story.  To think that he thought he could get away with it kills me.  :)
Great question.  From what I understand one of the writers were standing next to me at the urinal and thought it was time to mix real life and TV life.  Made perfect sense to me.  lol  ;)
We need to protect Jim <3
They were all funny.  What a lot of people don't know is that after every scene we did a "fun run".  That's where we got to play around and do whatever we wanted while telling the same story that was on the page.  Most of us had an improv background so it made sense to let us play together.  We did that EVERY DAY.  I think it's one of the reasons we stayed so close as a cast.  That being said...Chris Pratt is so off the cuff funny that it's crazy.  Really really funny.  I had fun working with each and ever one of them.  That's not Hollywood bullshit.  I loved them all...and still do.  :)
It's totally different than any other role I've played.  My character Lenny starts out in the same vein as Jerry from Parks.  A sweet, nice guy.  Unfortunately for Lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to Las Vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by Andrew J. West).  This turns his life upside down.  From that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude.  Playing the character was terrifying because if I didn't make it work the film doesn't work.  From what I hear I did it justice.  :)
I love when I get to different types of characters.  That's what actors do.  Like I mentioned earlier it's hard not to be typecast but it's part of the challenge of being an actor.  :)
I try to keep something from every shoot I'm on.  Most of it just sits in a box.  I figure someday when I'm old (well...older) I'll want to take a trip down memory lane.  I have the Jerry Gergich Conference Room RIP plaque on my desk.  I see it every day.  :)
You nailed it.  Li'l Sebastian will be starring as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men".  Can't wait to see it.  :)
I wouldn't say overly nice.  We were all just good friends doing good work and laughing our asses off every day.  :)
This is definitely the most important question I will answer today.  The answer is Rob Lowe.  I only say that because he has his own fragrance line and it would make sense that he smells better than the rest of us.  :)
My favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on Parks.  He had also worked on The Office.  His name is Dean Holland.  He really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us.My favorite actor that I've worked with is too broad of a question.  I've fallen in love with so many people I've worked with over the years.  By "love" I mean I loved being around them.  :)
LOL  That's a great analogy.  I'm not sure that's what I was thinking at the time but who knows?  As far as pulling classic Jerry moves....every day.  We all do.I won an Emmy last month and as I was walking up the steps to get the award I just kept thinking "don't fall...don't fall". If I had fallen it would have been another "Jerry" moment that I would hear about forever even though I won the award for a different show.  lol  :)
I've thought about this question many many times so credit for the question goes to me.  ;)  The answer is ... 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz.  :)
I thank God every day that the acting thing worked out.  Otherwise I have no idea what I'd be doing.  I guess because I'm a talker and a bit gregarious that I could have gone into sales but honestly I don't know.  A lot of my family around me are in the trades...like pipe coverers and fitters.  I'm too damn uncoordinated and lazy to do that so again...THANK YOU GOD FOR LETTING THIS WORK OUT!!!!!  :)
Totally thought up by Aubrey during the last commercial break.  My favorite part when watching the video is how the other cast members reacted when they realized what was happening.Aubrey is a super funny person.  She knew it wouldn't be funny to make out with Pratt or Scott.  She knew it had to be with the old fat guy to get the real laugh.  I was happy to oblige.  :)
The joke was funny but his laugh made it legendary
I typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions".  ;)
I get my pizza with sausage, onion, extra sauce and crispy.  mmmmm  Now I've got to have pizza today.  :)
YES!  Put it to bed.  ;)
I've never been able to see if I have mumps.  When I go to look I'm always distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.  ;)
Seconding this. How does it feel making all of us jealous ?
Nothing but nature that night.  I didn't know that was going to happen.  Aubrey leaned over and said "you wanna make out during the Li'l Sebastian song".  Within .01 seconds I said yes.  As a guy who doesn't get roles as the romantic lead I listened to Rob Lowe's advice.  Just follow whatever the girl does.  So when we started kissing and I felt Aubrey tongue make its move I knew all bets were off.  lolI'll be on Seth Meyers next Wednesday, June 14th.  Check it out.  Maybe Aubrey will surprise me and we'll make out again.  mmmm  ;)
I'm obviously not him but I think the show ended perfectly. I don't know if they can top that ending.
Thank you so much.  I love that scene too.Any Jerry's on the crew?  YES!  Because I love them all so much I will not name names but I can tell you that there was the occasional mishap caused by the same person many times.  lol  Of course we still loved him.  :)
My best bud was Retta (Donna).  Our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them.  Our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so I think that bonded us right off the bat.  We were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out.  I had lunch with Retta last week.  She's one of my favs in life.  :)
Awesome question.  Really something I've never thought about.  I would say that initially they would get along great.  They're both very devoted to family and inherently good people.  The journey that Lenny ends up on is not something Jerry would ever go along with so their friendship wouldn't last.A night out for them would definitely involved a sundae.  :)
Awesome question.  WOW!  I'm not sure which way to go.  On one had Pratt has turned himself into a physical machine.  On the other hand Nick is very smart and might be able to outmaneuver Chris.  Damn...I have to go with a draw.  :)
HUGE Billy Joel Fan.  I was on a show yesterday talking about his song "My Life" as one of my all time favorites.  Billy tries to avoid me because of the Christie Brinkley issue.  He knows I could have taken her away from him.  EASY!  lol  ;)
DJ Roomba haunts my dreams.   I still wake up thinking I hear him coming down the hall.  Even talking about it now has me on edge.  ;)
The Kardashian outtake is one of the funniest moments I've ever experience on any set ever.  Chris Pratt is so damn funny and he hits you with it when you least expect it. For those who don't know what I'm talking about just go to You Tube and type in Parks and Rec and Kardashian.  You'll love it.  :)
While I'm doing this REDDIT I've also been texting with the cast of P&R.  I have a Parks Fam text link on my phone.  We're always in contact whether it's to break balls or share what's going on with our lives.  The love you see on the screen only works because it was real off screen.  :)
The popular answer is going to be Offerman but IMO it's Aubrey Plaza.
I'm a big television watcher.  There is so much amazing TV going on right now.  Walking Dead...VEEP...Game Of Thrones...House Of Cards...Shameless and a ton of others.  I'm pretty busy but with all the new ways to watch TV on our difference devices I've been able to keep up.Also, playing with and hanging with my dogs just makes me happy.  I also like to read and play the occasional round of golf.  :)
I hope not.  They're too sweet to be hounds of hades.  ;)
I love them too.  Thank you.  They love to roll and creative tons of dirt in my house. lol  When they play fight it gets so intense that sometimes I think they must have hurt each other.  They run at full speed and just smack into each other.  Two seconds later they do it again and their tales are wagging.  Crazy but so fun to watch.  They both love the dog park too.  And of course walks.  :)
You saw me in Roseanne?  That's awesome.  Unfortunately I've never been on that show.  lol  But seriously, I used to watch Roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no.  You must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy.  ;)  As far as the reboot goes...I'm not sure.  Some things are better left alone.  :)
Fart Attack is definitely classic.I like the old school original with Mark Brandanowicz.  We were playing a game in the office that Jerry never wanted to play.  We had to dig dirt up on each other.  Jerry finally relents and says to Mark "I hear you've got two unpaid parking tickets" (big f'ing deal) and Mark says "I hear your adoptive mother smokes pot".  He looks at me and realizes he's hit a nerve.  He says "I'm sorry.  You didn't know your mom smoked pot?"  Jerry says..."I didn't know I was adopted".  The first and best burn for me.  :)
There were so many outtakes that should NEVER see the light of day.  lol  We did some filthy silly stuff sometimes.  On the other hand we also all had our moments of brilliance when we were doing a fun run so I'm sure there's some stuff that I've forgotten that would have been fun to see in the show.  Ultimately our co creator Mike Schur always did what was best for the show.  He would never put in a guaranteed laugh if it didn't move the story forward. :)
Aubrey and I dated for ten years before we eventually broke up due to a side relationship I was having with Joan Calamezzo.  It wasn't easy on any of us and I take full responsibility for the breakup.  That being said it didn't help with Aubrey started dating Joe from the Sewage Department.  That really hurt.  ;)  lol
Don't avoid...EMBRACE!!!!!!  :)
I just heard about that minutes ago.  I feel terrible.  She was a very very sweet lady.  For those who don't know Glenne played Ben's mother on Parks.  We had a lot of fun with her son set.  What a shame.  She was way too young.  :(
Final seasons (and episodes) are tough.  I think the pressure to go out with an amazing story is tough to do.  I know I'm biased but I think that the writers at Parks nailed it.  I love the time jump and the fact that we get to see where these characters end up.  Some of my favorites shows didn't quite nail it for me but Parks did.  Again...I'm a bit biased.  lol  :)
Of course you were, barry
When the writers realized that Jerry was going to be the office punching bag they also realized that they had to give him some reason not to blow his head off. lol They decided that ultimately Jerry would have the best life of any one of the characters.  Jerry's wife and kids adored him and thought he did no wrong.  Don't forget...they also gave him a huge penis.  I like when real life and TV life come together.  ;)
He just has to have a pill inserted in it every hour for the rest of his life.
You've been JAMMED!  ;)
God, Jerry you don't deserve the internet.
You and H Jon Benjamin should put out an album together then.  
Because we're all going to run out and watch it anyway in support of him.*Obviously.*
You responding to my question while I'm at work makes this one of the best days at the office for me, thanks!
I remember there was a bit in Nick Offerman's first book about how Hollywood types were baffled when he started doing any kind of comedy because he was originally a theater guy. I've always really enjoyed it myself when an actor I love steps out of their typical bounds. Definitely gonna have to look into Middle Man.
Was it the guy who played the doctor?
Classic Terry.
Any "off the cuff" examples you can give?
He also loves Tammy 2 irl
That's pretty much it.  Nick is such a great guy and so is Ron.  They just took Nick to an nth degree.  What he did with that character was something I have never seen on another show.  I've always been confused on why he never received an Emmy for his work.  :)
I just want to comment that you ending your comments with smiley faces makes me envision your goofy happy smile on Parks and Rec when Jerry is showing off his family to (I think) Leslie for the first time and that makes me smile too
> (well...older)You are becoming one of my favorite people. 
Murinals* FTFY
Jerry, I hate to break it to you but... Li'l Sebastian is dead 
Damn.  Should have read this before my previous comment.  I guess Nick and Lil' Sebastian are going to have to fight this one out.  :)
That's awesome! Thanks for answering Tim :)
'Literally'. By Rob Lowe."It's LITERALLY, the best fragrance."
Not a lot, but it does get a lot of comments like "I had to downvote you because you don't like the same TV show I do."  
I'm sure they "loved" being around the two of you. ;)
Nice humble brag, Jerry. 
From what I've read, Aubrey asked Jim during a break while taping if he wanted to do it during the song.  I mean, who's going to say no to that anyway?
I heard somewhere that Jerry Gurgich has the biggest penis a doctor had ever seen. The doctor was there to check for mumps but forgot to even look because **he was so distracted by the biggest penis he'd ever seen**
Holy crap, can't believe you actually answered me!  Thank you!In all seriousness though, my wife and I loved Parks and Rec immensely.  We went through some really tough times due to medical complications, but you guys were always there to cheer us up.  For a lot of people TV shows are an escape, but Parks and Rec will always be something more for us.  Thanks to you and the rest of the cast for helping us when we needed it most. 
r/onionlovers welcomes you with open arms <3
More like put her to bed amiright!
Haha thanks for responding! I will check out your new movie and try not to let your above average acting skills distract me from the plot. 
I'm uncomfortable.
Let Scrubs serve as a testament to this truth, spoken here on this day.
I love this because Donna also showed Jerry so much warmth on the show (in her own way). It makes me so happy that you're pals outside the show.
I figured the popular answer probably would've been Chris Pratt but I was kinda hoping it was Aziz Ansari
As great as the AMA is, this is probably my favorite exchange.Mistaken for another actor, still responds in the nicest possible way. You're alright, Tim. 
God damn are you charming. 
Classic Barry. 
Brendanawicz, obviously
> they also gave him a huge penis.  I like when real life and TV life come together.  ;)Damn Jerry, you such a pimp.
I completely agree.  The episode where Jerry retires and Leslie comes over to talk with him because she felt like they didn't give him a good farewell was one of my favorites.  Leslie sees how Jerry is adored by h is family.  She also sees that he's awesome around his house.  He's funny, smart, quick reflexes.  Leslie acts likes she's been thrown to some other dimension.  The writers on Parks always knew how to handle each situation.  I thought it was a brilliant idea.  :)
Many people have told me that they work without someone who is basically the office punching bag.  I seems that every office needs that person to take the fall for everything.  Unfortunately for Jerry it was his burden to take on.  That being said...I do believe that Jerry truly loved all of his co-workers and knew that deep down they all had his back.  As much as family was most important to Jerry he also adored all the people he worked with.  Even when they weren't being especially kind.  
True Dat!!!!!!  ;)
I remember that tweet.  sniff sniff  lol  ALL GOOD!!!!!  :)
I know where he's coming from though. Having someone just sneak a photo of you without you even knowing is much more invasive feeling. As someone not famous I hate when people at parties are snapping photos for instagram. Who knows what I may have been doing or saying during those moments. I won't until I see it on Instagram or Facebook.
I want to see the saga of Gary Gergich, Mayor of Pawnee. 
God dammit Terry the line is "You just got Jammed".
Let the record show there was a standing ovation. 
The internet don't deserve Larry.
I didn't know I wanted this.Now I know I'll never have it.Why do you do this?Who hurt you?
I'm just now watching it and the surprise cameos are one of the best parts of the show.  Between Mr. Oheir and like every side character from Its Always Sunny, its been amazing.
I was distracted
I was distracted by the **largest penis** I have ever seen
Nick Offerman doesn't act, he's just himself and people film him.
Wrestlers always say the best character is always your real personality turned up to 10. That definitely explains Ron Swanson, but now I'm starting to wonder about Steve Carrell...
Seriously. He's been replying to child comments as well as threads and he's been giving full paragraph responses with in depth thought. This is the best AMA ever with the sweetest guy. 
So is Lenny 
Are you suggesting that anyone besides maybe Ben Wyatt, Human Disaster, would ever lift a hand against Lil' Sebastian?  The very thought is rocking me to my core right now.
This made me think of Nick Offerman giggling. 
Punctuation can fix that.Doctor, who is overrated? 
RIP Harris.
God damnit why doesn't she ever ask ME to hardcore make out? 
You're darn right he has!
Did you just pee yourself? Just a Dab... You nasty Jerry.
Dunno, we see a very different side of him on Master of None, which I think is probably closer to him IRL.
Her personality was a gift to the writing staff.
Classic Larry.
More like BrendanaQUITZ.
Whenever he said "you've been jammed!" With the little twitch, I would laugh so hard
Technically I'm homeleeeessss~*
I read this in Tom's voice
+1000 points for actually responding to comments. kudos to you Jim, and to /u/CIPHERSTONE 
The absolute confusion on Leslie's face. Good times. 
My favorite scene was when jerry told Chris that before having kids, he looked pretty mu ch like Chris. In one short part of a scene we see chris' psyche shatter again and see a glimpse of Jerry's backstory
The relationship between Ben and Jerry (heh) was so awesome. I loved how Ben was so much more conscious of how terrible Jerry was treated by everyone, and then Jerry noticed that Ben noticed, and would stop Ben from intervening and in a subtle way would let him know it's OK and he's used to it.Such awesome chemistry between characters in that show.
I love you Jim O'Heir
Omg bless your soul, Jim. I'm not even religious and I can't think of another thing to say. You're the best.
Retro Jamm
H Jon Benjamin did  a solo album.  check it out
Who other than Artemis? I've only recently started watching it's always sunny so I have probably missed the connections !
I literally read it in Aziz Ansari's voice before I even knew what it said so yeah I agree. 
Uh, yeah, have you seen Terry's wife? 
by the largest penis I've ever seen.
I know it's supposed to be a crazy reveal, but in the hunting episode he says he has brothers... Something like "I usually watch the football game with my brothers on thanksgiving, maybe you can come over and shoot me in the head!"So it wasn't the surprise that the joke was supposed to be, and how he was like "ugh, yes I have a brother. ONE brother"... Made no sense
But bro! I gotta get those likes and pop off some "hey cuties" 
This is a /r/loudgif
I agree.  Master of None (which is BRILLIANT) is more like Aziz in my opinion.  I love watching him do his thing on that show.  He also writes it with Alan Yang who was one of our Parks writers.  Two really smart guys for sure.  :)
Really? That's surprising to me considering the way he acts and how enthusiastic he is in his comedy shows. I guess things aren't always as they seem.
Classic Terry
Classic Cheryl/Carol
I'm sorry I called you Brendanaquitz
The showrunners also did not have favorable things to say about him.  It says quite a bit that Brendanaquitz is never mentioned again after he leaves, as if the writers are just erasing him from memory.
I'd just like to note that your choice of punctuation captures his distinctive vocal tone *extraordinarily* well.
Boom! Two ankle bracelets. The judge said it's the first time he's ever had to do that. Uh, ja boiz a question on the baaaaar exaaaaam~!
I just realized they had Tom and Jerry :O
Kudos to Tim!
"That man has the largest penis I have ever seen. I don't even know if he has mumps. I was distracted. By the largest penis... I have ever seen."
I'd like to start my day the Gergich way. Now give me all the bacon and eggs you have. 
That plus Ben's near obsession with how he was married to his wife were just perfect.
S5 ep9"Ron and Diane"
By the later seasons Ben was essentially a permenant break in the fourth wall. He was an extension of the viewer, reacting how a normal person would to all the ludicrous behavior. And I loved that.
We're going with Tim now 
There was only ever one possibility. And yet, it's always worth the rewatch.
Consider this a lesson learned about the importance of headphones.
Yes.  A time share in Muncie can certainly sway a girls head.  But Jerry's other "head" is what probably turned her head.  lol
I'm understanding now why everyone on the cast of Parks and Recreation has always had such wonderful things to say about you. You have a wicked sense of humour and such a positive outlook. 
He wrote a lot of his storyline
The Waitress, Gail the Snail, Bill Ponderosa, Uncle Jack off the top of my head
I have three nannies suing me right now. One of them for no reason
Still poop
Yah it was a talk with most of the cast and the head writer and someone asked what the funniest joke was in their opinion. And the writer was like goddamn Chris just came up with it
Whoa, it's Jim! Thank you for confirming!
Yes, it's fantastic!
Classic Cherlene
He quit. Then Chris and Ben were written in and the show reached new levels of awesome.
I think alao because there was probably no chance of a return that they figured best to remove him
I read this in Chris' voice. 
Maybe my favorite Jean Ralphio quote of them all. I mean its pretty hard to choose. but this may be his best moment. 
Money please! 
Also Ben and Jerry
Wait, wait. I worry what you just heard was "Give me a lot of bacon and eggs." What I said was, "Give me all the bacon and eggs you have."Do you understand?
Oh yeah. I love that. He just brings it up from time to time. 
Actually the one they're talking about is 'Jerry's retirement', s5 ep20.
No normal person would have the genius to create The Cones of Dunshire.
Nah, they coulda been jealous of that burrito he fell into the river for. 
lmao you're awesome, Jim.
the lucky bastard
You should hear some of his podcast appearances. He's a natural. He seriously needs to make his own podcast!
I mean, shit, in real life, and in pretty much any other role, she's definitely pretty. Roxy in Scott Pilgrim? C'mon!
Actually, Paul Lieberstein disliked being on camera, so Toby usually had very few lines in the episodes he wrote. I think Mindy Kaling is responsible for a lot of Toby's shining moments.
I find many writers who insert themselves into shows really try and make fun of themselves. The creator of Workaholics always makes subtle jokes about whatever ~~Kyle~~Karl is doing at the time. I think he's the writer...
I read this in Archer's voice
OUTLAW COUNTRY WOOOOOOOO
MONEY PWEASEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
man it's too early for this shit and I'm tripping hard
holy shit this is mindblowing
Tell me more about your memories of Raggedy Anne and Andy.
Ben (stands on chair): I like Larry!  He is a good friend, and a fine man, with an inexplicably gorgeous wife, I mean, to the point where it makes no sense at all, sorry, getting off track, he is a nice person!  And we should all stand up, and say **I...like...**Tom: Ben! No! What are you doing!?
They did. Jerry has a huge penis.
Ben: "So Gayle and Jerry...?"Chris: "Yeah I've thought about it a lot, there's no logical explanation"
Come on, he was the one who laughed the hardest at Chris Pratt's comeback joke!
That is hilarious
Like when he sensually touches Pam's leg, realizes his mistake, and in a moment of pure awkward panic decides to announce his move to Costa Rica. To escape the awkwardness, he proceeds to hop a 10ft fence and jog home (possibly miles? lol), leaving his car in the trapped parking lot.Yeah Mindy wrote that episode.
Everyone who worked in the annex early on, not in the last season, was a writer. It let them not need to be on screen at all times but still in the show!
Karl*FTFY
He also said he used to look like IIRC Chris before he married Gayle in one episode. Dude was a catch. 
Fun fact, it's Mae Whitmans birthday
I knew they were all writers, but I never put together why it made sense they were all together. No idea how I didn't put that together. Thanks!
Another TIL
I think you mean Gary.
Christy Brinkley was fantastic in that role too. Her constant joy and grace was perfect. 
Kinda makes all the jokes where the main staff (actors) make fun of the weirdos in the annex (writers) a little better too! :)
Wikileaks twitter linked to a conspiracy site which claims Hillary had a seizure AND sent hand signals to Lester Holt during the debate (truepundit) to push the idea that Hillary wanted to "drone Assange." This random sketchy right wing propaganda site became the "source" for this report that got reported the world over because of Wikileaks.That's just an example
> Why did you attack the Panama papers when they showed dodgy money flowing into Russian coffers? Can you source this? I remember it vaguely but wasn't able to find it when I last went looking. I'd like to know of a specific source for my usage. 
Yeah...timing it just as Jeff Sessions hearing is started...
I'm not trying to imply any of my bias toward Hannity or Fox News. I tried to use the least amount of words as possible to ensure that. I'm just curious as to why Mr. Assange's recent interviews have been with Hannity. If he wants to answer, I'd still like to know.
Is this AMA his first "public" appearance since his disappearance? If so, it's a pretty weird way to come back...
You're looking at the plan: deny deny deny. 
Surprise surprise, "Julian" ignores every good question in this thread. 
Can you explain for the curiosity of those of us that don't follow anything wiki leaks related, what does this all mean?
That's so fucking retarded, holy shit.Why not just provide hashes for both?
So, Wikileaks has the habit of first posting a hash of insurance files on twitter, hashes are made so that one file makes one short(ish) string of letters and numbers ("4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809") that no other file can duplicate if it goes through the same process.  Wikileaks has released these hashes a while ago, then published files that seem to belong to the hashes, but if we run the process to check if the files are the same, they aren't.That means that either what we think goes together doesn't, or that the file has been changed
Yes. They are hashes of plain text leaks. Not encrypted leaks (insurance file)
Indeed. Not really a Reddit AMA if it's on Twitch.
WLTaskForce has been harassing journalists, threatening to sue critics for libel, and threatening to make doxxing lists of people. They've been trying to use LinkedIn to slander people for ever working with government or talking to people in government etc.It's like the brownshirts. These neo-fascists should be banned from twitter. **Their goal is not to release information to make people informed. It's to release information to undermine democracy and replace it with Russian-aligned fascism.**
No, I did not expect him to. Assange is a coward and a hypocrite. 
Folks who frequent r/wikileaks just call them shills and not mods and are almost certain that the sub is compromised...WL itself is still up for debate. Hopefully the AMA settles it.
Okay, /r/WikiLeaks is a scam then.
That's pretty much exactly what OP did, bruh. 
Broke Wikileaks encryption? These people know how to use PKI and, I am certain, correct encryption techniques. Something stinks here.If breaking current strong encryption methods was so easy, governments would not be making laws against the use of such technologies.I'm suspicious.
Some of the proof for this is elsewher on this thread. In essence it boils down to them calling panama papers leaks irresponsible for how they were not releasing if all at once. The irony... 
'Transparency'
I just tried it, and not only that, but it will not allow 'p@ssw0rd'.  I tried 'Runner4567' and it was happy with that, however.
I'm surprised Wikileaks isnt held to the same standard of transparency they hold the rest of the world too.
That's because Julian is actually a self-serving scumbag. 
Why did you insinuate Seth Rich leaked the DNC documents?
Because that's how you end up with polonium in your tea.
> WL is about the free flow of information and releasing everything/anything after vetting - not political pandering.Er, should be about.
The fact that this question has the most upvotes but continued to be ignored makes it even more fishy. 
So far, it seems like he took this question and answered a different question that he wanted to answer.I guess he is just a politician like the rest of them.
It was my birthday!
PGP signed shoe on head or assange is dead.
Yes he did. He skipped the top three questions and went straight to the question involving how his October was.
Only a SYNTH deals in absolutes.
A cryptographic nonce is just an arbitrary number or string that is used once. It is there to prevent a signed message prepared before this AMA.
And here I am, liking reddit for Mr. Poopy Butthole references.
Because Hannity fellates him for free
It's not. He's had a few interviews since October. Just last week with Sean Hannity.
For real. Wikileaks is fucked, every effort to discover whether or not it's been compromised over the last four months has been met with absolute silence, the staff members AMA a while back was just as much of a shit-show as this one is turning out to be...theres no way they can be viewed as unbiased at this point, if their information can even be trusted at all.
That was the clear takeaway from this AMA. 
It means that the files were not posted through the normal method. They could have been put up by someone else, or be a form of distress signal that wikileaks has been infiltrated, or maybe just a mistake. But the refusal to acknowledge it indicates it's probably not the last one.
or, you know, the entire point of providing the same hashes is to prove that it is the same payload... any deviation from this, no matter how handwaved or explained away it is, is literally the only proof we have of tampering
ITS REDDIT NOT WATCHDIT
No they fired that person a while ago.
Exactly. And if Assange does not take a stand it damages Wikileaks' credibility. That is, if it is indeed true that WL Task Force has no official role in WL. Which is not supported by it being verified on Twitter and calling themselves official.
The sub is completely taken over by pro Trump nonsense, of course it's compromised. 
...and Here4Popcorn is entirely full of shit. Got it. 
In this case I I get it - there was a lot of speculation that JA was dead or otherwise neutralized, and a real time AMA was the only way to prove his answers were coming from him. Although there will still be people who claim it's digitally altered, a body double, etc. 
OP never actually said the words "calling it" so therefore it was still up for grabs
Or they could have had an idea for what their password was, and needed to brute force variations of it.  When we lost our room mate to a vehicle accident we had to do the same thing to his Bitcoin wallet to give it to his family. The chance of breaking it from scratch was near zero but from his LastPass that was left open we seeded it with words that he commonly used. Sure enough it was a variant of one of them.
This.  After being a supporter of wikileaks I watched them take a partisan role and help Republicans while hiding whatever info they had on them.  I have lost what respect I had and no longer trust them in any way. 
When you choose the content you release/disclose/present you can't be unbiased in the first place.  
All due respect, is everything ok on your side of Twitch? There's currently a WL animation playing and (rather vitriolic) spam comments but that's about it
I switched mine to "p@ssw0rd" with no issue. So, there's that. I live in LA, not sure if there might be regional differences.edit. I was incorrect, I changed it to "p@ssword", which is allowed, but "p@ssw0rd" is not. very odd.
Now what the hell do you think he'll answer to this?
Hey, it's better than Splenda. 
Isn't Assange in the Ecuador embassy in England? How is Russia protecting him?
Quite this.Wikileaks is obviously NOT about this anymore. How you can claim to be independently trustworthy while pursuing your own political motives is very questionable.
That's what every person giving a public answer does. It's public speaking 101. If you don't like a question, say a filler phrase like "that's a good question" or "Well, look" and then give the answer to the question you want to answer.
Yeah, my response is always "Let me look through your phone, check your browser history and install a webcam in your bedroom then."
I knew WikiLeaks is run by the fuckin' Danish. 
Happy belated birthday!
But if the shoe is on his head, it's off his foot. Still dead.
They want Assange to prove cryptographically, in a way that can't be faked by other parties, that he is alive and well. 
He kind of just addressed this question, but definitely not the way anyone would have wanted. It seemed like his answer was basically... if they were actually in trouble, then the keys would probably be compromised, so if he releases the key as proof and people take it as such, then people wouldn't fight to protect him? Very odd answer. 
Nope. You are asking for what we are. There is no proof at all yet and according to Julian and wikileaks, the only acceptable form of Proof of Life, is crytographically pgp signed messages and live streaming video. None of which has been produced in any way whatsoever. Not even a half assed attempt has been made.
unless of course, /u/g2n is a prepared messenger for a prepared message. 
Oooooooohweeeeee me too 
That's what people mean by fake news. It's literally random idiots posting bullshit. People actually think this is legitimate news, just look at the comments at the bottom and the fact that *wikileaks retweeted this site*
i think you nailed it.  and the fact that the AMA does not answer this question makes me believe it's a distress signal.
I agree with you. I still think it's retarded especially given the fact they *did* deviate with the salting of the files. If Wikileaks gets taken down, the insurance files are never going to *be* decrypted. Why *not* provide both hashes?
Bring her back 
"Dubs gets mod"
Pretty sure one of the "new" mods was/is a r/the_donald mod. Another is a r/conspiracy mod. And another is a r/dncleaks mod. They all post shit in r/wikileaks that has everything to do with their other moderator subs. The sub is crap now and I have called out the "old" mod for adding these people with their non-wikileaks agendas.
Judging by the slant, I wonder __*which government*__?
Some of their mods pretended that one of them had been in touch with WL. Knowlingly spreading information that is false while pretending you are closer to the source is toxic for WL and the community that cares about it.
He is answering on live stream not in the thread. 
> How does that promise safeguard Wikileaks from selectively weaponising information for the personal benefits/desires of the person in charge?It doesn't. It enables them to do so when their handles see fit.
The wikileaks team is in control of the twitch channel right now - the graphic is coming from them. Hopefully they'll get things figured out soon. They are surprisingly technically challenged, considering who they are.
They've been told they need to have written responses too. We're hoping they get around to posting them eventually. 
Nothing, because sadly AmA's aren't a good format for in-depth questions as there's typically not a back-and-forth conversation but just an answer from the AmA'er to the question, twisted towards the one (s)he wants to answer.
>Wikileaks has been quite accurate, and if they were engaged in propaganda, that would indicate ***they're spreading fake information.***Propaganda, by definition, doesn't have to be fake. 
> That is the end of this incredibly weird AMA in which you have to focus all the time in order to somehow know what question he is now answeringFTFYYeah, I'll wait for the transcripts.
Those are the kind of people that can't foresee that a government could become oppressive. While you think your government is benign everything is fine and dandy. However in a blink of an eye your government can change and you could become an outlier.
>I love pooping with the door open.  Real freedom.
Part of the problem with Assange  (apart from this train wreck of an AMA) is that his philosophy of 'No privacy' is doomed. Unless the human race undergoes a monumental shift in the way out functions, the like of which can barely be imagined, there will always be someone who wants to keep information from someone else in order to increase their own power. Assange is tilting at windmills.
Is there somewhere I could read more about the aftermath of this? I was following the power/internet bit, but didn't know about the mod changes and hash releases stopping. Is 92318DBA the key they'd been signing things with before that date?The ability to sign something like /u/g2n's request wouldn't demonstrate a huge amount that the key isn't compromised, but the refusal to do so sends one heck of a message, to me.
Sharpie in PGP signed pooper
They can, that's why he's asking people to make copies.
that's assuming that nobody got his private keys
This is basically Julian's own private warrant canary. If he won't provide it (as he has told us he would in the past) then he is comprimised. 
It's turtles all the way down 
That's the thing. We can't. This is a false litmus test. If he has been physically compromised, his private key can also be compromised. There was concern that the hash of the insurance file changed recently as well. Full disclosure, I personally believe this is Assange, and if it was not, we would be able to tell.
The far right propagandists have co-opted the term to muddy its actual meaning by using it to describe any report they disagree with.                          Please just call them tabloids. The century-old word for made-up-published-nonsense. Trump supporters read tabloids. Batboy. Alien pregnancy. Child sex dungeon in a pizza parlor. Tabloids.                 ps I've now seen Trumpets on the internet referring to CNN as a tabloid, so I guess they're reading my posts? 
What is TPTB?
It would be nice to get answers in the actual thread so we don't have to watch a stream for an AMA. 
I don't see how people can deny that wikileaks is a partisan organization.
Just like that shirts target audience. 
Yup. You nailed it. Julian is no the very thing he created Wikileaks to fight. Blind unaccountable power that's manipulating people and information.
it's a dog whistle for jewish people commonly used among white supremacists.
Apologies for bothering you but would there be any way to tell the WL side to turn up his mic? Can barely hear him
Yeah, stupid way of doing an AMA. I'll be waiting for transcripts or even a full video later. 
It is damn near impossible to follow what's going on :/
Great. My dog is apparently using Reddit now.
Also the voter registration info of _literally almost every single woman in Turkey_
Yes, but there is also a part about some new from yesterday.
All keys (like this)  are paired.  There is a public key and a private key.  Since Julian has released his public key he certainly has the private key that accompanies it. No one knows what his private key is unless he told someone or it was stolen/compromised. Think of it like a password. He uses the password to encrypt some message. The message can be decrypted only using the public key he supplied.
Yeah, it's not a perfect proof. 
That is my thinking. He is not in control of the key anymore and knows signing will give the key credibility again.
I think it's important to differentiate between actual tabloids who report on real news with a strong spin (The Sun, Daily Mail) and fake news websites like truepundit that make shit up to make money off of ads or influence public opinion.
The Powers That Be.
In a sense they're making a similar mistake as Trump and the DNC, trying to utilize the ignorance of certain demographics to bolster their own power. "We dont agree with them but we can sell them something they think they agree with and take their money for our purposes." Historically, this tends to backfire spectacularly.
That's really weird, but I guess racists are inherently weird people.
We're working on it. They're not super easy to communicate with.
He's answering them on a livestream 
>Also the voter registration info of literally almost every single woman in TurkeyI can't believe it
far from it I would say... only one way can assure you that he is ok.. go live with him for at least a few weeks.
It's a proof of correct transfer of the file they intend to release, nothing more. If they want to tamper with the file and have you verify you got the edited version, that is up to them. Typically these measures are used when it is likely that a third party has interest in tampering with the communication. This principle is therefore used in situations where safe communication is essential, such as online banking.
Thank you!
Well, it makes sense from their perspective. Most neo-nazi fascists believe that an elite cabal of Jews control all major sources of information and especially the main stream media (MSM). Textbooks, publishing, TV, movies, etc. They also believe that the Jews have huge amounts of either paid or purposely ignorant people spreading disinformation through social media. Triple parenthesis help identify who those people are, so you can ignore them. Because in their world, those people are shills or enemies. 
Have you tried typing in Russian?*Spaceba for the gold, tovarisch. Real horosho.
For a bunch of folks who think they're the master race, they sure do seem to hold the Jews in much higher esteem than themselves.
It's a lot easier to commit violence against someone who you have no sympathy for.In a way, it's kind of related to dehumanization.
I think the answer to that is clear and I'll let you fill in the blanks.
Thank you, and I'm glad I'm your favorite actor. You have my favorite user name of anybody I've ever seen. It was an easy decision. Once Paul Greengrass said he wanted to do it, I was in, but we didn't have a story. I mean it was nine years in the making because we didn't want to force it if it wasn't there, and so once we realized it was there we all jumped on board, but before that it was an agonizing process as we tried to figure out if there even was a story to tell. 
My favorite show as a kid was *Chips*, I loved Erik Estrada, Ponch and John, you know. I used to get on my bike, and my mother actually sewed blue lines down a pair of chinos that I had so that I could have the tan pants with the blue lines that the California highway patrol, and get on my Huffy and ride around the neighborhood.
omg. I'm making tacos tonight. I hope he responds soon so I can make Damon tacos!
Happiness. 
Stuck Two You?
Looks like we ran out of time.
Lol, all of Matt's scenes were off Earth in "Interstellar," I highly doubt they would send Nolan into space just to direct a few scenes. 
I agree but for what it's worth, I'd want you to win instead
> You have my favorite user name of anybody I've ever seen.        Ouch.
Good Guy Matt Damon. Answers the question, thinks of a follow up, and answers it too.
username checks out
> By the end of the film, it has become **so widespread and popular** that Scotty's best friend Cooper is **able to use it as his cell phone ring tone**.Oh, the early 00s!
Thanks. Now I have the theme song in my head.
You can see him literally deflate as soon as he calls him Matt Damon
That's exactly what he said.
What do you smell like?
Nailed it!
If that is truly the case, the director's cut on the DVD will redeem the film, right?  Hopefully.
Yea but there just isn't time any left
Jesse Plemons who also played Todd from Breaking Bad.  Yeah I get that a lot too
He was wicked smaht in that one.
Yeah, I'm glad to see such solid answers. Guy seems down-to-earth.
I'm sure his 4-bet range is optimal. 
I'd love to be a fly on the wall the moment they saw the puppet for the first time.
Yeah, it was cheaper to rewrite the character as retarded than to remake the marionette.
When I saw he had an AMA, I immediately shouted MAHT DAYMON in my head. It's permanently ingrained. 
I think it's funny that in the answer he gave above, he clearly doesn't remember the answer he gave before.
So I guess Matt wouldn't be interested in a role as Robin, or..?
friends for 35 years.. honestly never knew that they were friends for that long until today. that's like BFFFFF status.
Do we have any more pot?
It's not your fault.
It's also a sweet chef name
Are you the guy who couldn't spell his name correctly?
This is the greatest moment in my life.
Now I know why we keep saving him. Godspeed, Matt. God. Speed.
I don't think he knows what a Reddit party is like.
Reddit Baltimore meetup
I like to imagine that's just an alt account Matt uses on days he's in drag, browsing the internet and feelin' pretty.
This IAmA just started and he is responding greatly, really appreciate his words. 
Miami Vice is number one show in Bratislava! 
That Jesse James movie with Brad Pitt is pretty good.
That was the movie I realized that Ben is much better director than actor... and that his little bro ended up with all the acting talent.
> You know, I never really thought about it this way, but that has got to be one of my absolute favorite things about your Bourne movies.I think it is the basis of Krav Maga. Use what you can.
> Additionally, I'm relieved to hear directly from you that you don't go around whacking people with a rolled up magazine in real life.Really? I'm a little disappointed. 
Holy taco, Matt Damon's AMA is the best in awhile....a huge paragraph just on he likes his fucking tacos. I love this guy.
Matt Damon has spoken to my inner spirit o what a taco really is.
There's a dope mexican restaurant in chicago that has a menu item called "white boy tacos" and he kind of just described it. I believe it's the hard shell that makes it unauthentic.
"Sweet lady Cholula" is what we call her.
I almost think he was processing whether he was offended or complimented. 
Right!? At first it was funny to see the doppelganger but when Paul Tag actually pointed it out it was too much.
The impact carries well beyond just having clean water/sanitation.  African women & children mostly would spend up to 8 hours a day just hauling water from far off points.  Those hours can now be used for education and other areas that better life.  In the west it's hard to understand the level of work involved for people to gain the most basic of needs.  The impact is exponential.
Hey, aren't you that guy wh- ah forget it.
Matt Damon
Nah I want to imagine her musk too. 
It's pretty great. The sad thing is Ben loved the film that he was making.
 It's not your fault. 
Hell yes. I am now imagining Matt Damon smiling to himself at random points saying "I'm someone's Robin Williams." 
Ya I think /u/TheIronGiants meant, "I know a game **in** development," just a typo.  
Well good luck pressing "Take Off", then "Autopilot", then "Land"!
IT OKAY... DON'T BE CRY..
My boy's wicked smart.
Millary Dank!!!
that is an amazing catch
*opens oven*Matt:  Well, shit.Trey:  What?Matt: Matt Damon! He looks retarded!Trey: Fucknuggets!  What are we supposed to do with a retarded Matt Damon?Matt: Retarded Matt Damon?Trey: Retarded Matt Damon!Matt Damon:  Matt Damon!
> Yeah, it was ~~cheaper~~ funnier to rewrite the character as retarded than to remake the marionette.
Actually, according to their interviews, they left the puppet mold in the oven too long and the face warped so much that it ruined the puppet.
This isn't Matt Damon, it's a robot that looks like Matt Damon, quick, give it a glass of chocolate milk!
Hey /u/pitchforkemporium, I'd like the Instigator Edition.
I will only be convinced by an invite to the premiere and replacing Ben Affleck as Matt's best friend.
It was two years ago and the answer was consistent about not getting it. The only difference is forgetting about the retard puppet. Something he saw on TV. This raises no alarms for me. If anything the rest of the answer is clearly consistent with the last
Fuck, I've only seen that movie once and I'm not even sure I saw all of it. I wasn't even 100% sure that the reference even *came* from that movie and I still think that whenever I see his name.
Yeah, is this actually Matt Damon? 
Good God imagine him as Red Hood vs Batfleck.
Best fucking friends fucking forever, fuck
It's not your fault.
I laugh every time.  /u/jstrydor has brought so much joy to my life. 
We're all with you
4 minutes is still enough time to hurt :'(
At least /u/Mrs_Damon has been at it for a while
I'd save you any day, Matt.
I don't think *I* know, nor do I intend to find out.
As a Maryland resident that works downtown that photo is the sole reason I will never got to a meetup.
I prefer Roland's Band.
Nowhere. Near. Berlin!
That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. That movie is phenomenal. One of my absolute favorites. Brad Pitt is crazy good in it, but Casey Affleck totally eclipses him. I'm watching this tonight. 
Yeah! I have an irrational love for it.
I always liked the guy the way I like any other solid actor, but now I love the guy. This AMA is ridiculously good. Best ever?
Hot sauces are like more obscure than craft beers. A lot of them you can only get at bbq festivals or farmer's markets or hot sauce stores. Cholula's not really obscure but it's not sriracha or frank's red hot and it makes sense to think that it's at the least a regional thing.
Ground beef isn't very authentic either. He basically described a Taco Bell Taco with lime and cholula. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
she's got hot sauce in her bag
Maslow's Hierarchy at work
He can't spell sandwich either...
Read this in the Team America voice. 
Yeah, it's not a case of the Fantastic Four where you play in the movie and already you're asking yourself "the fuck is going on?" and then you see the movie and you're like "Yep, that sucks, fuck that", so you're kind of ready to face the media.It's a case of doing the movie, having a great time, thinking the directors and producers involved are doing a magnificient job, watching the movie and being fucking proud because you truly think the movie is awesome.Then you go out there and hear that everybody is shitting on it and you're like: "Are you fucking kidding me? goddamn fucking it" 
Sorry. I feel like a jerk, but if you've only seen his movies I recommend his stand-up. He was brilliant and beautiful. I miss him.
It's a science - based dragon game, but you play it using vr! 
Like the fact that you insulted me in front of my entire crew, especially Stewart who often makes up hurtful nicknames for me, like Mr. Bumpy Landing.
> My boy's wicked smaht.ftfy
David Tyree would say otherwise.
> Matt Damon: Matt Damon!I feel like that's how a lot of these movies get started.
Girls...  You're both pretty.
Maybe their portrayal of Matt Damon as mentally deficient is more accurate than we think
You're a lunatic with the madman's dream of a milk-proof robot!
It seems reddit screwed up and didn't properly hivemind a thousand posts that just said MAATT DAAAMONN
What if its actually Ben Affleck doing an AMA as Matt Damon.
Jason Bourne in a red hood. That'll work.
so... nightwing? 
Don't fuck with me Sean, not you!
I'm glad smoke ear... *I'm glad*
I bet you're just waiting for a Brent Spiner ama
He has a hell of an average comment score, though.
That's not Matt. 
Basically, take a normal party then remove all the women, add 30-40 pounds to everyone and replace all the interesting anecdotes with recycled memes.Reddit party.
Can you link it?
Yes Howard Roland's song Fibber is just delightful. 
I was wondering how a writer had such terrible grammar but a transcriber makes a lot more sense. 
Oh man thats definitely my favorite scene from that movie "I stabbed a woman in a bar in berlin." aha 
Hey can I see your Fromers? Oh here's a fun fact...*perks up*You made out with your sister!*rekt*
It actually is a gif. That's  just some fine acting.
Son of a bitch.  Cancel the plans honey.   We are watching The Assassination..  Its way too long to type.  We are watching it though.   Great effing movie! 
Not true. Your love is completely rational. One of the most rewatchable comedies out there.
Wow. I'm over here thinking it's just as common as tobasco or tapatio. Apparently not. I do live in California though. 
Ding-Ding.  Canadian, have no idea.
Matt Daaaamon
I liked the movie.
The "drinking with a Scotsman" bit had me in tears the first time i saw it. 
It's Sky Law
Easiest kahma evah.
You should have seen the first draft of *The Martian*.Kapoor: "It's Sol 61 and we're just finding out he's still alive now?! I can only imagine what he's going through down there." CUTS TO SURFACE OF MARSWatney: "Matt Damon."
That is one of the best lines. That's a god damn Tearjerker.
Man, this mob blows
BEEEEEENNNNN AFFFFFLECKKKK
Press F to pay respects to Batfleck
"The Talented Mr. Ripley" is a great example of the type of villain Damon could play against Affleck's Batman. Make it happen!
He'd surely win an Oscar if he can pull off Batgirl
It's not your fault. 
warlizard didn't ask for it, though
That's no Moon.
Don't forget the fact that you're in room by yourself in front of your computer while everyone else in attendance is doing the same. Basically a normal night for reddit users everywhere.
YOU'RE A FIB-BER!!!!
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward... something. 
I became a little obsessed with the soundtrack for that movie after I saw it for the first time. Perfect music.
Softboiled eggs, a pinch of Mccormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning, and a bit of Cholula. Great as a post-workout snack or a quick breakfast (with a bowl of oatmeal).
Yeah I've never heard of it, lived in Indiana and now Virginia.
Matt. Damon.
*Some* kids are already afraid of puppets, JLSaun. Do you really want to make them ALL afraid of puppets?Wait, are kids afraid of puppets? Am I thinking of clowns again?
now go instigate!
Exactly the role I thought of too.
don't forget about casey!
*cue crying into shoulder*
If /u/warlizard didn't want attention, he wouldn't have made that sick gaming forum.
That's a.. That's a wink
it was painful upvoting that comment, but funny because it's true
Harrison ford
Have you googled it yet? I didn't recognize it by name, but as soon as I saw a picture of the bottle there was an immediate "oh, that one" recognition.
Matt... Damon.
I'm 29 and afraid of both.  
I've already instigated enough for one day. 
Why not? Everyone else does.
Did Bobcat Goldthwait and Gilbert Gottfried also go to that school?
Maybe call the amberlamps just to be sure.
You just said that to make me scroll back up and look at that picture again didn't you. I have inspected all of the boobies now at least three times... what am I doing with my life...
"LOOK AT THE MATT DAMON PICTURES HE MADE ME!"  "That costs five bucks?"  "Well, no, it was free, but I want to give it to him anyway."  "Why?"  "IT'S A NICE GESTURE."
"If I drink enough, I won't think enough"
These features are on steep slopes, so our present rovers would not be able to climb up to them. Because liquid water appears to be present, these regions are considered special regions where we have to take extra precautions to prevent contamination by earth life. Our current rovers have not been sterilized to the degree needed to go to an area where liquid water may be present. -RZ
We think this is a very small amount of water -- maybe just enough to wet the top layer of the surface of Mars. The streaks are ~4-5 meters wide and ~200-300 meters long. -- LT
The next step is to look for more locations where brine flows may occur. We have covered 3% of Mars at resolutions high enough to see these features. -RZ
Presently, NASA is looking into the possibility of sending humans to the vicinity of Mars in the early 2030s. In this scenario, the earliest humans to the surface would be in the late 2030s. -RZ
Tap water leaking. -RZ
Think of this as a "seep" not a flow. We have not seen flowing water on the surface. We see something that darkens the soil, which may be just a wetting action but still involves (briny) liquid. -RZ
The Curiosity rover does not have life detection instruments. It would look for confirmation that liquid water was present and how long during the day it was liquid. -RZ
It's possible. We know of forms of life that hibernate during dry seasons on Earth. The water that we're seeing within the RSL (the seasonal dark streaks that we're seeing on slopes on Mars) is salty. Salty water could be harmful to life.We don't know what Earth life could do to any potential life on other worlds. That's why we try to clean our spacecraft very carefully. -- LT
New impact craters on Mars sometimes have bright ice exposed in the bottom of the crater. This goes away over a few months. The ice, when exposed, is going from solid to vapor. Evaporation of a briny flow will also occur, so the water needs to be resupplied. We don't know how. -RZ
Information flows to the public very quickly. If one of our missions here at JPL detected life, we'd notify NASA headquarters immediately, who would then follow procedures to notify the US government and the public. -- SLS
There are no confirmed brine flows (RSL) near Curiosity nor Opportunity. There are in Gale Crater some interesting slope streaks but they are several km away from the Curiosity's present path. -RZ
Militarise NASA.
We don't know where the water in these hydrated salts come from.  That is the next mystery to solve!   They leading hypotheses are that (1) the salts are sucking up the water from the atmosphere, but you are correct, there isn't much water in the atmosphere, and (2) that the water is coming from the subsurface.  There is certainly more to learn!  --LT
The ice caps freeze and sublime (solid to vapor.) The RSL water stays liquid because it has salts in it. Yes, we know there's water on Mars. We're looking for where it stays liquid for an extended period of time. -RZ
Send Matt Damon. He already knows the terrain.
MRO has been taking data at Mars since March 2006, nearly 10 years.  The HIRISE instrument (high-resolution imager) has currently taken images of only about 2.4% of the surface.  --LT
We think liquid water is essential for life (at least as we know it.) That does not mean that life is there; but, it's a good place to look. -RZ
There is a hydrologic cycle on Mars, but typically it involves vapor going to ice (frost) or ice going to vapor. There is no rain in Mars today, but there may have been very early in its history. -RZ
Just, like, throw them real hard.
"That's weird. Hey guys..." 
The salts in the water appear to be perchlorates, so I wouldn't want to drink the water. To be a future resource for humans, you would want to remove the salts. -RZ
this was an insanely cool question to ask!
It would be salty, but considering that perchlorate is toxic to humans,  you wouldn't want to drink it. -- SLS
Water in some form has probably been on Mars since at least 3.9 Bya. --LT
This is super exciting!  It is an important discovery because it is evidence that supports our hypothesis that the RSL (seasonal dark streaks that appear to flow in the warm season) are flowing briny (salty) water.  --LT
We have a policy for Planetary Protection.  This policy means that we clean our spacecraft of earth microbes to varying degrees depending on where the spacecraft is being sent.  It the intended location is thought to have a high possibility of harboring microbes, then we go to the maximum extent to clean the spacecraft. --LT
They were waiting for the release of the movie "The Martian" to maximize interest.
The features that darken and fade as temperatures get warmer and then colder are long but narrow. The difficulty was to get enough resolution from our orbiter instruments to first detect, and then characterize what these features are. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) can do that with its HiRISE camera and CRISM Mineral Mapper. -RZ
Mars had liquid water on its surface billions of years ago. Where that water went is the subject of our current investigations. Was it lost to space? Or is it frozen in the crust today? Mars seems to have ice ages when water at the poles is sublimated and redistributed to the rest of the planet. Ice in the crust today may have been formed during one of those ice age cycles. -RZ
No.  The 2016 NASA Mars mission, InSight, will put a seismometer on Mars to measure Mars-quakes.  --LT
Liquid water, even if very salty, is still a good place to look for life forms. We don't know how robust martian life (if it exists) could be. Also, water in any form is a resource that future missions could exploit. -RZ
MRO has been in orbit for 10 years and has mapped ~2.4 percent of Mars in high-res. We have six-meter-per-pixel imagery of more than 90 percent of the surface. -- LT
Not quite rainbows, because there is no rain, but we have seen icebows with the Pathfinder mission. -- RZ
>Has Nestle tried to steal the water yet?FTFY
If the atmospheric pressure on Mars was the same as on Earth, then conditions are warm enough that water could be liquid on many places. The atmospheric pressure may have been greater in the past when the Mars channels were formed. -RZ
The signature that was seen by the MRO CRISM experiment was hydrated perchlorates.   This means that water (H2O) was involved. --LT
The RSL are a surprise because they appear to flow seasonally and the best hypothesis is due to liquid, briny water.  Mars can get barely above freezing for short periods above time.  The RSL are not though to be due to glaciers because where they are seen (equatorial and mid-latitude regions) we do not see glaciers.  --LT
If you pour pure water on the surface (depending on the time of day) it will either freeze or boil away into the atmosphere. The salts that were talked about in the press release today would keep the water liquid at much lower temperatures. Remember that the temperatures on Mars change by more than 100 degrees Celsius every day. -RZ
Yes, there is hardly any California on Mars.
Discovering the RSL (seasonal dark slope streaks) took having an orbiter (MRO) observing over multiple Mars years.  Then, we had to form the hypothesis, and then go test it, by taking observations with the CRISM spectrometer.  The features are small (4-5 m in width, and 200-300 m length) and only when there are many RSL together can it fill enough of the CRISM pixel to get the signal.  --LT
At the North pole there is a polar tap made of water ice, which is a mile thick and several hundred km across. Todays story was focused on liquid (briny) water closer to the equator. -RZ
What is involved in sterilizing a rover to that degree? I'm sure the current rovers were sterilized a great deal already, so what else would need to be done to future rovers, and is that level of sterilization feasible now or in the near future?
Wouldn't radiation have killed them by now?
Doesn't that suggest that there could be wells with much, much more water underneath the surface?
>3% at high resolutionsTHAT LEAVES SO MUCH MORE ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES, YAY! 
How much extra funding would NASA require before this date could be moved forwards? Or is it in terms of actual technology needing to be developed?
"Damnit, Xarnax! I told you to shut the faucet off, now the human know we were there!"
Silly media. They're using the phrase "flowing water" all over the place.
"Phew"-The Martians
Wasn't the base of life on Earth micro-small lifeforms in salt water though?Disclaimer: Genuinely curious, I know nothing.
I'm so amazed that a fourth grade class just communicated with actual NASA scientists. 
THIS is the most exciting part to me.  
By "US government", do you mean to include the US Planetary Defense Force?
Should... should we alter its path?
I, for one, volunteer to be a space Marine.
When it sublimates, is it essentially "gone" forever?  Or does it hang around in the atmosphere to eventually re-freeze at some point?
Yeah, but there was that time we sent him to another solar system. I'm surprised they sent him to Mars after that.
416 more years to go! 
Wow this is the first time today I've seen this joke. 
> There is no rain in Mars today, but there may have been very early in its history.The thought of the *last rain storm on Mars* puts me in a state that's hard to describe.
>*GO LONG*
There's a quote (unconfirmed, apparently) from Isaac Asimov about this.>The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!', but 'That's funny ...'
We should dip it in ebola
The idea is that the yogurt bacteria takes over everything, pushing out all competitors. Then when there is only Yogurt, it all dies in space since we know that specific bacteria can't survive in space
And add electrolytes. 
The salts detected on Mars are magnesium or sodium perchlorate. These are not typical salts on the Earth, but they have the attribute that they can keep water liquid to much colder temperatures which occur on Mars. -RZ
Bya = Billions of years ago for all curious. I had to google it :/
1-10 tho...
Why not *always* clean them to the maximum extent just in case? Too expensive? Takes too much time?
But the nontechnical tho....
Is the 6 meters/pixel data public? If not, will it be?I think it would be cool to create a Mars vizualisation app.
Pics or didn't happen 
It's not stealing, 26$ were paid in dues for all Mars water. The trademark Spacewater has been registered and extraction begins whenever enough public money will have been spent go make private profits attractive to their board.Do you even capitalism?
At any moment.
Hahahaha..Seriously though We need water. It's starting to look like the world from mad max out here.
What's with the different units, NASA?
It's the thing that bothered me most when watching Armageddon. No fucking Earthquakes on an asteroid.
Proper sterilization would involve very high heat and pressure, autoclaving it (hard to design a rover to withstand that heat, but not impossible), not just a rub down with rubbing alcohol
The rovers have been sterilized for their particular landing sites where there's been no evidence of present day liquid water. To go to the RSL rovers will be required to be sterilized to a higher level. We also take samples of microbes that might be on the spacecraft before they're launched, so we can compare with any future discoveries. -RZ
It'd be pretty embarrassing for NASA to say "THERE IS LIFE ON MARS" then later say "sorry that was just some waterbears stuck in the gears from earth"
It's both. The dark streaks are on slopes that are too steep for our present rovers. Also, we want to be careful to not introduce Earth bugs into an environment that may have liquid water. -RZ
Or given them super powers?
They wouldn't be "wells", they would be aquifers (subsurface, water-saturated rock), although theoretically you could drill wells into such an aquifer, I suppose.
Considering a flat surface, you could calculate the depth of the water based on the viscosity of the water, if you knew it's salinity.  The gravitational pull of Mars would apply a certain level of force upon the water, and, based on the viscosity of that water, you could then calculate how compressed (deep) the water would be on a flat surface, if that surface is non-absorbing.Similar to measuring the "depth" of a drop of water on Earth, which holds it's shape and size based on similar properties, of Earth. 
Wow..please check your low res privilege at the door. We are still on earth 
Some people have claimed we are more technological prepared to send people to Mars, than they were to send people to the Moon in the 60s. I just don't think most people are willing to spend as much on NASA as we did back then.

I am not a scientist, but I imagine there's a sweet spot for it all.
When I was in elementary school our teacher gave us an assignment to write to scientists anywhere in the US and ask them questions.  We *all* got responses from our chosen scientists.  No joke, every single one of us.  I kept my penpal at the University of Colorado Boulder who worked in an observatory.  We'd talk about space and stuff.  Kept that up for a couple months.It just takes a teacher to open that door.
Would this not imply its being resupplied by underground sources?
Most scientists say ''we don't know how''. That's why they're scientists in the first place. It's not a rare occurance.
he means DOOP
we were like "yo what if there was life out there"and Steve was like "well, i guess we'll tell ppl"
No, or else we risk contaminating the water with microbes from Earth
You're not going to do it with that name, /u/on_the_ground 
You would need to find oil there. With water found, you will only get California on board :)
It re-freezes back out. The ice caps grow and shrink seasonally.
I would like to submit my application now to start training for the next 15 years so I can explore mars for the good of humanity.

Interesting stuff, thanks!
Judging by the reply, looks like a 3 to me.
I read today that they have to bake it to a certain temperature to ensure they get all of it. Not all components can handle this amount of heat so the rover would have to be designed from the get-go to be a 'heat tolerant' design.

Seems to me that as soon as you take it out of the autoclave it will get contaminated again. 
That's a really fucking smart idea. You guys must be, like, rocket scientists or something. 
This actually happened with microbes on the Moon.
Yes because humanity would never even consider to fuck up the locals in order to colonize. 
To be fair we aren't part of the life forms governed by the prime directive because we haven't yet achieved warp technology.

Well, you require a shit ton of vespene gas,  don't get me started on the minerals.
Yeah good luck with that, I heard that Disney guy is a real stiff.
That depends on how pregnant they are to begin with.
Basically we'd need China or somebody to be heading to Mars, then we'll speed it up so we can get there first. 
I'm fairly certain (about 100 percent) that NASA won't send people to space knowing they won't come back.

I DRINK YOUR **MILKSHAKE!** I DRINK IT UP! 
Good non-scientist answer. 
I think that most scientists are excited about the prospect of getting new blood and want to facilitate genuine interest in the young. They have the hindsight and foresight to see that they built their work off of their predecessors, and while they might not discover an inhabitable planet during their own careers, their work will live on in future generations of scientists.
Yes. It also implies an underground alien base.
Isn't " we don't know" the basis for just about every scientific experiment?

#Space Ebola?! Fuck that
It's Brine-dow! 
Bit beside the point here, but you can supercool your beers (or wines, or pop) without a freezer quickly by putting the containers in water with ice cubes and adding salt. The salt will make the ice melt much faster as it would under normal circumstances and will superchill the water. The water will not freeze because of the salt but will be at lower temps then usual. This trick will cool your beverages in about 5-10 mins.So, yes, you can chill you beers faster in brine. Just wipe the container of the brine before pouring/drinking.
I'd give it a hard 4.5
It's been over an hour, NASA must be dead.
Nah, that's when a pro bodybuilder walks into the room.
Put the autoclave in an autoclave.
If only there was a place somewhere between earth and mars with plenty of radiation and no air to reinfect things.
Not necessarily, there is life on earth that can survive the vacuum of space, such as extremophilic bacteria and some micro-invertebrates.
Sounds like my university's rover team.
All jokes aside, the precautions they took is fucking brilliant. I'm from the US an travelled to Bahrain recently an I didn't even plan ahead enough to realize I needed to bring an adaptor to allow myself to plug in my electronics.
Wait. What? Is there life on the moon?
I'd like to think we're a little more aware of what we're doing now.
I mean, we've had the warp tool in photoshop for like a decade now... can that count?

I don't want to put words in that other poster's mouth, but when they mention sacrifice life I think it may be a commentary on the idea that the "failure is not an option" mindset may have held us back terribly.Risk is part of the business, and as long as a single Senator can stop everything in its tracks by saying "is there ANY chance someone might die?", We cannot venture back to the moon or onwards to Mars.Our current culture is not just risk-averse, it seems almost pathologically risk phobic for space travel .

Home Alone 17:Lost in Space
>kindeegahtnehFTFY
Correct. In my own opinion (based more on hunch than anything) there's probably still some very basic microorganisms alive on Mars. I would personally be surprised for us to find absolutely *no* life on Mars past or present now than for NASA to reveal we found bacteria (or something resembling bacteria). But that is 100% just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt (heh). 
I imagine a lot of scientists have a moment like that when they are little. And it felt wondrous, and they have genuine altruism in the support of that feelings propagation.Like if I had ever gotten my shit together, star watching with my grandfather would have been the thing that made me a scientist. There's an emotional element to this that ties into why they became what they are.Probably not true of scientists exclusively.

Deputy Director, how did an Englishman come to work for the CIA and is it a good idea? And why haven't the other agents commented on the fact that you are English? Maybe they haven't noticed, in which case they're not smart enough to work for the CIA. 
You should ask my son Daniel that question. He is a dedicated fan. But, there was a time in the era of Jones, Hunter, Sprake and Lorrimer when I thought they were the best team in Europe. 
Easy. First season of Blunt Talk. For the 12 weeks of shooting, I remember nothing except laughing, which is a nice way to get through a working day, especially if it's 14 hours. Everyone in our cast is a comedian (or comedienne). They're funny on screen and they're funny off, which accounts for my comment about laughing. There's not much laughter when you're performing King Lear or Macbeth. 
You're a lucky man to be playing Henry V. I played it in Manchester, England in 1963. How many of you saw it? If you're transitioning from film to stage, there's only one piece of advice: find a great voice coach. 
I'm sorry to say that you missed only one of the two occasions I have appeared on stage with Dame Judi. The other one was the farewell to the old auditorium in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre by dozens of actors, who had made that stage their home. This time, next year, Ian McKellen and I will be in rehearsals in London for Harold Pinter's great play, No Man's Land. 
A martini with Old Raj gin and very important, one olive. Who knew that you must never put an even number of olives in a martini glass. My son told me that martini drinkers are superstitious about even numbers of olives. 
My father retired from the military as Regimental Sergeant Major of the British Parachute Regiment. He jumped into action three times. I don't care for the action part of it, but I would love to experience what he did of jumping and parachuting safely to the ground. 
Great costumes in every film, but I loved my superhero costume and my flying chair in Days of Future Past. The chair actually levitated, but only a few inches. 
I'm sure it would be if he were there. He never is as I've always recorded in isolation. Maybe before the series wraps up, Stan and Avery could have a long cozy chat over a glass of malt whiskey. 
I wish, but my experience of working with Adrian Scarborough, who plays my valet Harry in Blunt Talk, has spoiled me for anyone else no matter how good a job they might do. Adrian Scarborough is brilliant in Blunt Talk. 
It's too late, he's already seen everything.
I, too, would LOVE to see Sir Patrick guest on Tabletop. There are plenty of Shakespeare-themed card/board games out there...
There will be too... At some point in the distant future, if/when we unlock warp travel (and it's theoretically possible), the first ship, **must** be called enterprise, it would be a crime against humanity not to. 
I'd settle for Locutus of Borg.
Aw, I wish he had answered this one.

Exactly, he's already worth $110 million. Do what you love.
Glad I've inspired someone else. Let's inform the world and raise the demand and maybe it will happen!!
Amateur mistake. 
He did "The Last Battle" from The Chronicles of Narnia. Great work, and even gets into doing weird voices for different characters.
Always a Clydesdale, never a Clyde, eh Bojack? 
No, he's the one smart enough to wish for more genies.
Also a Brummie and Yorkshire tea is the absolute bee's knees.All other tea bags aren't as good.
I did too, but am much happier with his answer, as I'm going to go buy some tea. 
Twinings is for porcelain cups and raised pinkies. If you poured Yorkshire Tea into a porcelain cup it would explode and shower your affronted guests in piping hot, delicious char. ONLY A MUG WILL DO
He means an additional bag as one isn't a strong enough flavour. Yorkshire Gold is strong tea.
>Where's your wife this evening? > Handcuffed to a radiator in Fallujah. 
His love of prostitutes and his ability to make them dissappear is only matched by Ben Affleck.
I was really glad to see they drew the character to look just as he does in real life.  Going from his serious stuff to this, it just makes it even funnier for some reason.
A true Englishman!
It's not rare over here in Britain, but it is slightly uncommon. It really needs the addition of cheese to be perfect though.
If sir Patrick Stewart asks if your name is sunny you say *yes*!
"So it's a comedy?"
I'm also in the UK and can't watch it, apparently this country has no respect for this country!
The BBC isn't allowed to make any money by selling its products to the British public. BBC worldwide has adverts on it and therefore British audiences aren't allowed to see it in case this becomes a loophole for making money by the BBC. 
But it did win a Hugo.
Pretty sure it was sold at a charity auction. 
The Measure of a Man is one of the best examples of what made TNG great Trek and great science fiction, and why Picard was the best Captain. The Inner Light epitomizes what made TNG great television period, and how amazing an actor /u/sirpatstew is.
Tough crowd... They're booing *Shakespeare!*
Is this the black friars playhouse in Staunton VA? 
Willamette Dammit! 
*Cellar Temperature
Shhhh not so loud!! People might try and move here...
from a previous AMA he has stated he actually dislikes Earl Grey. 
Lily was the voice of reason. I believe that they wanted to get Whoopi as Guinan back but couldn't do it for some reason. Alfre Woodard was excellent in the role, though, playing the fish-out-of-water (or rather, in unfamiliar technological waters) to a T, interpreting her situation and surroundings in a way she could understand. Great new role; sad that due to the nature of the story she was not brought up again.
From other threads with actors in the past, it's a logistics issue usually.  People are busy with a large number of things and there isn't always time to get together with the entire voice acting cast and run through the episode at the same time.  Throw in the fact that the voice actors don't always live in the same time zone and/or country and it makes it a bit tougher.
TIL Star Trek was like mister Rogers for adults...*in space!*
Because he's explicitly an actor.
*laughtrack*
The character's been around for almost 30 years with a ton of episodes and story arcs centered around him.  I'm not sure how much more they *can* develop him.
Fun fact in the french version the machine spoke in German
The real reason is the +1 to naval movement and sight I expect
Actually they let everyone who carries it keep the torch. I've got one at home.
/r/highqualitygifs
Sir Patrick, technically.
Dorothy Mantooth is a SAINT!
Smooth move, Ferguson.
I know, I know but I am uncompromising.
The line must be drawn HERE and NO further!
Now I need to reevaluate my life...thanks
I read your comment in his voice. And mine. 
That makes perfect sense!
I also am having a hard time believing he couldn't get back to making movies if he ever chose so after, he has proven his worth ten times over and the entire world has seen him do it. 
For normals. For Sir Pat? It's barely getting started.
Now I need to see a muppet version of TNG before I die. Thanks Boofpatrol.
The dwarves are for the dwarves!
> ONLY A MUG WILL DOAnd a Sports Direct mug at that.
"She wanted to come, but I do NOT negotiate with terrorists. Hey! Do I smell meat-loaf?"
Holy shit how did I not recognize that? 
"Smith, a thought occurred to me last night as I was staring at the back of your daughters head..."
The run with Coco, the fat Asian, what one of the funniest things. Then the cocaine bender with the random prostitute where they were shooting up his home. Oh my god yes.
"I had to take a detour with Hailey once, hehe, got lost in the bush and had to take a dirt road home..what are we pulling over for?""We're gonna fight in this field."
I'm giggling with hearing Patrick Stewart's voice saying "Yummy"
Yes, that would be a different version of the apple sandwich, but it would have to be the strongest, grittiest, and sharpest cheddar. 
That sounds more like a dessert than a sandwich....
Like it's been some kind of parent trap situation the whole time? So at some MI6/ CIA meeting (or summer camp) Bullock (as some high rank at MI6) realises there's this american who looks just like him and they agree to trade places. They think it'll be really funny but no one has noticed so they've just been kinda keeping at it.
Damned British people - they ruined Britain!
I'm pretty sure half the stuff they show on worldwide has license fee money in it somewhere, if this is the reason then it's bullshit.
Good. That makes me feel better, actually.
I say this as a really *really* big fan of TNG. Start at season 3 and only go back to watch the first two seasons after you've finished seasons 3-7 and are desperate for more.
For $40,000, and there's an interview with Sir Patrick giggling about it ("it doesn't play; it's not a real flute").
Yeah, I remember that auction and reading the flute was "estimated" to sell for $300.  Right then and there I said "yeah, they're off by an order of magnitude on that estimate".It sold for $40,000.  So TWO orders of magnitude, and then some.
Yes, it is!Have you been?
Willamette Pinot is among the best in the world, I can't get it on my side of the world (Russia) but when I am home I made sure to enjoy a few bottles
Shit....sorry. Crater Lake is horrible and the coast is ugly. There, that should do it.
Most Englishman do..
Captain Picard was french so I guess this checks out.
What is this noise? I protest! I am not a merry man! 
Yeah all of his arcs and personal adventures really have concluded. He made up with his son, his parents got to see him grow up and be a success, humankind accepts him, klingons accept him. He has had his own ship, was briefly the chancellor of the high council, was the human-klingon ambassador. He has returned honor to his father's name. Even was briefly married. Like what else do you want to explore, Mr Dorn?
No, that's just the best boon of being British by birth.
I hope you got into spelunking as an excuse to use it all the time. 
Factually, even. Knights are called by their first name. 
I'm pretty sure he's implying that he would love theater so much that he wouldn't want to do film again. Not that he wouldn't be able to get film roles anymore.
And it was only named the Enterprise because Trekkies flooded NASA with so many votes that they couldn't be ignored.
Correct. He's got the party in the back, but we're missing the business in the front.
If you're like me and haven't seen episodes that old in a while, only when you were younger, you didn't quite think to put a name to voice actors, or realize they were doing multiple voices for a show.Nowadays I can almost always tell which actor/actress is voicing a character. FXX played the Stonecutters episode a few months back and upon watching it for the first time in probably 15 years I was all, "Holy shit, that's Patrick Stewart!"
"Smith! Come on in, we're doing *cocaine* and shooting *guns*!"
Get a nice cheddar as well: if it doesn't work for you then add a few slices of the cheese in there as well. If you don't like that then I'm afraid you're beyond hope. 
Said like a true Yorkshireman.
Yeah, well up North they have all kind of strange and wonderful things.
Indeed, most BBC programmes have been produced for the domestic British audience with licence fee money, but they are shown to the British public without adverts. The British public are seen to have already paid for the service and if they were to be exposed to adverts they would effectively be paying again, for something they already bought. 
It was only the third TV episode to win a Hugo.  The first two were both from TOS.
Funny you say that because I grew up on TNG and recently just started watching it again on netflix, started on season 3.1-2 aren't bad but they were still perfecting the formula that hit the sweet spot so perfectly in the following seasons.
But he did really learn to play the tin whistle in preparation for the episode.
Though, to be fair, they only filmed it at something like 30-40MPH, not the full speed you might expect if you assumed the director is just insane.
Or renegade archaeology!
I recently saw Horns (which is a pretty weird but kind of awesome movie), and it actually surprised me how I didn't think of him as Harry at all. The American accent might've helped.
Gurney Halleck does not fuck around. It's all business.
Patrick is in everything. He was even Bambi's dad.
Bullock: This control room is able to calibrate force fields so strong that the holographic images projected onto them feel real to the touch.Dick: Oh, so it works like the holodeck?Bullock: The what now?Stan: From Star Trek.Bullock: Some of us spent the late 80s and early 90s getting laid, Smith.
So the answer is not to let them see it AT ALL if it's no longer on iplayer even though my money helped create the damn thing! What a world.
Except for when he's in the mood for loveplay.
Everythings coming up wankertea...
To be clear, I am American, and I still do not know who Pat Sharp actually is.  I was simply randomly searching for great mullets on Google Images and found it.  Turned out to work out perfectly with the English theme.
YES! I'll be there. Can't wait.
Slowly. Sorry about that. 
Don't worry we can wait a little bit :)
I'm gonna throw out a guess and say fridge nuke from Crystal Skull. It just seems so perfect.
We aren't in any of KG&T's show. I really hope they're successful as all getout. Can't wait to watch it.
I love live shows. I love touring and I love interacting with a live audience. There's stuff that happens in a room with people around that is genuinely electric. Jamie was done touring at the end of 2015, and Michael Stevens and I were mutual fans and started discussing it and it seemed like a natural. Magician Michael Weber, an incredible magic designer and writer is our director. 
Alton is the best. He's hilarious. He's just as funny as you want and a bit darker. 
Simone Gertz!!
Great question! Everyone should have a multi tool. Everyone should have something akin to the iFixit bit kit (to be able to take apart anything). Tools that are shit until you spend $:Air powered rivet gun. Don't waste your time on the $30.00 one. Spot Welder. Nippers: go ahead and invest in a set of Knipex nippers, the last pair you'll ever need.
That's THE question! The best way is to show them obsessive builds by others. Wake that part of the brain up that says "I've always wanted X, maybe I could make it MYSELF!". Also- sharing the build log/methods goes a long way to helping people understand that it's not beyond them to problem-solve.

Favorite burger is a Jardiniere in San Francisco (the owner, Traci Des Jardins is a friend so clear conflict of interest on my part) and lately she's been serving the Impossible Burger (all plant proteins!) which is INSANELY DELICIOUS. Serious. They serve it at the bar. Go try one.
Yes. Sigh. Reddit, like the web in general, is a mix of the high and low, the good and bad. When it's bad it feels like middle school at it's worst. I think the general tone of discourse on the reddit that I see is getting better rather than worse. That keeps me coming. I also spent lots of time on Metafilter as a salve to reddit's baser instincts. Seriously who makes fun of a 13 year old girl? Remember being 13? It sucked ass for all of us. Why make it worse?

Love working with Michael. He talks just like he does in the videos, so that when he's handing you a coffee or talking over lunch, you half expect to do a VERY DEEP DIVE into what it's all about. I love the collaboration.
Spirited Away. Holy shit I love that movie. 
It's a battle between present me and future me. Present me would like to go home without sweeping up. Future me knows that he'll thank past me for cleaning up and leaving the shop ready for the next morning. It's an ongoing conversation. I also LOVE organizing. I spend at least an hour a day doing it. even in my house if not in my shop. 
IIRC They've had to cancel a myth about homemade explosives because it was **too** potent. And I think they ended up alerting the FBI who may have already known.

Good design is always about communication. It's about telling the right story at the right time. When you head towards a door and you can't tell immediately whether to push or pull it, that's BAD design. That's something that the wonderful book The Design of Everyday Things taught me. I agree with you. I learned graphic design just before computers and have noted that the same rules still apply even though the medium and methods of execution have radically changed.
We don't have to be partisan to understand that we OWN the things we buy and should be able to modify them. Promote that idea. Live that idea. Improve your toys and share what you've done.

"Saint Barbara is often portrayed with miniature chains and a tower. As one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, Barbara continues to be a popular saint in modern times, perhaps best known as the patron saint of armourers, artillerymen, military engineers, miners and others who work with explosives because of her old legend's association with lightning, and also of mathematicians."From her Wikipedia entry. I only happen to know this because I live in Santa Barbara, CA, and one day I decided to look up our namesake.

Hope that incident didn't hurt her too bad.
Good thing it had that extra pound or it wouldn't have been impressive.
hidden in there is an interesting question though: what kinds of careers are there out there in effects/explosives/etc. or for tinkerers that don't necessarily lean on formal higher education? how does one go from being a hobbyist in something like effects or design to having a career?
And by in touch we mean a full body cavity search.
Those are the best places. It all depends on how you want to go about it. Missouri, MS&T, is more focused on mining and how to use bulk explosives with focus on theory of rock blast. They also work closely on production. New Mexico Tech, NMT, is much closer to being a scientist/ research engineer with new materials, ideas, or methodologies, and testing it in an academic style in a field setting. Honestly many of the national labs and similar groups love NMT graduates for explosives RnD work. Its how I got my job and am working with 4 other graduates :P

They were able to do so much because they centralized their space agency. It wasn't like NASA where different parts were put together from different facilities and transported via train.

The Soviets *really* knew how to lower costs.

Don't get scared, but it's time for me to leave. Thank you, everyone, for the great questions. I hope you enjoy the Hunting Hour marathon on Discovery Family Channel. And I hope you have a scary Halloween. Bye for now.
I was really happy with the GB Movie. I'm so glad they're talking about doing a sequel.
God, that's probably Jontrons greatest video to date. Memorable quotes from the video "FBI should be knocking this door down any minute""CANT A GUY GET SOME *PRIVACY*?? HMM HMM HM HM HMM"Larry- I had to check to see if there was hair growing anywhere elseJon- No no no, no no Larry- none on my chestJon- please LarryLarry- None on my backJon- you don't know what you're doing Larry- and now... Jon- STOP 
My latest adult horror novel is titled RED RAIN.
I love the R.L. Grime mixes. Of course I listen to them.
I read mostly comics--Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, MAD. When I was nine, I discovered Ray Bradbury. Changed my life.
I'd vote for all four.
All of my stories start with a title. The title leads me to the story.
My favorite GB book is he Haunted Mask. I also enjoy writing the Slappy books-- he's so evil, he's fun to write.
The Shining.
I'm a big Stephen King fan. I think he's a terrific storyteller. I also like Peter Straub.
Yes, terribly wrong. You need help.
I was very happy with the movie. I think it could have been a TINY bit scarier. But I truly loved the way it came out.
They use the order RSTLNE though
This was my favorite part of Goosebumps!  I would tag the decision page and then go down one path, and then go back to the decision and do the other! Seriously, R. L. Stine made reading so much fun. Between him and J.K. Rowling, I became a lifetime reader.
Working with the puppeteers was the most fun a writer could have. Did you know that I modeled Batly the Bat after my son Matt?
The words Monster Blood just popped into my head. Then I had to figure out what it was.
I'm working on a new GB series for next year. It's called Goosebumps SlappyWorld. The first book is called Slappy Birthday to You.
Jellyjam from Camp Jellyjam. He smelled so bad, he died of his own odor.
Some things are too dark and depressing for horror writers.
I don't get much sleep at Halloween time. I'm out publicizing my Discovery Family Channel marathon that starts in a few hours. And my newest GB book, The Lizard of Oz.
I'm very loyal to the KitKat Bar.
Searched your name. First book result. "Gay T-Rex Law Firm". Ok. Edit - Next result. "Space Raptor Butt Invasion"
Stephen King, Agatha Christie, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Coben, P.G. Wodehouse....
None planned at this time. Sorry.
Rod Serling was a hero of mine. The Twilight Zone was a big influence on me. I've seen them all.
I always wish I had done something differently, but I seldom look back at books. Gotta move on to the next one.By the way, the new Fear Street book is called The Dead Boyfriend. I'm enjoying writing Fear Street again. And watch for a Fear Street movie next year!
No such thing. 
I don't miss the series because they're still being shown. Discovery Family Channel will be showing The Haunting Hour all of November.
No. Has anyone ever met her??
I'm scared you might miss The Haunting Hour marathon that starts in two hours on Discovery Family Channel. Seven straight hours of R.L. Stine shows. Hope you don't miss it.
These are the real questions right here.I will never forget how blown away I was hearing "*listeners* beware, you choose the scare!" on the 2013 mix.
The cycle of abuse continues.
Me too!  I remember feeling like I was so grown up when I started reading this series.
You're adorable and I hope you get to meet R.L. Stine one day!
Why are you asking this? Do you have a thing about mustard?
He accused me of using up all of the amusement park plots in the world.
The only message in my books is RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
St. Croix. We go there every Christmas.
Not close at all. He played me as Orson Welles! Hilarious.
Welcome to Dead House. It would fit the zombie craze today.
How to write a book. Step 1. Write all the chaptersStep 2.
A choice with only one answer, or so my childhood self seemed to think.Thank you for all those nights spent reading late under the covers with a flashlight!
When you are, please let us on /r/Marvel know!  I would be excited for that!
I'm not afraid of the dark. It's what's in the dark that you have to watch out for. Like creepies, and crawlies, and clowns, and bus drivers, and my step dad, and lake monsters.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Awesome, glad to hear!
FBI Warning:"You sick fuck"This program has been canceled indefinitely
Childhood me would be thrilled that R.L. Stine just answered my silly question.Adult me is just as thrilled.Thank you!
November 22nd!
RL Stine gets turnt
Be careful with it it's hot 
Were you ever influenced by something he may have painted before you were finished writing?
Hopefully not. Plus we've got a Give Yourself Goosebumps planned as well, where we'll read every single page and upload the pages individually so that you can literally choose pages on YouTube. And we'll be taking shots for every ending we hit...
Ever read The Illustrated Man? My high school library had a tiny copy of this, hardbound, with the best illustrations of the guy's tattoos.
They're all dead, no need to worry about hurting their feelings.
I love this answer. It's so counter-intuitive but it sounds like a great way to have fun with your writing and challenge yourself to keep going a step further.Also, probably a good marketing decision. What book title would draw you in? Let's write a story about it.
In the fourth grade I was told by my after-school program to go to the media room and pick out a VHS tape for everyone to watch. I went in, looked through all of the Sesame Street, Veggie Tales, Princess movie horribleness and chose The Haunted Mask 1. I took it back and was admonished by my teacher for picking a movie that was too scary to watch. Just know that you were my source of inspiration when I wrote "Ms. Stevenson is a wuss" on the inside of one of the classroom cubbies later on. 
But you didn't answer the second question.
You traumatized me as a kid and I want more.
Well, I tried. 
Yes but you forget the obvious:  brains are fucky, yo.
 but did his parents get the name from WOF
>I would tag the decision page and then go down one path, and then go back to the decision and do the other!But...but that's *cheating!*
Like a game, but on video!
Do you refer to him as Mattly the Mat?
are we gonna talk about how he didn't answer either question
Oh man, I can smell it. I am 29 years old, prob read it 19 years ago, that stinky dude will forever be ingrained in my head. 
This seems so bizarre to me because I'm so used to reading in the back of the goosebumps/fear street books, "R.L. Stine lives with his wife and 14 year old son Matt." 
I knew we'd get along.. 
All scary stories to tingle your butt and get hard with your buds
These questions are HARD AS ROCKS in a normal way
What do you think of Black Mirror?
That's great! In all honesty the fear street books where my absolute favorite. Oh man now I'm going to have to read them again.
"A dream is what you want to do but still haven't pursued, [He] knew what [he] wanted and did it 'til it was done - [He's] been the dream that [he] wanted to be since day 1."
My favorite part of this answer is the implication that he already knew the meme before the question was asked.
hmmmm..... 300 books.... maybe u could teach a certain author how to write a book a bit quicker.
I think he's using our vulnerable childhoods to advertise, guys.
Good, good. It's important for kids to learn disappointment early - to break what's left of their spirit, you see. 
My childhood nightmare relived why!!!!
I personally love mustard. I have at least 5 different types of mustard in my fridge at any time.

For some people outlines are like the blueprints of a building (general ideas, this goes here and that goes there, etc.) For others the outline's the actual structural beams of the building (entire sentences or even scenes written into the outline, minute details of the story, etc.) 
I had a Goosebumps clip on book light that was well used in these scenarios
Thanks for letting me know this sub is a thing!
Now the ghost of comics future will come to haunt him
What if there's a blank canvas?Where do I even start?Is it worth the risk? Should I go back to law school?
Bob actually had a cameo in that movie as Mr. Black the drama teacher.  
Maybe = yes
"Oh Larry your just a fucking asshole you know that?"
Aaron, do you have hair and where is it? 
Goddammit Larry, you're just.. youre.. you're a fucking asshole
I think childhood you would be disappointed that adult you used the time machine to tell childhood you that R.L. Stine once answered one of your questions.
I've always had a special place in my heart for *Cloudy with a Chance of Menstruation*
I wonder if Peter Gabriel will pick it up just out of curiosity
Now I'm just picturing him dabbing and shit while he writes.
He says the same thing every AMA tho 
Easily my favorite music sub. Between new music, user activity, actual artists posting, minimal meta drama and overall positivity... it is very refreshing.
That's a great question I'd love to see answered as well. Always loved the covers and stories.
My favorite cover is Johnny Cash's version of NIN's "Hurt".
Amazing. The baking ghost episode was worth the wait. R.L. must have watched it n decided it was finally time to stop ignoring you guys 
Based off his stories I think we can assume he read the illustrated man.

I know! But it was only once I finished the original path!I had to know what ALL of the options were for the storyline! I was obsessed!My mom used to ground me from my books when I was bad!
Someone needs to get on this ASAP.  We can call them "Video Games"
Apologize, right now.
I think his favourite is the series he's writing, but he still didn't answer the first part :(
I never thought I would see "your writing literally made me vomit" be used as a compliment 
In fun and NORMAL ways
This book is more influential than gone with the wind 
It absolutely does.
Thank you for copy-pasting Wikipedia 
>please do not ask me about seals i do not understand them as animalsThis is golden.
there is nothing trolly or satirical about TRUE LOVE
I've been hearing some talk about this one. How similar is it to Twilight Zone?
The cheerleader series fucked me up for months. I don't even remember the books now, but I remember the fear.
He did.He's been interviewed about it and he said he doesn't think it's funny and he doesn't "get it."
Because he truly is one of the greatest horror writers of our generation.
And like that you've given that subreddit more traffic than it's seen in months.
For me, outlines are an imaginary shack that I build in my head and it's sort of made about of strewn about pieces of wood and nails.
I got mine from bookclub lol.
Good tip. If you find a new hobby or interest. There's a subreddit for it. I usually just google "[Hobby] Reddit"
Or as they're also known, Marvel's lawyers.
I loved that, the ol' Goosebumps switcharoo
I don't think so - I think the whole movie was based on an actual event.
Animorphs man... what a time to be a kid reading
I wasn't clever back then. At least he'll know that won't change.
Thats just spaghetti sauce dude... 
He dabs every time he finishes a chapter.

Fear Street was my LIFE 
To be fair, I think he was trying to say is you're too limited in movies with the 1.5-2 hour time length, whereas you could jam every detail about a character in literature. That's why it's very hard for directors to convey a book into a movie because of all the little details you have to masterfully implant in the short period of time without making it feel cluttered. Maybe I'm reaching, but that's what I got from that bit.
Say it anyways, because it's probably true?

/u/chooter for president with <3 .
I copped the same punishment as a kid, except my old man would throw in a twist. "Oh, sure, you can still read. Here, this is a geology book from 1987. Read away. I'm gonna quiz you after."Nothing says 'don't get caught doing something wrong' like having your entertainment options stripped down to 'pop quizzes on rocks'.
I think he did state in a recent article that he never wanted to deal with real-life terror (abuse, neglect, etc.) because he wanted to entertain, not traumatize. Not a complete answer but it's something that's stuck with me about him. 
IIRC it was written with the thought of "what would happen to children if they were placed into war in combat," which is pretty fucked to begin with.  I read everyone as a child but never realized how fucked up they were until later on.  Makes sense I guess how fucked up I turned out.
They actually met Hitler in a different timeline. WWII was going on anyways, and Hitler was just a driver. They were trying to hunt down a time-traveling maniac. This is after Jake gets shot in the head trying to cross the Delaware River with George Washington. The Animorphs were weird.

It's probably going to be trending tomorrow.**EDIT**: For future historical reference, it was not trending the next day.**EDIT2:** For more future historical reference, it was trending two days after this comment was made.

Good old scholastic book club. 
If it exists, there is ~~porn~~ a subreddit of it
Hold my ventriloquist dummy, I'm goin' in!
You know what, now that you point it out I must have been thinking of something else.
We lucked out with so much good material: Lemony Snicket's, the Harry Potter books, Artemis Fowl, Captain Underpants...
That's an awfully clever statement.
Mom's spaghetti?
What a coincidence. Me too. 
Did you know that swans can be gay?
It's a completely different medium though, and as an artist/author/director, you have to work within the restraints that medium requires. It would be like saying a painting can't be great, because it's one frame (where a movie might have tens of thousands of frames). It's two entirely different things and they should be judged with different criteria. 
This guy has it right!
I... I read geology books for fun.
Yeah, it's deliberately left up to your imagination whether or not Rachel kills him.
It's like if Red Dawn had less accents and more awkward puberty
Jesus christ, these were books for children!?
You nailed it. Then you leave that for the cabin in the woods and then that for a castle in a mythical land and then that for a secret government facility in Africa.
There's probably also a rule 34 version of that same subreddit.
I recently saw that documentary on Netflix and I'm amazed at how much R.L. Stine looks like Jack Black.
oh gosh, captain underpants - I remember that from 3rd grade.
the paradoxes mount
well. now there is vomit on my sweater. 
Broken arms.
You just know she did though.
Or, if you want Red Dawn but with *more* accents and awkward puberty, there's *Tomorrow, When The War Began*.
The entire series was about these aliens (Yeerks) would crawl through your ear to your brain and control your every action.  They could impersonate you perfectly since they had access to all your thoughts, emotions, and memories.  All while the host is completely aware of everything.  That in itself is nightmare material.
I forgot to mention that Star Wars Jedi Apprentice series for kids all about Obi Wan apprenticing underneath Qui Gon
jolly rancher
Of course. Jake always knew it, that if it came down to having to kill David, Rachel would be the one strong enough to do it. "Get Rachel."
you didn't even mention ants

oh god the ants
The mission of the Commission on Debates is to educate people about the presidential election. 76% of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates. End of argument.
Shedding the social conservative dogma of the Republican Party.  (On behalf of Gov. Weld, he feels the same way.)
No, we would initially target a 20% reduction in those bases.
I do believe that marijuana should be legalized, and I do believe California will legalize it in November, which will be a tipping point.  An example of a black market in marijuana is Washington state where a black market still survives due to too many taxes.
Honesty, transparency, not a hypocrite (not saying one thing and doing another).
The best way to reduce health care costs is to get more competition into the system. This means health savings accounts, this means not requiring everyone to buy a cradle-to-grave policy, but instead they could buy a catastrophic-injury policy and after that negotiate with individual vendors.
I would be Jon Snow.  My favorite Game of Thrones scene is Jon Snow, holding his sword, ready to be slain, only to survive.
Count on my support for majority vote.  Count on my support for ranked voting.  I believe it would have to be done via an amendment to the Constitution.
This needs to be so much higher. Native rights and politics is shameful right now, as it always has been.To put it in perspectiv in terms of social awareness and activism, there are far more Native Americans in this country than there are homosexuals (no, I'm not arguing that a race is a sexual orientation). If they had half the political capital of a much smaller group, then maybe we wouldn't see starvation on the Rez at 2x-3x the national average.
We could have Abe Lincoln from balanced rebellion be moderator! Lol
I'm obviously not /u/GovGaryJohnson, but look for a Libertarian Party press release on kratom very soon.
Check out the MilitaryTimes interview he did a few days ago. He goes into detail how he'd help. Good question though!
Johnson supporter here. I've been campigning for him since about 2010. Back then, noone knew him (mostly)...now I get 2-5 comments a day on my shirt or my bumper sticker. If someone complains about "I hate Hillary and Trump", tell them there is a viable 3rd option and have them google Gary Johnson. Like he said in the AMA earier, you may not agree with him 100%, but at least he is transparent and honest.
Really wish he could answer this. If he could sway me on this, I'd feel much more comfortable voting for him.
I believe I remember him saying positive things about nuclear, but the public would be too scared
They have mentioned that they wouldn't keep separate staffs.
The first Alien
He's said he would de-schedule it on day 1.
The best way to reduce health care costs is to get more competition into the system. This means health savings accounts, this means not requiring everyone to buy a cradle-to-grave policy, but instead they could buy a catastrophic-injury policy and after that negotiate with individual vendors.
I would be shocked if they supported banning it. My guess is the silence is due to it being a new issue and they don't want to say something without further research
> 76% of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates.What is this figure based on? Frankly, given the political apathy in this country, I'd be absolutely stunned if "76% of all voters in the United States" even knew Johnson-Weld are running. 
> Term limits is our one silver bullet for the poisonous dysfunction in Washington, D.C.But, Governor, wouldn't term limits lead to inexperienced legislators being taken gross advantage of by private interests, as we saw so clearly in the Texas energy barons' extortion of the California energy market?
I'm fairly certain that's exactly how Obama phrased it in his address to Canada.
Thank you! I think this is what holds the Republican party back the most. They have ideas that should certainly be heard, but when so much of it comes from virulently backwards social ideologies that don't have a place in 21st century America, it destroys so much of their claim.
What is the selection criteria?
That stance is widely known.  What I was asking about was other vices.  If you'll only answer one, I'd like to know about sports gambling since it is strangely legal in limited states yet a federal law restricts it in those not "grandfathered-in"
Like it or not, no. The constitution gives congress the power to create new states. Any local referendum has no real power, except to make it clear to congress what the people of the prospective state would like. 
Honestly I believe your legacy as it stands right now would be civility in a time of ruthless mudslinging. I admire so much your tact and courtesy, even in the face of two unfavorable opponents. I will be proud to vote for you!
* What happens to people who under-insure themselves?* What happens to children of people who under-insure those children?* Do you support the ban on pre-exisitng conditions?* If not, how will we deal with those who are not presented with affordable plans?* Do you support the system as it is, where employers can claim a tax break on insurance plans?
KING IN THE NORTH!
It would, the electoral college's function is explicitly laid out in the constitution so changing or removing it would require an amendment.
If you are so sane, why are you in politics?
I'll throw in my vote for Johnson if he changes his stance for privatized prisons. The problem with putting prisons into the hands of private owners is the fact that it allows for leeway into making prisons a sort of for-profit industry rather than a place for prisoners to be rehabilitated.
Guys, this is the chairman of the Libertarian National Convention; he did an AMA a few weeks ago and is in charge of the LP platform. His word here is as good as the word of the Governors. 
It's only recently gotten interest in the media. Candidates must be absolutely careful with what they say, I would assume he or his team are still researching the issue and deciding if it is safe to say yes he opposes the ban.
Just hearing a presidential candidate even mention being against the ban would sway me. I have an L4/L5 & L5/S1 injury and kratom has been a lifesaver for pain control for me.
never heard of it, can you fill me in?  I know too man suboxone abusers and want to see what else we can do to get people off of opioids
Agreed. Before the ban, I would have voted Trump just to avoid Clinton. Now, I would be willing to vote for whoever sincerely wants to overturn it or challenge the ban now.
So would we expect companies to stay in the US but just bring in entire workforces from other places? 
That's not what I'm worried about. Given the option, there's a fair number of people who will be willing to leave. However, I'm more concerned that programs that take care of us and our families being cut, instead of, you know, the Army just picking a fucking uniform and sticking with it already.
Were they "going to pass something" or did they have the ability to pass something by overriding a veto?
Okay fine, I can disregard the view that a free market will somehow magically provide healthcare to a greater number of people and of greater quality than would single-payer although this has never been seen in practice, because Alien is a pitch-perfect masterwork of sci-fi and gothic horror.Now I'm on board the Gary Johnson train. Choo choo.
Your knowledge of obscure films is impressive, sir. Your approval rate is soaring on my end.
Transparently speaking, what does this stance actually entail? 
Think you replied to the wrong comment, Governor; thanks for the response though!
Yeah, as much as I support Johnson I have a hard time taking this figure at face value.
Not to mention termed out Members of Congress make great lobbyists and board members for corporations whose regulations they wrote. Supporting the No Golden Parachutes for Public Servants Act would be a good fix. 
Frankly, because it would make him automatically discounted by too many voters. Anti-TPP is a growing, and legitimate movement. Sure, globally parts of it may have strategic benefit, but the people are done with sacrificing what's left of their freedoms and liberty for sake of protecting big corporations and 'progress' that only negatively affects them.
I've never wholeheartedly disagreed with a lot of big Republican government policies. But when they campaign for less government control, and turn around and want to propagate intelligent design in schools and fight against Planned Parenthood... it's such blatant hypocrisy. I can't support one policy without supporting the others, which is clearly the problem with the two-party system. (And yes, I know, not all Republicans are like that. But I'd bet 99% of social conservatives like that happen to be Republican.)
I would guess he would rely on the military advisors for that. Hard for a civilian to have anything other than a general plan.
I've come out in favor of legalizing online poker. I think sports gambling should be legal, too.
plus the video was really funny and sad...mostly sad that Clinton and Trump have so much support.
Didn't he literally call Trump "a pussy?"I thought that was kind of hilarious, but I'm not sure I'd call it courteous or tactful.
Mmm, International Roast
NSA had it on file. See? Maybe they're not so bad after all. 
KeePass FTW
> based on what I knowthis is so important
I was kind of expecting a strange computer guy with computer guy social skills but he's very well spoken.
Yeah, tell him to mention it in an AMA or something!
I honestly don't mind them repeating it in an AMA. I've given up following the election beyond a glance here and there, so I had no idea about this, and it's certainly something I'm glad to know.
Big companies lobby to stamp out competition. 
Corporate sponsored regulations are what got us in this mess in the first place. While deregulating everything immediately would obviously be a bad idea, slowly peeling back all the barriers of entry that the ISP oligopoly has erected would be a great boon to the internet.
I would not be surprised to see Utah and New Mexico turn gold on election night.
Libertarians don't have good answers to these questions. Competition doesn't work when people are dealing with their health. The Free Market makes sense when we're talking about categories where the laws of supply and demand can be applied. Health Care is not one of those categories. 
The epipen had its priced jack specifically because their competition vanished. There are several companies trying to get alternate injectors out there, but they've been blocked by the FDA. So my guess is that changing the regulation around approval, and speeding up the process, would help here.
They die.  As they should.   Didn't you read atlas shrugged or the fountainhead before this ama? 
DAKINGINDANORF!!
A human being, that's who.
I heard him on other interviews and he cited that problem among who shall pay for the tax,( the consumer, the energy company, the company that extracts it?) and other concerns.
He has my upvote.
Why aren't you?
In this moment I am euphoric.Not because of any phony presidential candidate, but becauseI am enlightened by Gov. Johnson's Intelligence
This ignores the motives of those running the public prisons, which make up over 90% of the prisons in the US. Just like private individuals, the government workers who run and work for public prisons and the unions that support them all have incentive to lobby and push for policies that increase incarceration. Given the fact that a vast majority of our prisons are public, I think private prisons have simply become a scapegoat for these fundamental problems surrounding incarceration.
Now *this* is what I call follow-up. Better than some of his own AMA answers
Yeah, I'm sure Johnson knows people use it as a medicine. I wish you the best.
My wife asked me how i could support bernie and now support johnson.It comes down to integrity.  You can go far to the left, and far to the right, and both can work out just fine, as long as there is mutual respect from both sides.Sanders and johnson are statesmen.  Hillary and trump are soooo fuckin 90's.Were done with hollywood.
~~Its definitely Bill Weld. He can play multiple games of chess simultaneously while blindfolded.~~*EDIT* Apparently this isn't so clear cut.
Don't you get it? Without a new camo pattern, it might be possible for a goat fucker in a hut to see you from 5 klicks out while you call in an artillery strike!
They had a super majority, so they would have easily overriden a veto. 
Bill Weld must be one of the most cultured politicians I have ever seen. And he doesn't even hide it. In a debate Kerry accusses him of being too wealthy and out of touch. He answers with a quote on Latin. He just doesn't give a fuck about the anti-intelectuals and I love him for that.
He invoked state's rights rather than outright support amnesty  because he realizes his stance would offend many conservatives that are dissatisfied with Trump, but aren't libertarians.
I doubt 76% of voters could correctly identify both presidential candidates by name, let alone their running mates.
They didn't join because they didn't see it as a net benefit to their domestic economy. Gov. Weld responded as if the goal of the TPP was to deepen the American economic foothold in East and SE Asia in order to counter China, when in reality it was assumed that China would join (or at least think about joining) the agreement. They weighed their options and decided not to join.The invitation is still open, so they could join literally any time they wanted. They choose not to.
>(And yes, I know, not all Republicans are like that. But I'd bet 99% of social conservatives like that happen to be Republican.)Oooh, I've met socially conservative democrats. They're scary folks.
Unfortunately their base is full of people who think America is a Christian country and should uphold Christian values.
So he doesn't know more than the generals? /s
Thank you for coming back to my question.  This is a very refreshing take on gambling. 
Feel free to PM me if you feel up to talking. We're all in this together :)
"Like a 2 horse race, where one horse cheats and the other horse eats muslims"
IIRC they have to ask (by voting) and Congress has to confirm it.
Poster's Choice
Its a good statement. As Snowden showed us, there's sooooo much that they don't tell the public. 
This would be legitimately incredible.  Even winning one state is a colossal win not just for the Libertarian Party, but third parties as a whole.I am sadly in a state where this is basically impossible, but best of luck to voters in these states.
I love that it was you of all people to clarify him on his own polls :)
This. The free market relies on the ability to negotiate. When your health is on the line you are effectively held at gunpoint, given a bill, and told to pay... or else. That's not free market. That's extortion. 
Europe has 4 or 5 competing manufacturers and you can get epipens for about $45 over the counter. this is not government subsidized healthcare, this is just the market. 
and put it on some fucking tshirts
That sounds... sexual.
An honest human being.... for a change.
AND MY AXE !
Hey, he didn't say *he* was sane. 
He's a libertarian, so it will be positive. 
Keeping it legal will save many from pain and addiction. 
I voted for Johnson in 2012, and I'll probably vote for him in 2016, but I was really hoping to be able to vote for Sanders in 2016.My reasons for both are that I like the guy that comes along and says, "Let's try something new and see if it fixes our problem." Johnson wants to try some new things, Bernie wanted to try some new things.What I don't want is Hillary saying, "Let's do the things we've always done and see if it fixes the problem." or Trump saying, "Let's make more problems and see if we have problems."
But Gary beat him when they played.
John Kerry accusing someone else of being too wealthy is rich.
It's even better hearing it in your head in his voice.
"As Governor I would have supported you" is pretty outright support, though.  He just doesn't think it's the President's job.
You are doing amazing for your first time!
The poll that figure is from had a question with something along the lines of "if a candidate is on ballots in the majority of states, should they be a nvluded in the debates." it wasn't specific to this ticket, though it did have their qualifications covered. 
As a an OEF/OIF vet, FUCK the IAVA.
Not really - an organization can be bi-partisan and still be a tax exempt organization.  Its not like you can cherry pick certain organizations and drop their tax status because of disagreeing with what they do.
The IAVA is important because Johnson polls highly (some polls say the highest) among active duty military. The IAVA claims to represent veterans and service members--yet they refused to allow the most supported candidate in their debates. I'm an OEF vet myself and Johnson supporter, and it's a huge slap in the face. 
Exactly. Presidents aren't looking for their next job after their final terms. Congressmen are, and possibly will give favors while in office to facilitate that. 
The primary concern was with copyright law. Any expansion in copyright law and penalties for breaking those laws can basically always be considered a bad thing. 
No, everyone knew China probably wouldn't join, but they couldn't just not invite them because that would be rude and would look antagonistic. If they did join though, they'd basically be submitting themselves to American-designed rules that would strongly benefit the United States and force China to adapt. The TPP helps us whether China is in it or not - either our allies get richer and stronger as a counterweight to China, or we force China to abide by our rules.
In the words of Robin Williams, "It's like a Volvo with a gun rack, what the hell?!"
I'm a Christian, actually a worship director for two relatively large churches in California, and I am always telling people this:We should focus our efforts on changing hearts, not laws. Even Jesus said that to obey the letter of the law is not enough. Sure you didn't murder that guy, but if you hold hatred in your heart you are still in sin. So forcing your morality upon people through laws, guns, and prisons does nothing for the kingdom of God. And in fact it alienates those with whom you might otherwise have had an opportunity to share God's love. 
*Believe me*
To be fair, they represent their state, and taking jobs away from people in their states would be a pretty negative impact and would go against the interest of those they represent.
I didn't think he was coming back. Good stuff. :)
It's a great answer really. Covers his ass if Gary actually was in a position of power to bring Snowden back.
Join the party. I'm a conservative in NY. Even a Republican winning isn't remotely possible. This is my biggest reason to vote Johnson. Lol. No one I vote for will win. (since I don't vote for corrupt career politicians who knowingly violated federal law...) thus if I vote Johnson it's out of protest to the current party system and to try to help boost the LP. 
What can I say, we like $$$
That's his secret, Clinton is always coming.
/r/CheckYourJohnson 
Is someone on this?
Welcome to reddit.
The fact that a person with the username /u/fingerinurbutt could or could not be someone from my IT department is what's gonna get me out of bed tomorrow morning
Agreed.  I consider myself a moderate libertarian and environmental regulations is the biggest thing I diverge on.  The arguments of individuals suing, or "it's in the landowner's best interest not to pollute so they won't" is insane.  It's not magical Christmas land.  Johnson's response here thrilled me. 
He's pretty reasonable, which, until this election, I didn't realize was a trait I needed in a candidate. 
Start small. Run for local office, gain trust from donors, do a good job, climb the ladder.
Yes, it definitely helps with all opiate/opioid addiction.
Hahaha your last line about trump is... succint, and accurate.
REMATCH! REMATCH!
I feel that disagreement is part of being American, and the greatest part is our capability to announce dissention without true fear. Unless you're at a football game.
So he was lying when he said 76% of voters asked for them by name?
As an relatively uninformed individual (referring to myself, not you if that wasn't clear), is that kind of in the form of legislation that is trying to be slipped in relatively unnoticed or to sweeten the deal for someone, or do at least you personally find that it directly deals with the rest of the contents of the TPP?
I am not a Christian, and I agree with you. Convince people, don't force people.
*I know the best people.*
I had money on it
>  Covers his ass if Gary actually was in a position of power to bring Snowden back.I think it's pretty line with how Gary talks.  He prefaces a ton of his desires for what he'd do as president for things like "If Congress submitted..."I chalk it up to him being governor and so understanding his real limitations along with being from a party of pie-in-the-sky hyperbolic ideologues. 
I'm registered R in Cali.  I don't know if I'll change my party affiliation (yet, anyway), but I'm strongly leaning Johnson at this point.  Not only does he fit my views more than any other candidate, but a vote for Johnson isn't wasted even here, as it can still go towards the 15% goal.I also have the privilege of conservative / mixed local government (Central Valley), so at least some people I vote for will win.  I feel for those who don't even get that.
Monica's dress wasn't that special.
Who downvoted him? Get the fuck out of here he gave you a reasonable answer.
This must be live streamed. 
Cuff him boys 
On the other hand, everybody should preface all of their opinions with "based on what I know". Unless we want a candidate who won't change their mind in the face of new evidence.
The party bosses and people who work within the machinery of the parties do care. Those are the people who value party over people and ideas.
JR podcast by night! 
Please! it would be great to hear them calmly playing a game of chess and causally talking about the issues. 
Bake him away, toys
Bernie did this a lot too and I respected him greatly for it. If there's one thing I look for in a person, let alone a candidate, is the ability to admit when you were wrong. 
Your comment makes me feel bad that /r/sandersforpresident has been closed down by mods :(
Probably still not safe doing
If I were to guess it's a contractual obligation.Sony paid a network to run a certain number of commercials, and the Network still wishes to receive money but they don't want to keep the ad spread out over the next few weeks.Just my best guess
What if it bombs?
james is kil
Straight to torrent is more likely. Who buys dvd's?
Their moms said they're not allowed to use the computer anymore after that whole 'fappening' thing.
Then they'll threaten the cable compa... ...hey, wait, maybe that's not such a bad idea. 
Agreed.  I find this very confusing.  Hasnt NK threatened nuclear war like every other month to SK and friends?
I really hope they don't crash my lunch date...
This is the start of a new genre of filmmaking: suicidal-modernism
That will happen, just wait for it. 
Will there even be a pirate version?
Team America was lampooning American arrogance as well, and Kim Jon Il was a huge film buff and would have understood that. Hell, the major thing they mocked about him was the Korean dialect. The Interview is supposed to be pretty damning of the North Korean regime according to an NPR story I was listening to earlier. 
Offer it for free to just one theater chain... Let the other choke on the popcorn dust
No major movie theater is willing to show it, Sony has no outlet. Blame AMC and Regal.
It's like Hostess going under only to make "The Sweetest Comeback in the History of Ever!" except... "The Movie You Could Have DIED Seeing Is Now Back From The Dead!"
Don't worry...you'll still be able to watch this right after they've finished soaking up every last drop of pure unadulterated free publicity that this whole stunt has to offer.
That would be hilarious if they did a shitty dub, in just one scene maybe, to make fun of all this and instead of his real name they dub Kim Bong Uh and North Candyland. I could imagine Seth dubbing it in a high pitched voice. If they did it once it would be funny, otherwise it would get old.
Of course! We'll just defeat North Korea with memes! If only we'd though of it sooner!
how easy?i've seen estimates that the damage might be up to $100 million.Then theater chains started getting cyber and physical attacks and backed out.They could have allowed some theaters to run it, but it would have a horrible opening weekend, and then there's the danger of those theater chains being attacked too.Why would AMC or Regal risk this kind of crippling cyber attack over a movie?
Release it as a post credit scene to the next spiderman
Kim Jong In is vastly less secure than his father and is thus less able to accept satire like this.
And Colbert as well 
If they don't want anyone to talk about it, they won't let it get to the lawsuit stage. They'll pay everyone to shut up about it. 
they got supported, they were paid to make the film.they have free speech. The government didn't stop the film from being shown. Instead the company that paid them to create the film for them has decided to not show it.
No, but they could still attack movie theatres as a statement about the film being released. Either way people die.Having said that, I think they should release the film. Hell, I'll even go and watch it on opening day and see if I get blown up.I say that for two reasons. First, North Korea has always been nothing but empty threats. Second, if it takes a terrorist act for the US to finally move and bring freedom to the North Koreans, a country that ACTUALLY FUCKING NEEDS freedom then let's bring this shit on.
If this was found out to be true I would be turned off seeing it if anything.
Hell they don't even need to release it for free, I'd pay $5 to rent it.
Marujuana 
I agree with this comment. They most likely pay for a block of time. 
Well, that hasn't worked quite well for North Korea.
If it turns out to be a promotional stunt, I see a class action lawsuit. I think its real.  Sony got fucked up last few weeks. Like those are real peoples lives leaked onto the internet. I don't see why they would go forward with an ad campaign with that. No one would forgive them or take them seriously ever again.
In that case, I think The Interview with him would be even more important.
Ask DJ Khaled for more servers then
If that happened, would he speak Korean or English? To go even further can Kim speak anything other than Korean.
Then we need to get Putin involved too. 
That pun was il advised. 
You are now banned from /r/pingpong

Can confirm, Am posting from phone.
Not my Google Fiber!
BRING IT ON!
Sure, but it wasn't a few chains of movie theaters who decided whether to react or not to nuclear threats. They hacked a movie studio, threatened to hurt people at the theaters. Theater chains weren't interested in calling their bluff and decided not to run the movie. Sony couldn't distribute it in the intended way, so they pulled it. This was not an attack on the American government. Also, Sony (separate divisions) has suffered hacks several times recently. 
But they won't release it on DVD either.
I haven't even had Third Lunch yet today! 
Sounds like the first episode of Black Mirror.
I hope the leaker turns out to be peanutbutt
Yup eye patches and everything.
True fact: being not just actors but also writers producers etc... they couldve gained way WAY more than what sony paid them already.
Do you have a source on Kim Jong Ill  being big into movies? That's kind of fascinating and I'd be interested in reading some more. 
Maybe it's that hacker, 4chan. 
Banned it? Do they have movies at all in North Korea? 
Completely agree.  Front line poontang are the theater chains.
It's hard to release a movie when all the theaters won't show it and Video on Demand services won't carry it.  Remember that in the US, theaters are legally responsible for the safety of everyone inside even without a well advertised threat in advance.
I think people would still blame Sony to some degree. If there was an attack on a theater, everyone would just talk about how Sony cared so much about making money that they were willing to risk - and cost - human life.Not saying it's right or wrong, but if they released the movie and something happened, Sony would never be able to live it down.
its not CG, in fact they actually killed the glorious leadermay he rest in peace
Well, that was real and just good marketing tied into it. 
Wake up sheeple!!
It's more likely that North Korea can actually follow through on their worse than 9-11 threats.
Look, people threatened to attack the theatres that showed the movie. So all the theatres refused to play the movie. Sony didn't cancel the movie as a publicity stunt, they literally have nowhere to show it. 
Or just have the classic censor bleep over it 
If it only costs $5 to contact famous/important people through reddit users, could one of you tell Tony Abbott to go fuck himself for me?I'll pledge five bucks or reddit gold for that cause.
We did it Reddit!
Yes it was easy. All that happened was an anonymous hacker group indirectly threatened any theater. All they said was that anyone who wants to see the movie, should stay home and remember 9/11. The FBI, Homeland Security, and the Obama Administration don't even see it as a credible threat. So yeah, the theaters caved in really easily. 
Not to mention this just happened today and programming is usually set a few days ahead of time. 
We are talking about them.
Bill Cosby loves pudding.Pudding his dick where it doesn't belong.
Oh I think this is real as well. I'm assuming Sony can't pull all of the ads from every channel, movie theater, or website that quickly, so that's why they're still up. 
nice joke beroh
DJ Khaled pls let us use most powerful servers pls
Kim Jong Un was sent away in his formative years to be educated in the west, believe it or not. According to Wikipedia he spent time at English-speaking schools in Bern, Switzerland as well Koniz, Switzerland from at least 1993 - 1998. Apparently the Kim clan is/was known to use Switzerland as a family gathering location as well.
Think of it like this. Tywin Lannister is the most powerful man in Westeros. But pissing Joffrey off is still a horrible idea.
Haha yeah, somehow I've managed to do that. and when I do an "er", the tail of the "e" becomes the hook on the "r", as shown. I've got a few handwriting quirks.
Just a tad?
You are now a moderator of /r/tabletennis 
If anyone would know it'd be this guy
Greater good man, the greater good! 
I wish they had gotten that movie pulled.
Would you like to know more?
they didn't catch that guy yet?
Well, it looks like the terrorists have won. 
They do actually, it has a very Soviet bloc, post-revolution China feel last time I saw a piece on NK cinema. A lot of "Young girl deals with doubts about her nation before overcoming her disloyal thoughts and becoming a glorious servant of the Great Leader and the Korean people!"
Read that as 'front line Pyongyang'. Appropriate, I suppose..
It would be absurd if Sony tried to hold theaters to their contract when there was a specific that against those theaters.  You could never win that court case.  It was a nonenforceable contract at this point. Sony made every reasonable attempt to keep this movie alive
Not from third party violence they're not.
It's not like we have to wait a year to see the movie...
OR EVEN WORSE, what if this whole thing was orchestrated by Hitler in his immortal state inside a lab somewhere in South America so he could finally break Sony's defense and become the cyber Hitler he was always meant to be.
At $5 a pop, I'd need Bill Gates wealth to send fuckagrams to everyone who deserves them. 
Are you questioning the Glorious Leader?
Worked in ad sales, can confirm. Everything is plotted out quarterly and networks are anywhere between live and 4 to 5 days out. If a plane crashes and gets decent news coverage you'll be spending your evening getting as many of that airline's commercials off the air as possible. 
Exactly. They literally just pulled the plug on the movie hours ago. They have more on their minds than trying to cancel commercials, which probably are already paid for and programmed in by the networks.
Yeah what a bunch of pussies. They wouldn't even release people's personal information or fake a potential act of war for a movie. No balls on them.
WE DA BESS
Say my name. 
Aw you are!
Ya, that smooth transition from "e" to "r" was what struck me first, but I figured it could have been a coincidental line-up until I saw the hook on the next "r" was barely touching the line and so wasn't part of the upstroke.And then I had nothing better to do (clearly) so I decided to call you out on it. :P
Your username is a lie!
>I will DL bit torrentEasy there grandpa. 
Th' grea'er good!
I think you're on the right track, so far they've been inconsistent and vague in their message to the extreme, and things like the encoding of the malware is something that can be edited at compilation or even after the fact, it doesn't mean it was actually coded in korean or on a pc with korean set as the language. If anything it could be NK capitalizing on GOP's attack for their own purposes.
Nope, I'm still around. 
Terrorists win all the time. If it wasn't successful, people would have given up on it long ago.
Probably. And then more people would freak the fuck out. I'm already working Christmas day with 3 movie premiers, another premier and a looming possibility of dying from terrorists/idiots with firecrackers does not sound pleasant.
I can see how this would go with me. I'd watch it and then feel all patriotic at the end because my brain is stupid and doesn't realize stuff. I need to find a movie now to test my theory. 
Did they ever end up making any movies for him? 
These are the 3 same arguments i see in every fuckin thread. Nice 
yea, that was the worst part. That's like censoring the black bar censoring exposed breasts/genitals.
Yes, from third party violence.  Remember the Aurora shooting at the premiere of *The Dark Knight Rises*?  The victim's families sued the theater for not anticipating the shooting and increasing security.  The theater tried to get it thrown out as they cannot predict crime.  The judge ruled the suit could continue because the theater was aware that violent things happen sometimes.So if they can have a case brought against them for that, imagine what a theater that had massively publicized advanced warning would get.
OR EVEN WORSE THAN THAT..... ahh fuck it.
Um.. Uh... No?
You would think that your bowels would totally and completely cement and the hemorrhoids would painfully cripple you before the gout would.
Geeze I never thought about how important is must be to not be seen advertising after a tragedy you were involved in. That's intense.
Damn son, where'd ya find this?
Rick Ross is actually losing weight.
All I can say is when he steps up in the building, everybody's hands go Up and they stay there and they say yeah.

Thanks friend!
Omg the government is going to get your email from Reddit admins and then they'll know where you live.
I believe they made him direct a really shitty anti-capitalist version of *Godzilla*, which a Japanese executive convinced the regime to release to the world on DVD.
The reddit academy of how to make speculation sound like concrete evidence
I think the argument they used was the Colorado shooting. After that people tried to sue the cinema for damages but the cinema used the defence that it was not reasonably forseeable.In this case, there is a threat and therefore in any culminating lawsuit should an attack happen, they can't use that same defence.
If I remember correctly...Despite censoring the episode hardcore, in the following season of South Park they show Mohammad in ***every single episode*** of the following season (in the opening sequence).
Honestly that judge sounds crazy. I hope an appeal was filed.
It can always get worse. Add ants. Now it's worse.

He's probably using that "private browsing" we've all been hearing about.
Class of 2014
Got a pic or source on this? I'm curious if Trey and Matt did this.
This was ruled on a motion to have the case thrown out, not on the case itself.  The theater lost that motion, but if memory serves ultimately won the case.
I'm... I'm confused. Is that a satire? I've seen the sub before, I've just never asked. 
Wung Un.  
hold up baby, SAY MY NAME
Oh that guy. Cool.
D! J!  KHALED!
SHOUTOUT TO THE PEAR
I appreciate that!
I fired my drone missile on that IP. It should be there any minute.
So point being, they could legally sue, not that they could win. In big cases like this, it's not even about winning or losing because the lawyer fees are so steep, it's about not going to court in the first place. Also, the publicity of losing a case like that just leads to more and more similar cases, so it's not worth the risk.
The news itself is not, the comments are one big circlejerk.Praise to our Supreme Leader!

RIP /u/PlaceHolder12345
Someone finally answered one of my deepest questions
I guess it's simply acknowledgement that the news itself is satire of itself without having to be altered. My head hurts now.
This act of cowardice is completely Kim Jong-Unforgivable.
This has been knowledge for a while, nothing an exec probably doesn't know.
I have watched most of them. I don't find it difficult to watch because I went through it. I've seen it all. I still remember a friend of mine who was hanged because he was using a telephone wire as a belt to hold up his pants. They hung him and he fell back down. They put him back up and hung him again.
They need to tell story as it is. You cannot shy away from history and its brutality. We usually learn about history through books, but this is an event that happened in my lifetime, I witnessed it, and I am still alive today to discuss it. Soon, there will not be any survivors left. I am 92. Once all the survivors are gone, the skeptics will probably come into the picture unfortunately. And that is why we need to educate everyone about what really happened. It didn't happen 500 years ago. It happened in my lifetime.
Life is beautiful. I love seeing my family. 
I was first sent to Drancy, a transit camp. I was then transported in a cattle car packed with people with no food or water and one bucket in the middle to use as a toilet. I was ~~16~~ 18 at the time.  The smell was unfathomable. After six days in the train the train came to stop. The guards started to count men. They selected 300 men. I was number 298. We were taken off the train. The train then continued on its way to Auschwitz and everyone was killed. I will never forget the number 298.
I thought it was as close as you can come. It was very well done.
I wanted to travel and see the world. I went forwards, not backwards. It was a very difficult transition back into real life. I had 3/4 of my stomach taken out from an infection I got while at the camps. This was painful.
I used to go out at night risking my life to steal some raw potatoes from the kitchen at Peiskretscham and at Blechhammer. I took chances. At Blechhammer some inmates caught a dog, a German Shepard, and cooked it. It was a feast. Tasted like rabbit. That was the only time I've eaten dog, and it was the best meal I had in a long time. These days I prefer steak.
I had dysentery in Gross Rosen and I couldn't go to the bathroom for three days. This was when I almost gave up. 
Going back to normal life was difficult. People didn't want to talk about the war and didn't see anything special about surviving the camps. People didn't want to discuss it.
I asked the american soldier if he knew my brother. My brother had gone to US a few years before and enlisted in the army.
I cannot forgive. But I was never consumed by hate. Hate doesn't improve anything. 
I got divorced after 49 and a half years of marriage. We still talk to each other once in a while. I now have a girlfriend, and I'm very happy. My ex-wife got remarried shortly after the divorce to a family friend. I never stayed single for too long! My ex-wife was also hidden during the Holocaust with a christian family.
Everyday you think of living. We are born to die, but I appreciate life. We live day by day, and I always say: yesterday is history, today's reality, and tomorrow's a dream. 
Some people ate too much and got very sick from that. I ate slowly and slowly recovered. It took maybe four to five months to get back to a normalish weight.
Most people had no idea. Anyone who knew what was going on was already at the gas chamber or in the camps.
I never had anxiety or depression. I'm lucky I guess. I'm 92 and my health is very good. I go dancing, I travel, and I love life. I'm busy, I'm active, and love sharing my story to schools in Miami and my time at the Holocaust memorial in miami.
I love sharing my story, but don't even know what reddit is. My grandson has always wanted me to share my story to as many people as possible so he suggested this. 
The soldiers were doing their job, and I cannot recall any compassion from any soldier. 
I was too young to understand what was happening.
No. Every survivor has his or her own story. I was interviewed by Spielberg and have that on tape. I think every survivor was interviewed by him to document the living survivors.
There was many times I almost lost hope. It was difficult to get the stamina to keep going. I just hoped I would survive and lived day by day. I returned to Drancy where I was deported from. My name is on a wall in Paris with 76,000 names of people who got deported from there. I don't think many survived.
Never forgive, never forget.
>"he once saw a guy at the camp kneeling and praying. He said 'what are you doing?' The guy said he was thanking God. 'What could you possibly be thanking God for?' ' I'm thanking God for not making me like them.'" 
You cannot deny history. They should be punished someway, but I'm not sure that imprisonment is the right way. But lots of people are ignorant and sometimes there's very little you can do about that.
I don't remember ever seeing someone passing by. People wear long sleeve shirts so it's usually covered up. I have met other people with numbers at holocaust events in the past though.
Yes. Definitely.
The secret is to enjoy whatever you do in my life. Think positive. I'm also very lucky to be in the shape I am and I still have my mind. 
I cannot take back anything, and I cannot regret anything. We were treated worse than animals. My name was 177153.
I honestly didn't comprehend it when I was liberated. I was very sick at the time. I stayed in a house for two weeks and then i went back to Belgium. Somebody gave me clothes to wear and that's all i had.
I never planned an escape. There were electric fences and you were wearing uniforms. I never witnessed any possible escapes.
To teach everyone what the Holocaust was and to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself. I didn't personally learn anything from the Holocaust. We have one life to live and you have to enjoy it. There is no room for hate in this world. 
I've been to her house in Amsterdam, but I actually have never read her diary. Every survivor (and even non-survivor in the case of Anne Frank) has a different story. Every story needs to be shared.
I really didn't understand it. I was confused. I didn't know I was free.
My brother was very relieved to know that I made it out alive. My parents and sister and her child were all sent to Auschwitz. It would have been tough on him to know that his entire family was killed. But that was the reality many people faced. 
I was captured in France. While trying to buy grapes at a market. They asked for my papers and that was it.
That dictatorships are not good. They fulfill the dream of one person. And unfortunately they are still in existence today.
Usually at night we got a piece of bread and some watery soup. In the morning sometimes we got a cup of coffee. I used to scrape and eat the coffee grinds from barrels and in the morning to get a little sustenance. We would also break the piece of bread we got at night in two, and save the other half for the morning. That is what i remember.
I have been before, and I plan to go again soon.
I do not remember seeing these. I'm sure they were there, but some things stick out in my memory more than others.
If you have a desire to live, you will do what it takes to exist for the next day. 
The chances of me recalling someone is very small. Feel free to post it though and I'll take a look.
I was very young while in Vienna so I don't remember much. My education stopped when I was 14. I'm self educated. I know five languages- English, French, German, Yiddush, and some Hebrew.
Thank you for your time Sir, it's an honor to be able to ask you questions. 
Common last name. 
I think it's wonderful if you date Jewish women, but that is not necessary. In my opinion, it is necessary in life to be happy. I can't really agree with her statement because if that involves you marrying someone that you're not happy with then it's not worth it.
Bad things are happening all over the world today. I think humans are capable of terrible things. To me, I think it's possible for something like this to happen again in the future, but not at the same scale. I think without Israel, it could happen again. 
I cannot recall coming across any black jews. I tell them we were just a number, not human beings. We were not called by names, just by our numbers. 
I would not accept that. I am absolutely against it. I would find it very distasteful.
Depends on the age, but you have to explain slowly. It's very difficult to understand.
It's hard to remember. I'm sure there was, but I cannot recall.
You cannot tell me it didn't happen. I went through it. I have never met anyone who has denied that it happened. If I did, it would be apparent that they're not educated, or extremely ignorant, or both. 
I never received any kindness from soldiers. 
That's horrifying
Wow. Very well said. Thank you for doing this!!
That's awesome.  My grandpa was a turret gunner in WWII, and his older brother was a pilot.  They're currently 90 and 93.
Now that you mention this, what you think about this movie?
Do you mark or celebrate your liberation day in any way?
Lol I meant won
Why did they take 300 off? Why not just kill everyone? Also, so sorry for what you've had to go through in your life, but glad you're here with us through it all. 
It's been on my list for a while, but you just made me buy it. Thank you. 
Where was the first place you traveled to after your release?
How did you manage to get by with killing and eating it?  I would assume it was a guard dog, wouldn't they have noticed? 
Your will to survive has inspired me! Thank you for not giving up 
This is completely unfathomable to me. This seems like: we are so afraid to be uncomfortable, or to make others uncomfortable, that we don't know how to check on people or offer comfort. At the same time, I think some would feel this makes it easier to move on? Either way, I'm sorry for that. Thank you for doing this AMA.
What was his response?
I spoke to another holocaust survivor recently (I am an ambassador for the Holocaust Educational Trust) and they stated they cannot forgive because many of them choose to deny that they were a part of it or that it had ever happened.What are your thoughts on the people that deny the holocaust?
I forgot to mention something important i think pertains to my Grandmas story. A few years ago she returned to thank the descendants of the family that rescued her. She didn't get the heartwarming welcoming she thought she would. Instead the remaining family members hated her for putting their family at such an extreme risk. They wouldn't even meet with her. It depressed her that such a mentality could be taken, as opposed to them being proud of their families courage and heroism. It's sad that hate can be born from such a loving action. 
>yesterday is history, today's reality, and tomorrow's a dream./r/getmotivated would drop a picture of a sunset to this 
I'm willing to guess you still remember the very first thing you had to eat after being liberated. What was it?
I don't know what I expected but now that I have some insight, the Holocaust sounds way darker.
Eisenhower knew that people would try to deny it, so he made a point of securing as much evidence as possible (photo, video, tours)
> When the allies liberated the camp they were forced to bury the deadThis is part of the movie Band of Brothers
Enjoy the Weather, from one Florida resident to another.
Your grandson is a wise man.
That's a humbling "understand rather than criticize" statement.
As someone who grew up in Providence, have you ever been there? If so what were your thoughts?
I didn't even know Spielberg interviewed survivors. Thank you so much for sharing with us today, I have a lot to learn. 
Thank you so much, and everyone else for the info.
Thank you for taking the time to reply to my comment. I've been reading your other replies and my heart is full and heavy with the stories of your strength through loss. You are a remarkable person. 
I appreciate this. It's honest and it's against a fluffy narrative. You don't forgive people who do this kind of crime and horror to others. You choose not to be angry at them, thus unchaining yourself instead. Thank you for your stories. 
My best friend's grandfather lost his faith for a very similar reason, except he was actually a liberator of a camp (I forgot which though)
Thanks so much for the answer. I have so much respect for that. I once saw a quote (don't recall who). "if you go into a shul(synagogue) and see a person with numbers praying, that is a person who can bestow a bracha (blessing)
> I cannot take back anything, and I cannot regret anything. We were treated worse than animals. My name was 177153.Those three sentences hold a universe of wisdom and pain. Thank you for doing this so that we can always remember and hopefully prevent any such thing from happening again.
> Somebody gave me clothes to wear and that's all i had.Wow
Thank you for the response, it's amazing to have an interaction with you. Have a lovely day!
Do you think its important that people keep visiting places like Auschwitz or that it's disrespectful? Have you visited Auschwitz since they started tours at the memorials?
My grandfather spent quite a few years in a prisoner of war camp in Poland, and as he described it, the average German that got dragged into the Nazi tasks, generally were given a choice of not questioning command and being compliant, or being shot in the head. They mentally broke the ones that didn't have the mindset because they just wanted to survive as well.  The average soldier did not run the Jewish camps, it was the extremists of the Nazi party that were running those camps.
My understanding is that when you've got such a large system that's so well entrenched and everyone just goes along with it, it's hard to question it. The soldiers involved probably never thought to question it because they never saw any opposition to it - it never occurred to them that what they were doing might be wrong.
I never thought of it this way.  
Everyone was marked as to why they were at the camp. The pink triangle represented homosexual.
I understand you probably won't read this - but even if one wanted to survive more so than anything then how could he avoid being killed? I respect your will to live but sometimes things are just beyond our control.
I couldn't agree more. Soon there will be no one left to tell first hand stories
Maybe he misheard/misquoted from 'hundreds if not thousands' or something. It is still an interesting question though.
 Our current education minister in Israel decided that 5 years old kids should learn about the holocaust since kindergarden. That led to a pretty big discussion about this issue.
>I was never consumed by hate. Hate doesn't improve anything.
One thing I've seen depicted inaccurately in a few times in films or TV recreations is the gas in the chambers venting out as a vapour or even coming out of the fake showerheads. In reality Zyklon B pellets were dropped in from small holes in the roof and would release hydrogen cyanide gas after mixing with the heat and moisture of the prisoners.
My guess is this was a symbol of self-respect and they didn't want him to have any dignity
Amazing how much we can still learn about the Holocaust decades after it happened. These AMA are nothing like the textbooks.
I'm really curious. On what grounds are people skeptical? Like what's their argument for why/how it was fabricated? I honestly can't get my head arround it.
i might be blind or maybe a comment didnt load, what movie are you talking about?
I have two birthdays. March 14th, and April 11th. 
thank you!
I was born in 1924, and was a prisoner in 1942. So I was 18. And I was 21 when I was liberated. 
Well, you weren't wrong, depending on your perspective.
My guess is that the 300 they took off were selected to do work for them. They only needed 300 workers so the rest were sent off to be killed.
Set aside an evening to watch it on your own or with a close friend/partner, and just sit there in silence. The first time I watched Schindler's List made far more of an impression on me than I was expecting.
I went back to Brussels, and that's where I met my wife.
Since dysentery is bloody diarrhea, where actually going would probably not be a problem (despite how awful it would be), I imagine the Nazis would not let him go. 
After reading a bit, it looks like he was alive and in Providence, RI.
Wow. I am shocked by that response to your Grandma by that family! My Oma's family was one of the German families who helped in hiding Jewish families during that time and I cant fathom feeling anything other than pride for what they did! I would be honoured to meet someone from a family that my family helped. It's a piece of my family history that I am so so proud of and wish I knew more about!
Definitely has a one up on most of Reddit.
> My ex-wife got remarried shortly after the divorce to a family friend.
That subreddit is like the epitome of tacky.
"Yesterday is history; tomorrow's a mystery. Today's a gift - that's why they call it the present."
I remember reading a book by a German officer who was stationed in a nearby town and they all could smell "something" and nobody ever mentioned it because you don't know who is Gestapo. 
Yet still we have fuckers denying it
thank you. i take after my grandfather :-)
It also helps to prove the holocaust was real and as bad as historians and survivors say it was. This helps to fight against those who deny it or try to diminish the level of tragedy that it was. 
Check out the Shoah foundation, created by Spielberg to document survivors. 
I haven't been back since i was liberated. I think it's extremely important that these sites remain open and that people visit them. But even when you visit them, it's still difficult to comprehend what happened there and how humans are capable of such horror. 
They didn't put the regular soldiers to work in the concentration camps, only the zealots.
Hugely important why internal and external critical thinking is a skill everyone should learn; and also why nobody in power wants to teach it.
That's horrible to hear :(
Ever read the book "night"' by Elie Wiesel? Amazing read, but haunting nonetheless. While Mr. Flescher described his experience as "marching" Ellie describes it as "the marathon of death" Running through the snow, every time someone fell, they were killed.
If she went to Aushwitz with a young child odds are they were both killed right away. 
I'm just saying what would be at the top of my list. I'm sure this guy has his own list. 
Wow, I thought the fake showerhead thing was absolute fact. Thank you for the bit of enlightenment. 
I'd guess that it might be seen as smuggling an item that could be used in an escape attempt
I haven't had this yet, but keep in mind I am a pre service teacher, so  I haven't taught many classes yet!Some of the students I've had couldn't wrap their heads around it. I played them several videos of survivors talking about what they endured and some just couldn't fathom that people would do that sort of thing to other people. It does make kids sad to discuss it, some try to act macho but you can see it does upset them. 
is.... is this a common thing, to not teach about it? here in Canada we definitely covered it in depth when studying WW2.
Closed thing I've read & the one that truely kept me up for weeks afterwards was Zofia Nalkowska's Medallions. For those with a genuine interest, read this collection of short stories, Nalkowska collected the stories herself  to publicise the horrors that had occurred, the emotionless way in which she writes the stories left me shaken for weeks afterwards.
They think that all of the survivors are lying. That's literally their only argument, that everyone is lying. 
"Life is Beautiful" is the name of the movie.
Happy early birthday. I'm glad you were able to look past such horrors and live life to the fullest.
Hi! I`m a German man, my Grandpa(dad of my father) was a nazi war criminal an the other Grandpa was a Wehrmachts soldier and survivor of Stalingrad, My parents were war expellees. I hope since my youth things like this cruelties will never happen again. I cry for your experiences but also smile for all the good things you achieved after the war. Sincerely Rolf
He said he was born in March, 1924. D-Day was in June of 1944. Americans liberated the camps early 1945. He mentioned the date Buchenwald was liberated as his second birthday in April, 1945. He would have been 21.
It would have been April 11, 1945 when American troops liberated Buchenwald. He would have been a little over 21.
Sometimes they would take hoses and spray water onto the cars; people inside could drink what came through the slats. Based on the 6 day figure, they were at least doing this for them.
"The Grey Zone" articulates this part of the camp's use of prisoners for duties. Very gritty, gripping film. 
i went to auswitz many years ago with friends i met on my backpacking trip. it was amazing to see how people would be "excited" to come and see and, and even more interesting to see people leaving in complete silence with no one really talking at all and a bit of sadness or full blown tears
Can you tell the full story of how you met her? 
I do not feel guilt, if that's what you're asking.
I want to know what his brothers reaction was to discovering his brother was one of the very people he was rescuing...
Given the circumstances here, though, I can imagine that soldier might not have been very dismissive. It could be either way
Thanks Master Oogway
Noticeably, the Nazi's themselves never denied it after the war was over, only the Neo-Nazi's who had nothing to do with it deny it.
are you typing all the answers for him? Do you feel it's a miracle you're a alive since it was miraculous that your grandfather survived?Also thank you for doing this. 
The information that the archive groups have managed to catalogue and save is so important... I have so much respect for the amount of effort they have put into it.
I'm currently writing my dissertation on how museums (including USHMM) use the Internet and was taking a quick break from writing to read this AMA.  Their amazing reply makes this comment go full circle - it proves that the work they are doing reaches real people and new non-museum audiences AND it tells me to stop procrastinating on Reddit and finish the chapter that is due in the morning.  Well done /u/ushmmcurators and come visit us at /r/musuempros!
huh that's cool... in hebrew it means "a place and a name" and is a reference to a  passage in the book of jeremiah which states:  "Even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off"
Yeah, alot of people aren't aware of the differences between the SS and the Wehrmacht.
Adolf Eichmann, who was the guy who ran the logistics of putting people onto trains and sending them to the camps, was a strict 'do as you're told' kind of guy. He was told: find the most efficient way to send as many people as possible to the camps, so that's what he did. 
Also the lesser known Henry Oertelt has his audio book free on iTunes describes the constant "schneller schneller" (faster faster). 
She and her child were sent to Auschwitz. There's no coming back from there.
The fake showerheads existed, afaik, but they were just dummies mounted to the ceiling to make the lie of "just going there for a shower" more believable, not used to release gas.
My guess Is that the Nazis were cunts 
They believe they've caught onto some giant world-wide conspiracy, and everyone else is too dumb, or lazy, to see it.  Thus, they are the smart ones, above the rest of us, a intellectual leader among humanity.  If they were to admit they were wrong, they would have to reevaluate their status as one of the few truly intelligent humans.  This is one reason it's so hard to use logic and reason with these people - they don't believe you're as smart as they are, and they will do just about anything, latch onto any nonsensical arguments so they can keep believing that.
We should get a few thousand redditors to come back and wish Mr. Fletcher Happy Birthday on April 11. 
Jesus no shit, I'm drinking coffee and have tears in my eyes.
There is an example of this in Schindler's List. Schindler is telling the Germans to spray the cars while the German officers just sit and laugh at it. Unreal. 
Also, "Son of Saul", which was tremendous.
Both of my grandmas lived through the war, one of them lived in Warsaw and the war started on her first birthday, her early childhood was devastated by the war. My other grandma lived on a pretty large farm in the country side and she said she knew that a war was happening, she didn't know anything other than the Germans and the Russians were fighting over Poland. Shes told me she only saw soldiers a couple times. 
That would describe the average Wehrmacht soldier, but not the SS storm troopers.  The extermination camps were manned with SS and they knew exactly what they were doing.
I mean, let's just cut to the chase here.
Germany was falling apart at the time and they were told that cleansing the country would fix all their problems. They did what was supposed to help them. Its horribly tragic that it was so easy for many to just forget compassion and willingly degrade a group of people simply because they thought it would help.  
The actual word in Farsi is "Yad Bashem" (replacing the V). But from the area my parents come from (big area) the B is replaced with a V.Pretty interesting to hear the differences in languages.
Fewer tea and crumpets to soothe the soul, probably. 
As horrible as it must have been living through that for years, I'm curious to know if you have any good memories from that time? Did you laugh? Smile? Love?
I thought rubber came from a tree
>I was born in a log cabin I built with my own two hands.-- Michael Scott
This is terrifying. Think of how many people didn't know what was going on until it was right on top of them, or even how many people didn't know until the war was almost over?
No response as of yet. I'm taking that as a yes.
They were even taught it was necessary, otherwise the Jews would kill them in the end.
95% of the Jewish community in Lithuania was killed, often with the help of Lithuanians *Hilfswilliger* (volunteers), or even in spontaneous progroms. They still have trouble acknowledging their role in the Holocaust, they only talk about how much they suffered because of the soviets (which they undisputably did, maybe up to 500 000 Lithuanians died because of the stalinist repression).
I think you might be on to something here. 
I'm very intrigued by this.I now wonder the same
Yes but there's also synthetic rubber. Also rubber trees don't grow in Germany. Kinda need to make your own if you're going to war.
It goes beyond having trouble acknowledging their role. Nobody has ever been prosecuted, they permit anti-semitic content in "jokes" and news articles, and they don't take Jewish memorials seriously (mis-spellings and so on).
SS were his personal army, that he controlled. So yea.
Yeah there was basically zero mention of the political prisoners, homosexuals, Roma, etc. The entire thing was really offensive to me. That omission, plus the fact that the entire 4-chapter section was primarily devoted to military events; just a side-note on the Holocaust, and basically zero mention about *why* Hitler and the Nazis were able to rise to such power.
Also, there's a lot of evidence that some of the most zealous of the Nazi's were actually meth addicts (provided by the SS). It makes the actions of the most evil soldiers seem like the monstrous acts of meth addled minds.
To me, that last bit about how Hitler rose to power is the most critical, especially at present. If nothing else, kids should be taught to question any politician who appeals to the masses primarily by scapegoating others as the cause of all society's problems.
The Wehrmacht used meth in order to keep their tank crews alert during long operations. The US Air force and RAF still use a drug similar to meth for this same reason
For iOS pick up (1) book on learning Swift; (2) Big Nerd Ranch book on making "practice" apps with Swift. For Android pick up (1) book on learning Java; and (2) Big Nerd Ranch book on making "practice" apps with Java.With those four books, you should have a very strong foundation for getting out to sites like StackOverflow.com and advancing from there.
About four hours, seven days a week, for six months. Then I spent the next few months with programming as my basically full-time job, so I was pretty immersed from the get-go.
I've found that most people who say tabs think you mean actually using the space bar instead of the tab key lol. 
My mother birthed me as an investment in the goal of selling to Google.
Thank you. I'm very suspicious of new developers. I'm afraid they're incapable of working in larger collaboration.
Definitely StackOverflow. I haven't used Code Academy but have heard really good things about it. For me it was a few good books and a very large dose of SO.
This is a very tricky subject. Basically the issue was solved by letting the owner of the hockey team in on the software startup.
Strictly emails to marketing guys at college/pro sports teams. Literally, look the guy up, snoop for his email address, and send him a letter asking if he's interested. We finally started getting some traction as fans started sharing our videos, and this has made it more of a they-come-to-us instead of we-spam-them business model.
We didn't invest a single dollar. It was all contributions of time, way way too much free time.
Considering our initial investment was $0, the ROI has been infinite.
Economics degree from Northwestern. I have always been really introverted but had a love of learning, so I finished up high school and moved out at 16, and was probably very lucky that Northwestern chose to let me in at that age.
If I were you, and past that BNR point, I would just start coding projects and start looking to build a reputation or earn some additional income. Maybe look into freelance (some of those freelance mobile developers really rake it in) or try to build a reputation on GitHub. StackOverflow is the only resource material I've really needed following those first four books. There is just so much info on SO, if it goes down the internet is history.
And where will you keep them all up here in the Hollywood hills?
I am 23. If you ever feel like you can't do it, do what I do and head over to r/CrappyDesign. If some of those guys are professional programmers why can't I be?
Actually, not yet! Have received a lot of spam though.
Clemson has been the nicest team to work with. After publishing their app, they sent me a signed thank you card and a bobble head. Class act all the way.
It's definitely a full-time effort. I'd say learning to code was a hobby, but programming has been a job.
Yes, at the time there were no reputable books on Swift, so I learned Objective-C for iOS and Java for Android. I also picked up some basic PHP for backend server-side stuff.
Thanks, this is my absolute favorite thing to hear. Glad you enjoyed the product!
> I'm old now and I'd be competing with people who have done this for decades.The kid didn't know how to code 18 months ago.
I wish I made the NBA official app. I've made some apps for NBA teams, though. Some of this has been one-off apps, like the app we did for the Atlanta Hawks last year, and others have been integrated into the team's official app in SDK format, like we did for the NHL Florida Panthers last season as well.
All the bureaucracy and contracts. Seriously, screw that I just want to code.
Having them scan their ticket's barcode may be easier.
This is a great idea. Two other finely timecoded sources of data would do it. No scanning of tickets. No entering of section numbers. Surprisingly precise. See a device called a "pc notes taker" that does this to capture handwriting. 
Which swift book did you use?
cool. any tips on staying motivated and getting disciplined?
Unfortunately, it's probably *because* you've been coding so long
What? How is this possible? Do you indent with enter or esc? And the people who say esc actually mean enter? This is driving me insane, how is this possible?!?! What do you mean?!?!
I bet she can't wait for the shares to split
Any suggestions on how to take amateur coding to the next level by being prepared for collaboration
What is SO? Can someone explain?
That is interesting. I'm glad it worked out for you. That's not a bad person to have on your side in the end. I think people should be aware that this can become an issue if they have industry specific developments they come up with and decide they want to strike out on their own. 
>We finally started getting some traction as fans started sharing our videos,That's exactly how I heard about it for Purdue. A buddy sent me a video of it when he was at a game.Have you looked into getting it into an Olympic opening ceremony? That would be huge.
How did you pay the bills while you were learning / coding for 18 months?
Well you had to buy the books...
You started undergrad at 16 years old?
Like you I had ideas and issues which I solved. Any tips on discovering cool libraries to work with? or Apis? Stack is so huge, how do you find out whats "hot"?
Cool. Similar age. I have been wanting to improve my programming skills for some while. You have motivated me, at least for a while.
Congratulations, word of advice. If you get stuck, start a timer. Try solve your problem, if you haven't gotten anywhere in 15 minutes, stop and ask for help. Don't worry about asking for help and don't get sucked in to wasting too much time trying to solve it yourself. 
The jargon is strong with this one.
That's great to hear. I'm glad that you had a good experience with us. What app were you involved with? Go tigers!
So you didn't tek da pletch? 
Yes, someone actually mentioned that to me last month and it's definitely something we should implement.
> No scanning of tickets. No entering of section numbers.That's what I would try to avoid as well.  Anything that requires user input will almost certainly degrade the result.  I'm really interested in this triangulation suggestion as well.  Certainly cheaper than a phased array!
At the time when I was picking up iOS programming, there were few good Swift books, so I learned Obj-C instead. It was good in that there was so much more open-source software written in Obj-C than Swift, which helped me through my early stages. A lot of my code is still written in Obj-C, it's actually my favorite language (likely because it was the first I learned), and I'll miss it.
You need a baseline of knowledge so you can know what to search for to figure out the solution to your problem.
Been doing it for 7 years now and "It worked the first time" is still a surprise.
Same, man.  When I'm about to learn something new, I waste way too much time wondering if it's...well, a waste of time.I had some free time a month ago and I was thinking about learning some new stuff, but there's an ocean out there to sail and I couldn't decide where I wanted to go.  Grails? Django? Scala?Couldn't decide, ended up just tinkering with my rasp pi and beefing up on my Spring skills.
Not impossible, just a pain in the ass. I see no real reason to learn to code iOS in swift / obj-c first if you don't have a mac. There's a lot to be learned just doing anything with whatever you have. Even starting a file out and making a super simple HTML page on your desktop and then adding a javascript file and hooking things up can get you started down the path of learning.
As long as you have some inclination towards logic (i.e. your lack of math skills is just due to lack of education) then you should be able to create pretty much any kind of code except advanced scientific simulations. There isn't all that much actual math involved in most software development.On the other hand, if you already at an early age decided that math was impossible and never developed your analytical skills, you might struggle with any sort of coding. It's all about thinking logically and thinking in systems of symbols, and maths is great practice in doing exactly this. 
For me, it's always just been a lot of pressure I put on myself. I want to succeed so that this pressure will finally go away. Me_irl.
Why is this? 
I have! I need to continue with that. I've done game development but without a huge amount of startup capital it would take a while to make a Kickstarter prototype that I'd be proud of so I've been more focusing on the job hunt. 
Why would anyone use anything else. It's easier to just press one button, but spaces just work more predictably than tabulations. So it's the best of both worlds.
I'm pretty sure the the meaning of the comment is supposed to be:I've found that most people who say they indent with tabs believe that "indenting with spaces" means you indent by pressing the space bar multiple times, instead of the tab key once.
My background was economics.
They already have first-party code that does this. They use ultrasonic frequencies to pair the Chromecast.OP's idea is not so original.
Who's a good boy?!
Fortunately since growing quite a bit this past year we've had our software reviewed -- security is definitely a priority.
Learn about good code practices and design patterns :) Always have an open mind and ask for code reviews to other senior programmers. That is going to help a lot in getting better and better
StackOverflow
Yup, people should look at their employment contract before doing **any work** on personal projects during work hours. Many companies write in that anything created on company time (or on company property) belongs to the company.
Awesome to come across someone who's heard of my work! Yes, I've thought (dreamed) about doing something with the Olympics but easier said than done. We have recently gotten into some other continents though, such as for Cricket in Australia and we plan to work with some Soccer teams in Europe as well.
Doing econometrics for the hockey team. It was a place where, say I finished my work at 1 PM, I could spent from 1 to 5 PM studying how to code. 
Daily is probably the easiest. For the first six months after I picked up my first programming book, I put in about four hours a day. Then I started actually working on apps. At first these were minor league apps for hockey teams, and they kinda sucked. But it helped me improve to the point where I could pretend to hang with the big boys. Classic tale of fake it till you make it.
You're right. That lowers our ROI from infinity to around 3.50%.
16 and a half
I love to browse GitHub. I typically do keyword searches, but they have trending pages as well.
Any chance you could provide a link so I make sure I get the right one? I have always wanted to learn programming, but run into the issue of starting then kind of feeling like I can't do it and stopping then coming back to it later. I really want to dedicate myself to it this year and try to produce some cheesy app by the end of 2017 and go from there. Thank you.
No prior knowledge whatsoever. Learning Obj-C was my first introduction. 
Probably improving your general knowledge in one programming language is better before you dive into platform specific stuff.
He's payed by the books!
The Clemson light show, which is packaged into the Clemson Rewards app, I believe. 
If you can create point sources of sound, you could simply use phasing between ultrasonic frequencies to control sweeps, with the added advantage that you don't need any detailed knowledge of physical layout.
Hi, I also self-taught myself objective-c back in the day (coming from non-programmer background), do yourself a favor and learn Swift. I thought I loved Obj-C as well but after Swift, looking at Obj-C code makes me puke a little.Your idea is spectacular but your execution is even better, best of luck in the future!
I'm glad this is getting upvotes. It is a very important point and it's a problem that I experienced when I began to program. So many answers are available through StackOverflow, but only if you have the vocabulary/understanding enough to know what to ask (or search for) and how to ask (or search).
And if not, or there is an old solution that isn't working/you don't understand because the application is slightly different, I've always had a ton of success asking questions as well
Then ask your own question, and in your question clearly state what you don't understand, what you *do* understand, and what you have tried. But remember that it is for specific Q/A, not a tutorial.Stackoverflow is very much effort in/effort out.
"I wrote a code and it came up with a bunch of errors. I wonder what's wrong.""I wrote a code that worked the first time. I wonder what's wrong?"
Tape the options onto a D(n) and roll with it?
Thank you. I probably need to see what sort of studying I can do on my own. I might try going through some Khan Academy math courses. 
Thank you for the info.
You succeeded. Literally not /r/me_irl
They assume that free mountain dew and pizza won't be enough to compensate him for 18 hours days...
If tabs don't work predictably, you haven't trained your editor very well.
Two spaces is the guideline in Ruby and Elixir. 
Many (non-PhD) economists I know have a bit of trouble when it comes to Fourier analysis, transforms, DSP. So I'm gonna assume you're just a smart guy who's good at math.
It's the brand and contract agreements that protects OP's product.An MIT license is probably better if you want anyone to see how useful your programming is.
Come on now, throw him a bone
Yes. It's part of Android's "nearby" system. But it should not do it if they are both on the same wifi though. Try disabling the guest feature too.
It does actually (it's google's *nearby* api):"Nearby uses a combination of Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi and **near-ultrasonic audio** to communicate a unique-in-time pairing code between devices."
I recommend reading a book called "Clean Code", it helped me a lot. It's impossible to work with people that have different coding practices, and this book introduces you to everything you need to know.
Just wanted to say that your comment about his comment was very formal and appropriate.
My thoughts exactly. 
Any suggestions on where/how to learn those?
Serious question: Can't you just lie? Pretend that you created on your own time and/or said you produced it prior to working with said employer?
It is such a cool idea. I wondered how it worked when I saw it; the sound thing never occurred to me.
This was the answer I was looking for to my unasked question: "How smart is this guy to learn code on his own?"After doing econometrics in school, I imagine code wouldn't be that bad.
Four hours, wow. Thanks!
God damn Loch Ness monster!
Hollywood Lamborghini's on my bookshelves in the hills
He also said he had a background in economics
Okay, not knocking your story of success whatsoever. It just sounds to me like you had the intelligence and maturity of an adult in your teens...so while I agree that hard work and dedication helps a lot..your brain is an XBOX 7 while I'm working with a PS2 upstairs. My overall point: you got the gift, kid.
Thanks! I mean had you ever even used a terminal before that?
But what's more important than all these cars up here in the Hollywood hills is knowledge. That's why I got these 47 bookcases to fill. Because the more you learn, the more you earn. 
Seems like your an autodidact. 
I used derivatives for the first time last week and I've been programming for 10 years
Remind me to do an AMA next time I need to create a product/come up with an idea. The responses in here are brilliant.
Scanning the ticket might be better than trusting 20k people to put in their info correctly.
Ay you're a wavy ass dude, you know that?
I used to think I was pretty language agnostic. But now I know Python gives me a hard-on.
beyond that, you have to start with something; they'll flat-out refuse to answer "how to" questions, it has to be at least "this is what I've done; help me from here"
Second one is so much more concerning. It worked the first time... something truly terrible must be happening in the background. 
Actually not a bad idea, but now you're tempting me to come up with like 20 options
Keenan and Kel were amazing. WELCOME TO GOOD BURGER, HOME OF THE GOOD BURGER.
Cost to develop an ios app: $2000 + $100/year for xcodeI never even thought about how expensive that is to be forced into buying all their hardware
I find that the math isn't what gets me. Math in school is usually a lot like writing a perfect program without any compiler errors... with a pencil and paper and no access to a compiler.99% of my errors could be alleviated by looking up the rule I need (like going on StackExchange) or they are simple arithmetic errors (like I slipped and used = instead of ==.)
Boolean algebra may sound scary, but there is a good chance you already understand it, just without all the formalities of a class.  If you understand the meaning of the words 'and', 'or', and 'not', you're half way there.  Basically, Boolean algebra is just the algebra or logic of making decisions.  Don't let the name scare you.
Design plays a large roll in it, which I am not that good at. Thankfully there are some tools like Materialize.CSS or Bootstrap that can help you get off the ground with something that doesn't look like it was inside a cow 3 days ago.The important part is learning the hows and why's of the thing, not focusing on making it look good.

First day: It's getting late now, I will do my 4 hours tomorrowSecond day: I should start any minute now...Third day: Why learn programming when I can learn Mandarin?
 > I do this to myself but unfortunately apply this pressure to nothing.    I had something simular. Except for the obvious advice never stop trying i can't say much. When I failed a grade it "clicked" somehow and I started to work a lot more. Currently learning Japanese in my free time and planning to learn to code in a couple months.
There's also sometimes a belief that coding is a young man's game. Grandpa here will be behind on the latest ways of doing things, set in his old ways, old languages etc etcIt's true of some people and not of others but there's often a bit of a bias like this. 
*glares at notepad*
Dude...He used a 3 instead of an e in his name. Should have been a tip off, ya big dumb aminal.
In which case, this AMA is a thinly veiled advertisement (and the "releasing for free under MIT" thing is dishonest).
No, but they invented PageRank, and that's what's important. 
Awesome, thanks for the information! I wonder if my chromecast is secretly driving my cat crazy.
I second the recommendation; love that book.
Not necessarily. People are picking out the stuff that is easy to pick out as wrong. No one here is spending time understanding the business logic. We don't necessarily know the requirements or the domain well enough to do a code review on those aspects of the code. 
The song needs to contain one of our ultrasonic fingerprints, which is what the app is actually listening for. So yes, we can sync with any song but only after the song is edited!
Well in any programming discussion there are the following groups:*  Non programmers*  Hobbyists*  Easy going 'whatever works' guys*  See programming as an art form that should be respected guysAll have different goals and different standards and will disagree.
Well those were the two most pleasant and sensible comments to be be uttered in the entire history of the internet. 
Return to your old code from a year ago. If it still does make sense it will make sense to others. Usually you will find that your old code sucks but that's OK because it means you are smarter than used to be.
You could, untill said employer brings you to court.
Honestly, as someone who hadn't done a line of code when I started my course on it, as long as you've got a decent understanding of algebra and logic in combination with decent googling skills, you'll be fine. Occasionally frustrated because you lack the terminology to find what you want, but fine. 
If you want to get really good at something, really fast, that sounds about right.Putting in 1500 hours in a single year (~4 hours a day for 365) is about equivalent to all the coursework in an entire undergraduate degree.
Don't forget Warren Buffet. 
Been coding for two years. still unemployed. read this post. jump off bridge ~s
I admire your honesty.
What's that?
Can I ask what you used it for or how? I've always wondered what type of projects you would use calc in.
do an AMA next time you need to create a product/come up with an idea
That requires everybody to keep track of their ticket, not swap seats, and have proper lighting for ticket scanning.  Getting people to enter in data in any way is a deceptively difficult problem to solve.  Some 3D audio positioning may be the best solution.
I'm aware of that.  Keep in mind they're done while the lights are off which maximizes the impact of a single screen.  The videos would still have to be tailored to account for low resolution and/or missing people.  Think waves of colors, moving lines, checkerboards, etc.I anticipate you could have about the same impact as those Christmas Light videos.
Max B is that you???
Are you serious? I just told you a moment ago.
This is a good lesson for the workplace as well. I try to never ask a question without a solid base of "I tried this solution and it resulted in this error, so I tried doing this and I'm unsure of where to go from here." Flat out saying "how do I do this?" or "this doesn't work." isn't very professional and doesn't get great results. 
This sounds just like how my first aid training started a few weeks ago:One person is lying there screaming in agony. One person is lying there silent. The silent one is much more worrying and is almost always the one you should investigate first.
Write a program that will tell you what the next language you should learn is.
Thank you. 
Thats awesome man, good luck with the Japanese. Yea when I was in college i never applied it to my studies. I got my grades and did what i had to do but it never felt fun - only like i was going through the motions. The "just keep trying new things" advice is all i got. I have a couple passionate hobbies that im trying to apply these feelings towards in ambitions of turning them profitable and monetizing them. Thanks for the message and words of encouragement.
Pretty sure that's what every single AMA is though. 
If by invented you mean took existing work, elaborated on it, and collaborated with other researchers, then sure, they "invented" PageRank. They didn't do it from thin air though.
Just wanted to say that your comment is abnormally and refreshingly legible though somewhat hyperbolic.
Your Google-fu definitely needs to be strong.
Totally. Four hours is about what anyone who's trying to get good at things put in. Professional trumpet players tend to practice for four hours a day, professional bodybuilders work out for four hours a day, professional writers write productively for four hours a day. Past that, most people don't have the concentration to accomplish much (or the endurance for physical activities).
I think he's hitting on you.
Just like the other person said, in neural networks.  Your activation function needs to be a differentiable function (commonly a sigmoid) in order to determine the backpropagated error signal (which requires a gradient of the activation function).
Damn, you're good at this. Remind me to create a product/come up with an idea
Free Max B
You just gave me a mental image of a compiler screaming every time it hit an error.  That would be terrifying.
But what language to write that program in?
It was my first language (other than messing around I'm visual basic), and I honestly don't see it being any more difficult to start with than Java. Sure, you won't necessarily make use of the object oriented features right away, but they will be there when you need them.
Cmon man let's keep this about Rampart.
I just wanted to say hi. Hi. 
yup. Figured the 1/0 as a floating point was positive infinity my sophomore year of college because I fucked up some code haha
Just because you are good at something does not mean you like it.
lol this sounds funny. Can you ELI5 what this means?
Please create a product and/or come up with an idea for one.
I know my next project..
In Brainfuck, of course.
It's certainly possible for it to be a first language, but IMHO there will be just enough added complexity above an interpreted language to cause "give up" levels of frustration for people with no coding and very little math experience. 
Damn... reddit we are so good at reminding people about coming up with ideas. If only there were a way to come up with good ideas. Oh well I'll think of one later.
Please use the Wilhelm scream :D
reddit has a lot of cash. Monetization isn't a short-term concern of ours. Yes, we will continue to experiment with different efforts so that when time is right we know what works and what does not.
The first time I was asked was way back when Yishan left. At the time I was too focused on Hipmunk to seriously consider it. Since then, Hipmunk has grown into a really nice, stable company-- we've hired very well-- and they can move forward without my complete attention (I will still be acting as CTO for the time being).The past week was super hectic. A week ago, I didn't know I would be here!
Which admin?
Really good question, thank you.I think the new user / core user dichotomy is the biggest product challenge we fact right now. Solve it, and we are unstoppable. A vague answer, I know, but this is one of the big things on my mind.
I have lots of ideas! But, I'm sad to say, I don't want to publicize them here until I've got more support internally. It's shitty if you're on a product/dev team to come into work and find everything's been upended without any of your input.
Don't forget to crosspost with /r/cannibals. Similar audiences.
Would be about as effective...
Follow up on this one, isn't that policy just a way to avoid people appealing bans? If they don't know they were banned or why, how can they complain? Even 4chan at its banniest told you you were banned and why.
We will reconsider all our policies from first principles. I don't know all of the changes that were made under Ellen's tenure. I'm mostly still getting to know everyone here.No, Ellen was not used as a scapegoat. She stepped up during a time of crisis for reddit, for which we were thankful. Things didn't go smoothly, for sure, but I will do my best to guide us forward.
Too soon to tell. I've only got to meet the team for the first time late in the afternoon, and I still haven't had a chance to meet everyone, let alone have substantive discussions.The vibe around the office is pretty fun, but the reddit team has been through a lot the past while. I hope I can bring some stability.
My father was an engineer at GM for 30 years.My step-father was a heavy hitter in the business world for a while, most publicly he was the CMO of Unisys, but that place is a cluster, so he left.
It's going to take a little time to find the right balance. Hipmunk is in a stable place, and most of my value is provided in a few key meetings every week, which I will still be attending. Also, they're five blocks away, so I can go over there whenever I need.
For those not aware, /r/AMD was closed down by the top mod abruptly without any warning. This forced users of that subreddit to move to /r/AdvancedMicroDevices.As for a potential answer if spez doesn't reply....reddit hasn't intervened in subreddit's closing down and such when a mod does it on their own. If the AMD mod had done something fishy then it could be opened (like /r/wow was).
/u/spez was his second choice behind /u/kn0thing , he was just so sad that he missed that username.
Is Reddit Gifts gone? I'm pretty sure it is not, and we have no plans to shut it down.As for Dan, I didn't work with him, and really don't know much of that situation.
reddit had better technology than Digg. I don't think Voat has better technology than reddit.
> Please don't do them weekly. Maybe monthly or bi-monthly.Ok, you're the boss, Xephryon.> Do you have some way to automatically track vote brigades and people taking part in them?Yeah, we do. It's existed for a long time. Maybe it broke after I left. We used to put a lot of effort into identifying large groups of people who were trying to undermine the community.
No. I know she was well-loved by many moderators, and I'm very sorry at how everything played out. It could have been handled much better.However, she was let go for specific reasons, which I obviously will not share, and we will stand by that decision.What we will absolutely do is make sure we have dedicate people internally to help manage the relationships between moderators and guests on reddit. I'm still getting to know everyone here, and I expect this will be an ongoing conversation between you all and I.
I think we need more official Reddit Android Developers.
Yes, we have an amazing opportunity to change the world.No, I just didn't want to look stupid in front of my parents.

1000 duck sized horses. Since they can't climb stairs, you can easily get away from them long enough to figure out how to drown them.
Monetization through the "Gold" program was fantastically handled.  Reddit was upfront with the community from the start with what they were doing and why they were doing it.  Feedback was openly welcome and was effective because the users were wholly included at the start of the process.  I think for future efforts to be successful you'd do well to repeat this strategy.  The last thing Redditors will accept is that feeling like someone's trying to cash them out without their knowledge.
That didn't seem to be a very direct answer...but..I can understand where you are coming from.Reddit needs more CMs, or better tools for those CMs :(
/u/pinwhale He was gonna help us with so much, then he disappeared 
Probably the default subredit you are subscribed from your region. For example if I enter reddit with an IP from Chile (no user), I get /r/chile on the front page. I asume is the same for other countries/states
Hey spez,Have you thought about modifying the new user on-boarding experience? Right now everyone is just given a list of default subs, but I think it may work better (and help promote the varied nature of the site) to introduce people to subreddits that correlate with their interests while they sign up. I want to say I've seen Tumblr and other sites try to do this.Food for thought.
Would this also translate to Reddit Is Fun for us Android people?
Actual Cannibal Steven LaHuff
Can't we just look at his post history...?
I'm not sure how I can provide more proof other than marking it as admin.
She can't surely have been solely responsible for all the negatively perceived changes?
He said Victoria was fired for specific reason but can't tell what it was. Now, I am wondering. 
I hope so, too.  Welcome back.  
That explains the tie to Flint, MI. Glad you made it out.
I like that a CEO is now taking on two jobs and walking to each office between shifts. You're kind of a model for the country.
Thinking in realtime: we probably don't want to undo a mod's decision, but if they leave forever, we can re-claim it.
Its pretty low to take someones idea, incorporate him and the idea into your system, then fire the guy who came up with the idea.  Makes a lot of redditors not want to help you folks out.
Shots fired.
So nerd question: was Reddit originally in lisp? What led to that decision, or was it just what the original people knew?
You said elsewhere you're against shadowbanning of real users. Given that brigading is currently mostly countered by shadowbans, how do you plan to punish them instead?
I love all of the reddit Android apps out there right now, but yeah. It would be nice to have an official one too. Please just don't remove the ability for 3rd party reddit apps to exist on any platform. Competition is good!
This is great news. /r/undelete kind of functions this way right now. But it'd be great to have some built in reddit functionality for this kind of thing. 
I'd say you've done a pretty good job of not looking stupid.
Toby is the worst.
You should come to one of our Annex Events. Tuesday is Improv. Thursday is the urban foraging club. I'll add you to the annex newsletter for updates on events and more!
We welcome all, as long as you're fast enough.
Whoa Whoa Whoa. Slow your roll, Drew. While I think 5th World Lounge is one of the hottest spots in town, I think it's only proper that he visits the ORIGINAL hot spot in town, The Annex, first.I hope we can resolve these issues and possibly co-market our corners of the office soon?
I have a feeling the question has been finally answered.
"Don't ever, ever try to lie to the internet - because they will catch you. They will de-construct your spin. They will remember everything you ever say for eternity."-- Gaben
Honestly, I'm not sure how much of an answer to questions like this he can give until he figures out his relationship with everyone at the company and exactly what's going on. It's his first full day on the job. Luckily, he said he's gonna be doing these AMAs weekly or so. I'd ask again in a couple weeks.Also, happy cake day!
Stalling isn't the right word, but of course the board wants to see growth. I want to see growth too. We're not going to see much growth without serious product efforts, and we're not going to get serious product efforts without more resources. Fortunately, I have the ability to get those resources, so that's what I'll do.
What was he going to help with?
I strongly prefer Sync myself. It's got full, beautiful, material design, a terrific dev team who stays active on the sync sub, and embedded image viewing.
Ahh! Your karma! It's caught in a bear trap!
Can you subscribe to a user so that his or her posts will show up on your frontpage?  I figured that would be the rationale.
Reserve your 'liking him' for when he actually accomplishes change.
Only option now is to ban automoderator.
It's hard to imagine she was, but responsibility flows up. I'm sure there will be times I've got to take it on the chin as well. Part of the gig.
I don't think you realise that either her or anyone on reddit spilling the beans is going to end up in a legal shitstorm or a situation that leaves them unemployable.
America! Where chasing the American dream means even CEOs have a second job!
Similarly to how /r/redditrequest works?
IIRC wasn't it just given to karmanaut?
His wife /u/5days who co-founded it is still an admin and has said she will keep running it.
Hey, if someone has a chance of being gifted a new car, I'm all for it. 
No, Pao fired.
Yes, Reddit was originally written in Lisp. I don't remember what was said about it at the time, but I think it's fair to assume that Paul Graham's involvement (through Y Combinator) with Reddit early on played a role in that decision. 
Undermine them with technology, of course.
Or /r/bestof or /r/subredditdrama etc.Maybe get some kind of better way to disable voting than np. Np is basically a CSS hack yet we all need to respect it because we risk being shadowbanned.
I support this as long as they hire you and don't ruin it like Alien Blue.Sent from Sync for reddit Pro.
Toby works in HR which is corporate so he's not apart of our family, he's also divorced so he's not part of that family either
> urban foraging clubIs that a euphemism for dumpster diving? Is the pay that bad? Blink an SOS if you need help.

...but the fifth world lounge is a shared space and the annex is not! Also, the shrine includes a bear head bottle opener. The annex doesn't have one of those.

Gnawing off your karma! (Quiet! Quiet!)
That sounds clever until you realize it would just enable stalking.
I say nopah!
There was the guy who posted on TIFU about being shadowbanned for THREE YEARS.
I just found out today that my main, which I have had for nearly 4 years, which has a few Reddit Regifter trophies and I have bought gold on, has been shadow banned for I don't know how long, I just thought my comments where not popular...If I had done or said something wrong it would have been less hurtful to be told so that I could either explain or know what I should be doing better...
To *shadow*ban Automoderator!
Nah let's just get u/chooter to veri.... Oh wait
Or themselves sleeping and holding a piece of paper
>  but responsibility flows upThis is very true. My boss reminds me of this all the time. He always says "if you fuck up, I am the one that takes the fall as I am in charge. So do a good job" lOL
I am a lawyer, and it's not just a legal shit storm at issue when speaking negatively about a former employee. It's also a moral issue. Unless the former employee stole from the company or otherwise was patently deceptive, it's just cruel to spread gossip about them. You don't need to fuck up someone's future employment prospects just to make yourself look better in the business breakup. 
Rent in San Francisco is just really expensive.
Yeah, there was a lot of drama/story. tl;dr - The guy who created it, didn't like the direction it was headed and shut it, then I think he got doxxed at work and reddit negotiated with him, karmanaut stepped up and reopened/took ownership.
Wait they fired him but not his wife? Holy shit... way to make the home life awkward...
I'm mostly in agreement with you but in this case, I believe, he was Santa before reddit hired him.
*golf clap*
I like the sound of that. I hope your negotiations with Acme Corp are going well.
Not anymore apparently, now we just get hard banned. Yaaaay. It's all better than being thrown to the same punishment as spam bots though.
Whats stopping the admins from firing the mods of the huge subbreddits and replacing them with people that will toe the company line?
And if we aren't told the truth, we will fabricate our own truth.
Or that Jesse Jackson's AMA brought about some sort of frivolous lawsuit threat.I think we're down to 3 theories? - A disastrous AMA- Something about moving/not moving to San Francisco- turning AMA into a major scripted revenue source
Yes, he was spamming long comments and modmails (mostly in Chinese iirc) about Ellen Pao
A quick glance at your comments shows that you've been dealing with this a lot lately. Hope people get their goldfish straight soon! 
I've got 99 problems and Toby Flenderson is every single one. 
No, man. Urban foraging is like rural foraging, but instead of rural bushes they go after urban bushes like George and Jeb.
This is like watching parents fight for weekend visitation rights\*grabs popcorn*
I did not say that! 
Bold move if you ask me. "professional redditor" doesn't help on my resume ;(
If he doesn't answer this one, can you explain what that is?
Great point!
I found a lot of subreddits that I'm subscribed to by hitting the Random button. I think having a better way to find them would be cool - maybe a short questionnaire when you sign up or to make a few suggestions from time to time.
Deleting all your comments! (Quiet! Quiet!)
You can add friends, which effectively dues this. Doesn't front page it, but enabled the stalking tool.Whatever happened to RSS feeds?
That was one of the most depressing things i have read, he kept at it for 3 years with not a single upvote... He was running on nothing but hopes and dreams. all we want in life is to feel validated, he was robbed of that in the form of shadowbanhammer
Also, when an account is shadowbanned their old posts are sent to the spam queue on subs. A mod can re approve all their old content.
> I just thought my comments where not popular...All the feels. My main was shadowbanned and to this day I still don't know why. Tried emailing mods asking what I did and how can I change but never heard back. Had to abandon it and start over...really soured me from reddit.What kills me is I have been a mod on a different tech site for 12 years (honestly) and never would have done something like this. We had issues with anon posters but usually we solved it by required photographic proof (home improvement forum) which usually worked.
Eh, I'm pretty conservative about [A]-ing, because I think it can get obnoxious (also, it literally sends a ping to our office-wide chat room). But point taken in this case.
If you do that, the site will go down. Automod is literally skynet. 
Automod is the real CEO
This is [m]y first ceo ama. Be gentle.;)
"But I'll also fire you".
I don't know about that. She brought the community together like no one else has.
Hot young CEOs in your area right now!
He could have been fired for anything from "here look mate we heard about the new job, you're fired, enjoy the severance" to "dude you just can't do that with a chicken in public".
I say we use the old paint a tunnel into the side of a cliff trick.
That's true.On the other hand with a technological solution you don't necessarily even need rules. I assume the technological solution will be to detect when a brigading is happening and cancel out all the downvotes/upvotes. As such, I don't even need to know whether what I'm doing counts as brigading, I'll just do what I do and if the system decides to cancel out my vote then, oh well, I've wasted half a second. 
Technically? Nothing. But, an adversarial relationship with the mods is the opposite of what we want.
Actually, it's down to 1 theory.* Completely baseless speculation
Popcorn Tastes good
Admins nerding it up.
I mod over at /r/DarkNetMarkets and I really hope that subreddit never gets on the chopping block. It's a valuable tool for harm reduction and education on proper use of those marketplaces. We simply strive to provide an educational resource for people who are interested in learning about the DarkNet and how to stay safe while using them. I recognize our subreddit walks a fine line in regards to legality, but I really hope that if it comes down to it, the admins would work with us on what changes to make to keep us around rather than just shutting us down. 
>However, I wouldn't be happy if they made RES a premium that you have to pay for.They couldn't. Well, they could remove RES itself, but clones would pop up. And they can't really block things like this on the client, since they don't control your computer. They can make it difficult: e.g. if they changed the ways that the HTML was laid out, it would mess with how RES changed content on reddit.
It was an idea that there's a segment of possible employees (women, minorities) who are less likely to negotiate (and are scrutinized when they do) and as a result, people who do know how to negotiate (mainly white men) get an unfair advantage. Reddit went through a process of establishing a process for determining fair pay given job title, experience level etc and would make what it considered a fair offer and would not budge from that fair offer. 
Before this comment, I thought geodefault was geode fault. Like a fault for earthquakes, but filled with geodes..
Something like what stumbleupon does would be great. You make a user name, check the boxes of interesting things you like including boobies and wieners and then you get subreddit recommendations based off your interests. 
Now you're at /r/cannibals, sitting inside Steven LaHuff! 
Does friending only work if it's mutual?
That's disgusting. You are a terrible person. You can't mix dog AND cat meat. It's one or the other, you monster. 
Haha, for the last many years the response from these "other" admins was a nicer worded "go fuck yourself" on just about any topic. I hope spez can see through the bullshit and kicks their asses in gear but some of them **kough kough** have been at their bullshit for years.
It was because he triggered the automated system to shadowban spammers. His very first act on the site was to post the same link to two different subreddits at seconds apart.
No, you aren't shadowbanned.
Yeah, but none of the default mods care to waste time on that. Happens plenty on the recent subs that have grown and been created in response to recent changes, though. 
Shadow Banning someone is particularly cruel, seeing as they will go on posting/commenting without knowing they are wasting there time, I hope Reddit really does intend on changing things for the better
Right-click on your name in the top-right corner and click on "open link in new incognito window". If it shows up properly, you're fine, if it shows an error or doesn't show up, you've got an issue. 
> also, it literally sends a ping to our office-wide chat roomneat
"I'm sorry /u/spez, I can't let you do that"
Out of a cannon into the sun.    Edit- Thank you for the gold!
Seriously, the announcement last night was the least divisive one they've ever made.
Please feel free to lurk /r/portland if you think this is an inaccurate assessment. 
You can't have it!
I read his comments and like Victoria he did not seem to know why he was fired. **Edit** Also he did not seem like a chicken fucker though you can rarely tell just through text communication. 
Mods who toe the company line have a name at Facebook and Twitter--employees. Reddit benefits from a big team of volunteers who want little in return.
Nah. I was in the area and asked if they had time for me to come visit. 
Guys Victoria had a backpack I think she's the boston bomber
My issue with the entire Victoria boondoggle is this: there should never be only one person responsible for the largest feature on a website like this. At the minimum, there should have been one other person able to step in and take over immediately when Victoria was let go. As amazing as she was at her job, you can't hand the keys to the kingdom to a single employee and expect nothing to ever go wrong.
It's so cute. I haven't seen this many admins in a thread...ever..and all in good spirits. I've been here about four years. It's kind of uplifting. Maybe the Reddit staff is about to unite and kick some serious ass.One can only hope..
Yes. Our currency is highly valuable and accepted internationally (in the Annex).
erowid.org was a lifesaver when I was in college.Same principle.
There is no such thing as "no negotiation". There is only "how badly do we want to keep this employee"? If an employee is critical enough, they'll negotiate. In this hot job market for engineers, they'd be stupid not to.
Weird thing is the only countries excluded are the UK and Russia.Also, TIL about geode rocks :)

We had a really good laugh when we found out that Mossack Fonseca addressed some of his very secretive clients by code names like "Winnie Pooh" or "Harry Potter". Sth like that: *"I refer to a meeting with Harry Potter"*Hilarious! 
Of course we were and still are worried. But we know that Germany is a pretty safe country for journalists. We are more concerned about our colleagues in other regions of the world, like Russia, Africa, Latin America...
We think the most important stories of the leak got the attention they deserved. At least as far as we can see. But of course we can't overlook all the published stories in nearly 80 countries. Do you think there is a story that the media should have reported more on? 
> How did you decide which other news organisations to work with on the story?It took us quite some time to decide on that and we made these decisions together with the ICIJ. To trust the partners was extremely important for us. Thats why ICIJ firstly contacted partners we had already worked with. It was less important for us how big the news outlet is. What mattered more was their expertise, their willingness to cooperate and their awareness for security issues. We also tried to have journalists from a lot of different countries on our team to make this a global project. 
We tried to be vague. And we tried to make our work sound as boring as possible, so that no one wants to ask anymore questions. It worked most of the time. 
> Also, how deep is Lionel Messi in trouble?There is already a court case against Messi. The hearing was postponed after the Panama Papers got published because we found another shell company that Messi was involved in. So the prosecutor is going to look into that. So Messi was in trouble even before the PP, but the new revelations definitely didnt help him. But of course we dont know what the official prosecutors are going to decide. 
> As investigative journalists, is there data or information that you do not understand, and require knowledge of basic finance in order to sort through the Panama Papers?Of course we didnt unterstand everything at first sight. But whenever we struggled with certain details we contacted external experts, f.e. for money laundering, tax planning or sanctions. 
We were thrilled and skeptical at the same time. But we were able to verify the parts of the data we reported on through various sources, f.e. court documents, public registries, former leaks and in the end also interviews. 
We don't have a clue. But as a former NSA-employer, Snowden certainly has his methods. ;) 
It started with just the two of us, Bastian and Frederik. In May 2015 we were around 40 people worldwide and at the end of the year almost 400 people. And these were only the people who worked with the data itself. Each news outlet had a lot more staff that was working on different aspects of the story - like design, publishing or reporting on the ground, researching different aspects. *(Bastian and Frederik)*
Happy cake day!And no, we are not really worried about our future careers. Is there any reason we should? Is there anything we don't know??? If yes, please tell us!
On The Media has a good episode about the Panama Paper which also explained this.
We dont want to speculate. But obviously the source wanted the data to be handled by journalists. 
> We are not going to release the raw data and we have valid reasons to do so. The source decided to give the data to journalists and not, f.e., to Wikileaks. As journalists, we have to protect our source: We cant guarantee that there is no way for someone to find out who the source is with the data. Thats why we cant make the data public.> And as responsible journalists we also stick to certain ethical rules: You dont harm the privacy of people, who are not in the public eye. Blacking out private data is a task, that would require a lifetime of work - we have eleven million documents!
Learn data journalism and combine it with investigative skills. **Data journalists get hired.** (for a reason)
We got over eleven million documents with thousands of stories in it. Why would someone leak this huge amount of data if he wants only a certain story to be published?He couldnt even be sure we would find this particular story!
Great question! This is the biggest downside of the project: We will never be done. Ever! Seriously, we don't know what stories are still in the data-set. We will continue to use the data-set, for example when some people are becoming of public interest that haven't been before. 
No, because they didn't know about it beforehand. At least we hope that's the case. We have been contacted afterwards but we do not cooperate with Intelligence Agencies. 
We are not giving out any documents to any authorities. But we published and are going to publish certain documents to proof our stories.
We had a secure forum to share findings and discuss them. We also met up a couple of times, in Washington, Munich, Lillehammer, Johannesburg and London. These meetings were really important to build up the trust we needed to work together so closely. These meetings were also great, cause we were not able to talk about our work with anyone else. Finally someone to talk to!To coordinate the work, we set up project groups who were focusing on certain aspects of the Panama Papers. Like Fifa or Russia. We communicated a lot with each other, also via encrypted E-Mails or chats. 
There are countries we found more cases in than in others. Often this is correlated to the corruption index: There are countries with more corruption and shell companies are a typical instrument to hide such dubious activities. But if you look at Malta, Great Britain or Iceland you can see that also Western governments are struggling a lot with the revelations of the Panama Papers.  
We created long lists of politicians, CEOs and other persons of public interests. Then we threw those lists into our data-set. But in the beginning the research was also led by personal interests. Like me, looking for anyone from Bayern Munich. Sadly, I didn't find anybody *(Bastian)*
The ICIJ will release a public database in May. It won't be the 2.6 TB of documents, but they will publish a list with companies, shareholders and clients. (Vanessa)
We don't work together with Intelligence Agencies. Ever. 
Thank you, we really appreciate it!We were really relieved and happy that everything worked out as planned and nothing leaked before. We were fascinated by the reactions and the momentum it created. The PP-landing page made it to the front page of Reddit in a couple of hours, that was amazing! As well as the subreddit you guys created. Our families finally understood the strange way we acted in the months prior: Why we worked so much and had to be so secretive about everything. They were really surprised about how huge this project was.
We had a wall in our research room where we collected all the leads to bigger names and public personas. Each morning we met in front of that wall and it reminded us how important our work is. That was a pretty good motivation. 
That depends on the movie and who would play me. *(Bastian)*
Guys, please, here's an important question.
lol i would love to see that reply
This sounds fishy as hell.
More examples yes: Oktoberfest, Azkaban, Bruni, Fighter, Father, Son, Daughter.... Real names? No. 
It's a leak from an anonymous, unidentified source. Who knows what might be missing from the data set. Stories about big names aren't going to disappear if 400 journalists have access to every document. There's way too much prestige/exposure to gain from it.
He answered it higher up. Americans likely prefer different tax havens than Panama.
We ate a lot of pizza in the last weeks and months and therefore are perfectly qualified to answer this question!Spicy salami *Bastian*Bruschetta *Vanessa*Frederik is already gone but we know for sure he **hates** gyros on his pizza. 
Plot twist: It's the code name for Daniel Radcliffe.
Broad and a little off-topic, but what do you make of the possibility of prosecution of Jan Boehmermann for criticizing Erdogan? Does that have a chilling effect on your work at all? 
Yes, he is hinting at US names?
Great respect for you and all the journalists integrity on this case. It's inspiring.
So whenever I hear someone talk about how boring their dead-end job is and how much they hate it, I have to instantly assume they're actually working on some classified top-secret project??!
Do you think anyone will actually do any time 
Were they aware the nature of your work when you asked them for advice?
This is slightly off-topic but what does f.e. stand for?
Employee? 
How do you keep such a large story/break so quiet, especially with 400 people intimately digging through these documents? Absolutely fascinating!
Thanks for the answer! I don't think there should be any reason to worry - I'm just inquiring because of the sheer amount of powerful people who have been affected and whether any of them have contacted you with vindictive tones!
Rob Schneider makes Mexican day laborers choke him in the shower while he masturbates
If you could orchestrate when in the election cycle releases about the candidates from the papers would come, speaking about a strictly theoretical thought experiment, when would that be?
You're being down-voted but are right. The Putin info would have most likely "disappeared" and would have focused much more on Petro Poroshenko.
"He." "He" couldn't even be sure we would find this particular story.That narrows the whistleblower down to only 3.5 billion people. Get on the case, Reddit! 
I was honestly not expecting an answer! Thank you!
Have you already been approached by some government tax authorities for access to the data for them to conduct their own investigations? 
To be honest, the whole thing sounds like an awesome plot for a movie similar to spotlight.
Awesome. I can't wait to read the story. I know it doesn't mean much, but I sincerely hope you achieve your goal and have all the resources to fulfill it.
> But in the beginning the research was also led by personal interests. Like me, looking for anyone from Bayern Munich. Sadly, I didn't find anybody **(Bastian)**Ah, now we know why he left for Man Utd
+1 for integrity.
I really hope you guys used RED strings to connect leads.
If they ignore it the answer is yes.
Cayman Island Papers confirmed!
> It's a leak from an anonymous, unidentified source. Who knows what might be missing from the data set.> Stories about big names aren't going to disappear if 400 journalists have access to every document. There's way too much prestige/exposure to gain from it.Yup. Having 400 journalists from all over the world working on a project makes it impossible to suppress any findings. 
How does gyros on pizza even work?
I'm not saying that I work with this kind of people or I'm related to this in any way, but if this was me doing the code names, "Harry Potter" would be the codename of Elijah Wood
Yer a felon, Harry!
Having relatives working in intelligence I can say that this is standard protocol involving secrecy
CIA Agents do that..."yeah, I work in IT." Uhh ok 
sounds like /r/citiesskylines
I assume he doesn't want to talk about the "how would you stop one of them from leaking the data to the world part", since that might be sensitive. He mentioned that everyone has access to the data in prior comments too.
Wow, I didn't even know there was something like that. Thanks for that. 
Hahahahahahahahahahahahhah
Do the crime do the time. He can play for the prison team. No one should be above the law.
If you read his linked presentation, they had 1 developer working full time on improvements for the app.  I wanna shake that guy's hand.  Dude is a hero.
The really cool thing is that with this experience under their belt, it will be much easier to mine future data releases. Imagine that the BoA records becomes public.  They can quickly point their tools at the heap of documents and search for the lists of people they have already compiled.  
For example
It really is fascinating! We are actually astonished how well it worked. We were quite sure that a couple of stories would leak before the official publishing date. That didnt happen. So I guess most of us sticked to the most important rule of our project: *Shut up and encrypt.* 
At a certain point everybody involved with the project - such as the graphic designer Peter Hoffmann - had to use PGP-encryption. Imagine how difficult it was to educate an online-team that is used to save everything to top-secret Google drive ;). But we knew about the importance of the visual approach, thus we had to give them a general overview of the stories. (Vanessa)
I just love Reddit...seeing these esteemed journalists wishing Chili_Fart happy cake day made me laugh out loud over my mound of Five Guys fries.
it's called the October Surprise and goes back decades. nothing new. in fact, before TV came along US elections were a lot worse with real fraud and really bad mudslinging and name calling. TV gave us a presidential candidate
I wouldn't be surprised if it purely has to do with timing. The media business is economically strained. The involved have invested a ton of hours into the Panama Papers, so getting the most out of the leak is imperative.Once Americans are  implicated, will the American press be remotely as interested in the international facets of the story?
Putin did nothing wrong
We typed too quickly. Our bad. To be precise: He, she, it or they. 
It's probably too risky (for them/the whistleblower/and a lot more people).If you have the information that famous politicians betray the peoples, you wouldn't and shouldn't trust a intelligence agency.
AFAIK, they were asked to reveal the source. In germany, you dont have to however.
Precedent or not, doesn't matter, the law is clear, the journalist doesn't reveal the source.
I'd pay to watch it.
No, for safety.If it became known that a group of journalists was working with intelligence agencies... who would ever give them any information?  Who might ban them from travelling to cover a story, or arrest them as spies when they did travel?
Its a yes regardless of what they'd say. This is openly public information. 
Or the swiss papers. Or the Luxembourg papers. Or... I think you get it. 
 Is there a worry that the leaker could have disappeared any people from the docs to protect them(or him/herself) or do you feel that that is not a possibility with the scope of info? 
it does not and that is why he hates it
Do you mean Mark Wahlberg?
THAT was funny
Or Wyoming. As best I understand it the US has become the 'new Switzerland' for tax havens.
There are much better options for Americans even if they don't want to keep it stateside than Panama. 
Sorry, some things have to be kept as a secret.... *(Bastian)*
I work in intelligence, but I don't give a shit and do exactly the opposite of what most people do. It's even on my Facebook. I say exactly what I do and how it impacts the intelligence community, while obviously withholding anything classified.
Sales is common as well
Now he said 'All partners *had* access'.Maybe they just temporarily let the other journalists have insight?
How? Unless you require the partners to come to your office and read the documents on paper, after you performed a full body search to make sure they have no cameras on them?Is there something I'm missing here?
Referred to as a Canary trap...
Man, imagine being in prison and seeing that the other team got freaking Messi :(
> Shut up and encrypt.Nice.
Bahahaha I find this hilarious! But honestly though, good job guys. It  is beyond impressive that you guys managed to keep it secure for as long as you did. I am still waiting to see the extent of the fallout from the leak. Here's to hoping that the American public reacts in a similar manner as the people in Iceland did.
I know! I'm honoured.
Except if they get murdered no one is going to know who they were murdered by. They exposed **hundreds** of powerful people. Literally any one could send any assassin after them.
Nixon and Kennedy 
7/11 was a Russian Mob.
Ahh ok ya I remember reading a tweet in German on my phone about "Kommt noch..." I just can't find it for some reason. Would you happen to have that exact one?
Also keep in mind that often, when a huge piece of law is replaced with a new huge piece of law, the old piece is left in the law and it's just listed as repealed.Much of our Tax code is old and antiquated stuff that people don't take out.
Thank you for the tip, I'll look into it. Since I've ended my subscription with Die Zeit I'm missing something and didn't knew about SZ Wochenende.
Damn, now we're up to world population plus possible alien/entity involvement. It's bigger than we thought! We need more people on this case!
yes, "the leaker" would be masculine, a lot of german terms is "masculine" in or heads, especially if it ends with "-er".for example, for me, if on reddit someone writes about a teacher, i always first assume to a male, since here we also use something like "teacheress".
Interesting... if Mossack Fonseca (heh, their initials is "MF") doesn't see news about some big person (let's say Angela Merkel), they might assume the leaker purged the leaks of references to Angela Merkel (hard to with 11M documents), and they, or the thugs they've hired, could investigate internal people who want to protect Angela Merkel, and "ask" them (with a large baseball bat) if they're involved with the leak.
Microsoft licensing is in Nevada. The company is registered in Delaware, but its licensing arm (which collects all windows revenue) is in Nevada. Double tax dodge. 
The people demand the truth!
Found the corporate IT guy.
I'd think a lot less actually work on the data than released the data. That way you can't distinguish who simply released it and who worked on it. 
As a reference to the Canary Islands, which didn't exist until a mapmaker put them there to catch map stealers.
Quick, frame Ronaldo for the other side.
can't remember the details, but i read in the 1800's they would make up what was essentially slander against your opponent
Nsa got to him
There is basically no way someone handed them 11 million documents lolits already in data form
I read this once, had no idea wtf you were saying until the last line. It made re-reading it that much more special <3
I think a lot of people seem to forget this. Not a lot of stuff has a sunset period stuck on to it. So when it gets codified into law, it's permananet. 
It wasn't me, so you can take me off that possible list
Yep. In this case 'she' also would have been a comprehensible mistake, since 'source' is female in german. 
Big cookie dosent want you to know!! Wake up sheeple!!!
I know you're lying but I can't help but think it's true.
The same thing has been done since forever. It's clever though.For example, cartographers (map makers) used to insert fake places onto their maps. If another map copied theirs, it would be spotted easily.I believe the ebook indutsry does something similar to track piracy with small differences or typos that you might not even notice.
>Grand Maister piscelGrand Maester Pycelle?
Thanks KenM
Username checks out 
I feel like most people won't get this comment.
Fuck can you imagine being the assistant to these journalists, "I am going to need a few documents scanned..."
That's just what you would say. 
>He/he, She/she, It/it, or They/they.How's that?
>Wake up oaties!!!FTFY
The secret ingredient is Love, duh.
> tpyos> typos Gotcha. That'll be one bajillion currencies please.
I don't know why I found his spelling so funny but I can't stop laughing:D
Who is "Our"? That is really interesting. I'd like to read more into it.
Yes, i was working there at the time. It was quite amusing to see. Google put undiscoverable web pages up with words consisting of random letters, and observed with statistical certainty that either IE or some Bing related software was pulling results and relevance rankings from Google's search results (if I recall correctly).Basically scraping Google's search results ranking algorithm to use on Bing
That is what he, she, it or they would say, too.
Omfg... The number of people that could be involved in this is increasing at an incredible rate.  The only pronoun they didn't use was "you"... Does that mean I'm the only one NOT in on it???
Morgan and Morgan. For the people. 
Raisin some important questions here.
Look again :\^)
It's almost as funny as when I saw someone mispell (or autocorrect) the rapper's name as "Nicki Manage."
Your comment made me realize how much I'm immersed in GOT and ASOIAF. I read OP's comment, understood the reference without batting an eye and moved on. Obviously, it's obscure if you don't follow GOT/ASOIAF religiously.
Mitch_Hedberg_reply.txt
Yep, was about to post the same.  There is no mention of Lincoln raiding a rival's headquarters in that link.  I searched a few different terms and couldn't find any details about the raid on other sites or articles.
Whereas for me, seeing him as House is what seems weird :-)
oh shit hes on to us
Ahh! You read my lawblog?
Feel free to chip away at them.
It's weird though, I just binged re-watched it in like a week last month and I'm super active on the sub, I just haven't seen that scene come up very often.
I used to Mitch_Hedberg_reply.txt. I still do, but I used to too. 
> having a pussy like our Founding Fathers did. Which of the Founding Fathers had a pussy?
Never. I think it's my duty as a guest to always accept when my host is offering a good thing. When people are expressing themselves by what they offer, I feel it's my duty to if necessary take one for the team. It's what I call a "grandma rule"; I may not like grandma's turkey, but I'm in grandma's house, I'm gonna eat it. And I'm gonna smile and say I like it. I think that's just good manners. If you treat me like an idiot though and serve me crap with utter contempt. I can spiral into a serious depression for days and I will not be nice about it. This means you, Johnny Rockets.
I have an unholy and guilty attraction to fast-food macaroni and cheese. During the morning I get these horrendous cravings for Popeye's mac and cheese, and, uh, I will often disguise myself to try to slip into Popeyes. Or in a pinch, I will even go to the Colonel. There, I admit it. And I'm always recognized. I hate Twitter, because immediately they take a picture of me holding the evidence in my hand. It's like getting caught coming out of a porn shop with a video in your arms. Very embarrassing. 
What did Gordon Ramsay say last AMA? Foam?
You know the show I haven't been able to make yet, I'd like to do a show with Keith Richards. I'm working on it.  He's an enthusiast and a voracious reader.  He's very interested in British naval history. Maybe visiting the site of great British naval battles with Keith Richards, eat bangers and mash, cooking steak and pie together would be really fun That's something I'd really love to do. 
It's a tough question. I used to think Vietnam for a long time but lately... I'm leaning very much toward Italy! I like it there! I like the food. All those carbs are dangerous but Italy's a pretty nice place.
I just moved to Madison and was surprised to find it has the most restaurants per capita in the United States
It is very delicious. Very delicious.
The sandwiches I crave most when I'm abroad are a pastrami on rye from Pastrami Queen, in New York. They do a sandwich at the restaurant at the Ace Hotel that is insanely delicious. It's this super crispy thin Sardinian style flat bread smeared with butter, chilis, and Bottarga, which is like salted tuna or mullet eggs. Doesn't sound so good but man it's good, especially with a cold beer. If that doesn't sound good to you, you're always safe with a great pastrami sandwich. We do it best in New York. 
Whoa! What have I made in my life? Wow! You've caused me to reflect on my utterly worthless existence. I mean, I give a cute answer, I assisted in the making of a 9 year old girl. A birdhouse, a chest of drawers, I really wish I could do those things. Everything I ever made with my hand, you know it was food, it literally turned to shit within 8 hours. So...wow...Oh my god! I'm really depressed now!
I dunno, I'm thinking about a French dip sandwich. They do those really well in LA. Or I dunno, I had tacos at Danny Trejo's place last night, so I might go back! They were good. 
I did not get to keep the knife. I bid on it online; it was put up for auction. I bid $5,000, but I saw that the lowest bid at the time, or the current high bid was something like $22,000. So needless to say I did not get that knife. I did, however, finally after a wait of longer than a year, I did get the opportunity to buy a Kramer knife. It is easily my most valued physical object that I own. It is a thing of beauty, and I'm just waiting to find food worthy of it, to use it. 
Twenty dollars?! I don't know. It might be a dirty water hot dog. You know? A bagel, with some butter, or no! A bialy. A toasted bialy with some butter, maybe at like Barney Greengrass, and then...what, do I die after spending this $20? Is that what happens? I mean, it's a pretty good value, maybe I'll have two bialys for $20. 
That was my one and only time at waffle house. It is a strange and exotic wonderland to me.  I really have yet to explore it fully. I was obviously thoroughly taken by it and cannot wait to go back. In fact, I have a secret urge, as a lot of my chef friends do, their secret urge is that they want cook at Waffle House. Just for a day to see if they can hack it because it's a tough gig. No, so I haven't been back, they don't have it in the New York/Tristate area unfortunately. If they did I would be hitting that place hard and often. They're wonderful. 
My favorite Kentucky bourbon? Very very old Fitzgerald, that's some nice stuff. If you were to present me with a bottle of very very very very very old Fitzgerald, I don't know if it exists, but man that's good. I have to say, my friend Sean Rock is constantly coming up with these freakishly rare bottles of bourbon that I never thought of as particularly good, that are amazing. So it's not a subject I know much about, but I look forward to finding out. 
No, I do it without shame. I'm like super organized, I'm a list maker, and I have a schedule. I'm not one of those people who calls a restaurant at the last minute and says, "Do you know who I am?" I plan ahead. I do make reservations. And I always show up for them. You know, making multiple reservations in multiple restaurants on the same night at the same time and blowing off the other ones? That's right up there with being rude to your server, as far as restaurant crimes. They should keep a file on such people. In fact, some restaurants do! 
Coolest shit I ever found anywhere? I dunno, I mean the most cool shit per square foot is probably in Tokyo. You know, if you're looking for cool shit, your statistical likelihood of finding some is gonna be in Tokyo. Wow, what a tough question. Yeah, try Tokyo. 
Banh Mi place in Hoi An! 
I've been really lucky. I had one early injury as a white belt, but lately it's going really, really well. Feeling pretty good about leg attacks. They run in the family. I'm training out in LA at Cobrinha and at 5 Star, and really enjoying it. I'm very happy and I'm staying healthy so far. 
You've probably seen it, but for those that haven't, the Parts Unknown episode on heroin addiction in Massachusetts was really good.
In my case, I write everything. I write every word. I have found that the only way I can write is early in the morning, first thing, stone-cold sober. So I will wake up, start writing, and write for as long as I can. I get stupider as the day goes on. I just get stupider and stupider as it gets later in the day. So, yeah, stone-cold sober, first thing in the morning. No other way for me. Nothing's gonna help me do anything but get distracted. If smoking weed is first on your list of things to do, you're probably not getting to #2. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
We're hoping to be open by 2019, so we're two years out. We're getting there! 
What an excellent well thought out question. I really wish Anthony answered it. I have that same person (gal) living in me and right now she's winning. 
Soon I hope! It's always a lot of fun to hang out with Joe. I like him very much, I like his podcast. But I will tell you that if Joe Rogan ever wants to demonstrate a choke on you, don't let that happen. He's like, really really really strong, and yeah. Just, it hurts. A lot. 
The books that I reread, I reread Orwell's essays all the time. The Quiet American, by Graham Greene. The Friends of Eddie Coyle, by George V. Higgins, it's a great crime book.  Joan Didion's essays or collected Joan Didion is terrific. Patricia Highsmith, The Ripley's series is great. True Grit! You've seen the movie, read the book. It is amazing, it is really amazing writing. 
I've noticed this question coming up again and again. No. I don't think it's a sandwich. I don't think a hamburger is a sandwich either. The fact that it's in between bread--the bread is a delivery system, a ballistic delivery system. It is not a classic sandwich, in my view. I mean, if you were to talk into any vendor of fine hot dogs, and ask for a hot dog sandwich, they would probably report you to the FBI. As they should. 
No. I'm not rolling with that guy, it hurts. He does not roll light, he goes really really hard. He's a neck cranker, by the way, and he's got bowling balls for arms, no visible neck, and he only rolls with no gi. So as much as I love the guy, I'll do anything with him; shoot animals in the brain, canoe trip, hot tubbing, whatever. But I'm not rolling with the guy. 
Louise Brooks, Orson Welles, and James Angleton the former head of capital intelligence for the CIA. There's a couple of questions I'd like to ask him. They're all dead unfortunately. 
It's my special event. You know there's always a special time for me where I move over to Scotch. Generally, when I'm in a philosophical, reflective, or otherwise bittersweet kind of a mood, when I'm drinking alone, listening to music by myself; you know, maybe before a holiday meal or something like that and I have company over. But it's not like every day. I'm a beer drinker, ordinarily. So if I'm drinking expensive whiskey, it's gonna be a special event.
I love Girl & the Goat, I love Avec, I really like that restaurant. Who is it, Johnnie's Beef? Good stuff. Any Chicago hot dog is the finest in the land, love that product. I dunno, Girl & the Goat I really love. 
I'm 60 years old, I don't feel punk rock at all. 
If he doesnt answer, go eat at Cochon or Toup's Meatery.
I don't know why this made me laugh.   How do you serve somebody food with contempt? "Here we have a delicious dish that my my grandmother used to make me when I was in Italy and I'd be honored if you'd try it.   You stupid little bitch"
You come out of both with sticky fingers and regret.
Which is great because on the season finale of MasterChef somebody made a foam for him and he hated it.
Nerding out over naval tactics and great food. Please, please make this series!
Young Italians are so slim compared to other Western countries, which makes no sense given all those carbs! And then they hit middle age and it catches up on them 
The 12, but 5 years more.
Man. I've walked by Pastrami Queen a few times and thought about going in. Now it's gonna be packed after people read this AMA. Thanks, Bourdain. 
>Everything I ever made with my hand, you know it was food, it literally turned to shit within 8 hours. You never fail to make me laugh.
Everybody is replying to this about their fucking french dip and ignoring the fact that Tony was eating tacos with Machete himself.
Can you show us a picture of your Kramer knife?
Reading this (and all your other answers) in your voice makes this AMA top-tier.
You should see waffle house on christmas morning in Georgia..Delicious food, horrifying red-necks. 
People who don't respect reservations irk me to no end. I made a reservation for a large group of people, half those people don't show up until 45 minutes AFTER the reservation and get grouchy when the staff lets them know that there is another table after us in ~40 minutes.
I can confirm this. Biggest city in the world, but has cool shit everywhere. Even in random suburbs. Small parks, cool little ramen shops, shady (for Japan) alleys, vending machines everywhere. 
I'm surprised that a jiu jitsu question is this far down the thread. Joe Rogan has said multiple times on the podcast that you're obsessed with jiu jitsu. Is that true or is he exaggerating? Congrats on getting your blue belt BTW! 
I shit my pants when I watched that episode and recognized your voice. I'm pulling for a reoccurring role just as much as you are. 
aaaaand it all comes back to Seinfeld.
There, it's settled.
I guess you could say you have... Some Reservations.
> Girl & the GoatCurrently has 666 reviews.  So uh, does that goat have a name?  
Punk isn't dead, it just goes to bed at a more reasonable hour. 
> I don't know why this made me laugh. How do you serve somebody food with contempt?I thought I heard thunder, but it was just the sound of everyone in the restaurant industry rolling their eyes at once. 
Redditor for 30 minutes. I don't know what I expected... 
As well as cheese everywhere
Hell I'm surrounded by amazing food, there are more authentic mom and pop mexican and tex mex restaurants near me in NYC that I could visit if I went out *every night for a year.*But once or twice a year I'll still get some taco bell.  It's not mexican food, the only way it can be classified is it's just taco bell.   Every single time I do it though I'm always shocked by the price, I can't shake the knowledge that I'm paying nearly twice as much as a mom/pop, for worse quality food.  Worth it, if only for the childhood nostalgia.
My mother in law knows how to make mole from scratch.The "true" recipe, needs a burned tortilla, the tortilla is first hand made, dough and all.The recipe(s) includes at least 6 different types of chili, then toasted almods, chocolate, onion and garlic sauted in lard, tomatos, several herbs, chicken broth.Sometimes, the variants include peanuts, sesame seeds, squash seeds.They often mix a banana to help with the density and sweetness of the sauce.The preparation takes at least 4 hours, and it's always FANTASTIC.
His ways are simple, that of a man at peace.
My go-to response to "What's your favorite beer?">My favorite beer is either cold, open or free. 
Best taco I ever had, dont remember the name of the place I think I was in Austin, ten years ago. It was late, i was hungry, I looked on Yelp. Only place open at that time down some back alley. They didnt speak a lick of English. Took a posters advice and got the 'Barbicoa Taco'. Three of them actually. SO FUCKING GOOD. I didnt know what barbicoa was but our friends had me convinced it was baby goat. 
Good Chinese -REAL Chinese cuisine, not the americanized takeout variety- is amazingly underrated. So, so good.
Of today, you mean
> The dude looked like a lady. Made Jagger laugh.Stephen Tyler would've found it funnier.
Walking.  The thing that impressed me most about Italy was how many Italians walked places.  The only people who are typically seen walking in the states are the homeless, crazy, or destitute.
please adopt me...
Cheeto-tan desu is going to build a wall.
Have you ever seen Guy Fieri and Donald Trump in the same room?
For anyone confused, Charleston is in South Carolina. North Carolina has good food, too, but I think Bourdain meant SC.
I love how anyone says anything remotely good about mpls, and the Minnesotans come out of the woodwork.Minnesota is the best!
KBBQs in Korea don't really do the all-you-can-eat that lots of LA KBBQs have. Oh, the glorious benefit of millions of Korean immigrants combined with a plentiful and cheap supply of meat in the US....
I like how you don't specify which event he's referring to.(p.s., for others, it's the octopus one, not the cabaret)
Kind of like my ex wife.  Except the hot part.
It also made for a pretty fantastic and surreal episode.

Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know how to use chopsticks. He knows EXACTLY how to use chopsticks.
yep, At no time was the president out of sight of at least 2 secret service agents.
You are right. They were most definitely all secret service agents.
Might frame this quote and put it in my kitchen
Pretty sure he meant he went to Danny Trejo's new taco restaurant, not his home, as it's a hot new place rn. 
Cmon man, Switzerland isn't *that* bad.
Maybe his parents were insufferably neutral?
Pair with fava beans and chianti?

To be fair my Sister-in-law was reached out to by top chef and nobody in my family has any pull with any members of Top Chef producers. My sister had passed in an accident and she was the brides maid so the wedding was postponed, when top chef found out they catered and set up the whole thing (obviously with cameras but very non-intrusive and very fun) so some anecdotal evidence :) (top chef all-stars roughly 4 years ago)
There are cooking shows, then there is Masterchef Australia. Miles above the rest
This will sound stupid but he writes exactly how he speaks in real life (at least when he is on TV). When I read Kitchen Confidential, it felt like he was sitting across from me telling a story. 
Any morning at any Waffle House is always fun. 
A few of the more popular restaurants where I live flat out tell you when you make a reservation that they will hold it for 10 minutes past the arrival time and no more, your table will go to someone else if there are people waiting. It sets the expectation.
They'll need many rice and beans to get there.
I mean, to also be fair, the idea of an "insincere" restaurant is completely alien to me as just some average schmuck. It's purpose, then, is just to be satirical of food trends? That's the shakiest business plan I've ever heard of. Smaller, more authentic restaurants have popped up and gone back under for a thousand different reasons, yet this joke of a restaurant is a mainstay? Sounds weird. I would never have assumed a restaurant wasn't taking itself seriously because of the risk in attracting people just for humor's sake.
Me too! I was there for 10 days and every day was like a new adventure. Next time I'm going for a month. It's brilliant 
I saw him make it for Anderson Cooper one time.
As I sit here drinking beer and smoking pot after my (non food related) stressful day. Had to lol But now I'm excited to make myself dinner. 
As an employee in a non-food related business who shows up everyday on time and cashes in weeks of unused vacation time each year...>  You'll own the place some day.No thanks. You can keep those headaches to yourself. Just keep the doors open so I have a job to show up to.
Conway stern popped into my head right awaaaaaaay!
smalahove is totally real, dude.  And it looks just like a sheep's face on your plate
I think this can be the definitive response. Not just a "no" but a "this is so wrong that you should be reported to the authorities"
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
He has many names.

You might want to consult a doctor.
Taco bell is just leagues ahead value/taste wise of every fast food joint not named in n out. Yea I can get a good burger from Jack in the Box for 6.50. But who the fuck decided that a decent fast food burger is worth 6 bucks??? I spent 15 dollars at Carl's junior the other day on a milkshake, 5 tiny chicken tenders, and a soggy burger. I spent 7 dollars at taco bell for a soda, 2 tacos, a gordita, and a burrito. Thank you taco bell for staying true to what fast food should be.
god this is the artisanal firewood commercial all over again.
Do you want it to be artisanal or not?
You're the problem! They are just regular thicker than normal chips seasoned by the hands of the animal control guy.
You're going to make me drown in my own drool.  Mole is so deep and complex.  Honestly, I don't know of anything in French cuisine that's anywhere near that "depth and complexity."
I think a lot of people have been burned by going to places that weren't cheap holes-in-the-wall and paying $20 for Chinese-American, pseudo-Asian grub. So the idea of a hole-in-the-wall became appealing, and equated with cheap. 
He is who we all inspire to be.
Preferably all of the above
My favorite Mexican restaurant is in a strip mall with all Mexican owned businesses. They are packed for lunch and dinner and it's all Hispanic workers and a few "locals" mixed in. Their food is killer. There is then a Mexican restaurant up the street and around the corner that is Tex-Mex at best. It's good if that is what you want and if you were to ask 10 people around here what the best Mexican food was, 9 would say the Tex-Mex place. Most people you ask about the other place and they either say that they never considered it or they didn't want to stop in because of where it was. 
Authentic street tacos are just...absolute heaven. I have no idea how we took the miracle that is the street taco, and warped it into this monstrous abomination that is the Americanized hard-shell ground beef taco... don't get me wrong, those tacos can be good, but they do not deserve to share the same label as street tacos. There's a little taco truck near my office and their al pastor tacos ... I would do terrible dirty things for those tacos with no regrets
That's a nice thought but it's not true. Joe's North End Spaghetti might make good sauce, but there's a restaurant in Boston serving smoked sumac jello. That's as unique as it gets
This, man. I worked at a chinese joint in college as their only English speaking employee. I bussed, I took orders, I answered the 6 phones for delivery, I expo'd, etc etc. It was the hardest I ever worked but I loved it because every night at 9 every employee in the building would gather around a big table in the middle of the restaurant and we would eat traditional chinese food for an hour on the house. I learned a lot about both myself and how I approach cooking while I was there and I wish there were more places to order actual chinese food, not the taco bell version, around me now.
I mean, MSG is today considered harmless. Gluten will probably be considered harmless tomorrow, except for people with Celiac disease. 
Don't forget the New Yorkers, we walk everywhere. (People in DC, Boston, SF, Chicago, etc. all do a fair amount of walking too). Wait, were we included in the crazy? We're pretty crazy.
I've heard rumor that Guy Fieri, the fat guy from ICP, and the lead singer from smash mouth are in fact all the same person. 
Nc shout out for Asheville thought. Woot!
It's not just Minneapolis. We come out of the woodwork for any part of minnesota that's mentioned.
Took the words right out of Bourdain's mouth. 
Prince's was on a episode of Man vs Food I believe it was. That poor, poor guy. I don't like their chicken particularly well, but man they can make it peel-the-skin-off-the-inside-of-your-mouth hot.
Especially if you're Lebanese, like me, and remember those days all too clearly
I kinda find it surprising that /r/scotch has almost double what /r/whiskey does
> It will be more expensive than a bottle of the vodka you drink in college, but less than a night out drinking.Truer words cant be spoken, buy a nice bottle of whatever that you can drink over a week or 2 instead of going out to the bar for 1 night.
Not until I see his long form chop stick certificate!
Can we really say, 100% positive, that Anthony Bourdain ain't secret service? 
"I have no strong feelings one way or the other".

He is not serious. They have way more time (usually a day) than that and it's not 500 people.
as a general rule, i hate cooking competition shows. I love masterchef australia. It's totally fucking insane.
His audiobooks are fantastic for that reason.
It's always morning at Waffle House
I think you mean lentils 
If you go a month try to balance out city days with rural days. The small towns are every different and much quieter, but nice too. 
They're really like a 2 on the world "shady alley" scale but the Japanese still avoid them haha. Makes them oddly endearing. 
right with ya.  This is why i don't think i could ever be a chef.  I'll work 12 hours, then get home and cook.  It's how I unwind after a long day.  I imagine having to cook in such a stressful environment would rob me of that pleasure.  Cooking is how i relax.  I can't picture that attitude going over well when you're knee deep in tickets and the FOH is shitting bricks because it will affect their tips.
Lol wait, people are *paid* to be dicks? And people *pay* to be treated like shit? This country is more fucked than I thought.
Who the fuck pays to eat at a place that insults you and then sues because she got insulted?Probably just a premeditated scam tbh.
Oh my god, I bet it was! Getting paid to say *exactly* what you'd think on any given shitty day? ***Sign me the fuck up, asshole.***
"i am sorry, you have incurable cheese dick"
Pretty sure he was commenting on the garlic aioli. 
do you mean aspire or am I too high
Yeah, I have a lot of questions for massive_cock
I don't think Tex Mex is an inferior cuisine, it's just a different region.  Unfortunately it's impossible to find good examples outside of South/central Texas.  The best barbacoa I ever had was an unmarked white truck in San Antonio that was only open Saturday, only took cash, spoke zero English, and consistently had a line around the block until they sold out.  The meat was some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had, served with warm fresh corn tortillas.  They could have tripled the price and it would still be a bargain.
Love a good century (pidan/preserved) egg in jook. They're only "preserved" for about 2 weeks despite their name.
New York City has the highest average step count of all US cities according to fitbit.  That's a fact I learned two days ago, and I'm pleased to be able to share it today.
My son is in Rome now and mentioned that every time he gets in the taxi the drivers make him feel like he's in a chase scene from a Jason Bourne movie.  Says they are absolutely nuts.
Heading back to Asheville for a short vacation home after several years in China...can't fucking wait!  Great food and great beer everywhere!  Great people too...Asheville folk are just chill as hell.
Charleston represent!
too true. pretty much the only time I comment on anything is when Minnesota comes up. lol
In the US, we heard about what was going on but it wasn't made to be as big of a deal. I remember watching AB's episode of No Reservations and how the night before he was on rooftop bars with locals having a blast, carefree. The next morning they're running for their lives.He covered the situation better on a fucking cooking show than any other 24 hour news network. 
/r/whiskey is kind of a blanket sub that doesn't have much real purpose. Kind of like r/sports. 
=)My personal go to is the Laphroaig 10 year, very smokey, intense flavors, but recommending it to a beginner is like recommending scuba diving as a way to learn how to swim. 
"Who are all of these shmucks lining up outside my shop?""Dad, they're customers. Anthony Bourdain said you make the best sandwiches.""Course they're the best sandwiches. That's right there on the sign: best sandwiches. Can these people not read?"
With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows?  It sickens me. 
Yeah I was on Rachel ray once and we spent two weekends shooting a bit they edited into a "one night" catering event that had a whole kitchen staff helping. Also Micheal Simon is the coolest dude I've ever personally met 
Not for me! I used to work next to a Waffle House, and I often left work for the night around 3:15 or so. I sometimes went to Waffle House after to order a triple hashbrown. It's a lot of food for almost no money. I put every sauce on it, but on different parts of it so it was almost like having a dozen tiny hashbrowns that were different flavors. The steak sauce was the best, so I'd eat that part last and then start the long walk home.  I still get sleepy when I get Waffle House.
My favorite part was going to the smaller towns to the local mom and pop restaurants that have no English menu. Very friendly and fed me amazing food (and sake of course)
There really is something special about coming home buzzed and firing up the grill at 230 in the morning.  
The restaurant Dick's Last Resort is the same way. They act like Dicks.

Here in Australia is it nigh on *impossible* to find an authentic, decent Mexican restaurant. We've resorted to learning all the recipes and making it ourselves, but I'd love to try the real thing!
I have... one question.
I lived in Maryland and almost every butcher looked at me like a degenerate when I asked for cheek meat because no one there had ever tried the kind of barbacoa we take for granted here in Texas.I'll add that at least here in Houston, we have some good interior Mexican restaurants that have a lot of the things Bourdain was talking about. Hell we have a bar that serves Mezcal a traditional Oaxaca way with orange slices that have been sprinkled with sal de gusano.
Boy, I'd love to try some pidan congee right now. Throw in some pork sung and I will refuse to eat anything else for half a day. 
It's just so wonderfully walkable. If you decide that you don't want to take the subway and decide to walk wherever you want to go, getting there is actually safe. If I were to decide, living in the suburbs, that I wanted to walk down to the store, I have to stay right on the edge of the road and duck into the woods if I hear a car coming because there are absolutely no safe walking paths anywhere. You hop in a car or you fuck right off with the idea of going anywhere.
He earned the Emmy for that one.
What!? I love sports! I like teams! I like to wath games where those teams score points  and the coaches coach the players. Man sports are the best
This made me really happy for some reason. Just the mental image.
Yeah like a perfectly rare steak because I'm too impatient to let it cook
At least when you're at Dick's you're usually drunk enough not to care that they wrote about squirrel pussy on your paper hat. At least that was my experience. I love Vegas. 
Please, Dr. Bubbler is my father. You can just call me Farty.
Of course that's a thing...
Omg. How do you remember my username.  Seriously.  Gotta love the Internet. 
Not anymore, it's already spread to twitter. What a mighty virus we are all connected to.
I've got family in new Zealand. They couldn't even get Italian food right over there. I had spaghetti and meatballs from a FANCY restaurant in Christchurch that tasted like it had sriracha and tomato sauce poured all over it. I dont think they even would know what Mexican food is there. And God forbid you wanna buy an avocado. SIX dollars a piece!
Nope. It's just to mock an ex who stalked me off my original handle.
It's like in Farenheit 451 where that girl goes walking everywhere and the main character thinks that walking is weird.
Don't you just love it when the US wins the Super Bowl?
You like it, you little bitch
google fu. your new word was a /r/bestof post so it was actually pretty easy 
that douche on twitter used it out of context too.
But then he realizes the poetry of walking and how it lets you experience life not as a blur, but as a beautiful scene.Until he nearly gets hit by a car racing at 100 mph.
> excgarated    Was the intended word exaggerated?
Paging /u/PitchforkEmporium
Just "Dan" is best. "Daniel" is fine, but I always sort of think I'm in trouble. And "Danny," I think, if you call yourself "Danny" you give everyone around you the right to sing "Danny Boy" to you ALL THE TIME, and it's a nice song, but once you've heard it 1,000 times, you don't want to hear it every time you introduce yourself to somebody. 
I suppose I would... I would remove the bullshit hierarchy from the film industry, because there are certain people who do my job, and also directors and producers, who seem to think the job they do gives them license to treat people who work for them badly, and there is no good reason for that, and it should not be tolerated.I know that if I ever get to direct, it will not be present anywhere on my set. 
George Clooney... Jennifer Lawrence... I just think they'd be really cool, Paul Rudd, I met him and was like "You're awesome!" I just want to work with people you can get on with, and you have a good rapport with, and those are definitely some of them. Also directors more than actors, whom I think "I want to work with them." So you know, people like the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, again, it's directors i suppose I get more excited about than actors. 
well, which Hedwig? There were 3 or 4. I imagine they are all still living with Gary Gero, who was the head of the animals department on Potter. I imagine he is looking after them all somewhere. I imagine they are all at the home where actor owls retire to. 
Um.... Well, growing up, my favourite comic book character was Daredevil, so Daredevil was great, but there was also, like, if I could be one character from all of literature it would be... Woland from my favourite book, wait no, I change my answer, I would be Behemoth the cat from my favourite book which is called The Master and Margarita, and he is like, a 5 foot tall black cat who shoots a revolver. 
That's a *GOOD* question. I don't know yet, I haven't narrowed it down, but because I've very recently - like within the last 6 months - watched the original Star Wars movies, I'm like a brand new Star Wars fan, so I might go with something Star Wars related! And I got to go out to the Star Wars set recently, because a lot of my friends are working on it crew-wise.. so something Star Wars related, but not sure yet.Any suggestions? I'm leaning towards Boba Fett, but I haven't found a good enough costume yet. 
Probably Sirius. Like I always loved the character, and then Gary's portrayal of him I thought was perfect. Or Lupin, really. Any of the characters my dad used to hang out with, other than Wormtail. There was always something bout those two guys I loved a lot. 
Hispanic guy here:Tamales.  There's really nothing that tastes better than a good tamale.  Not one of those weak Texas tamales that are the size of a Vienna sausage either.  I'm talking about tamales made by poor people in California & Mexico.  Tamale quality is inversely proportional to the standard of living of the people making them.  I don't know why.
Oh yeah, of course. I wasn't going to leave there without grabbing a set of glasses!
*WOW.*Um... that's a really good question. First of all, congratulations to you for asking me a Harry Potter question I have NEVER been asked before, that is *not* easily achieved!I would say... I was gonna say my iPod, prolly put it in that, but I would put it inside an album on the iPod, so you'd have to open that album. So I somehow want it to be connected to a particular album that means something, like Ziggy Stardust. So that's how I'd want to do that. 
> all of the kids that grew up acting in Harry Potter ended up very grounded and intelligentExcept for Crabbe.
Um, the Colbert Report. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Yeah, like I JUST discovered them, and I am *obsessed* at the moment! They're amazing yeah! And there's also an English show, called The Thick of It, which is kind of a show - Armando Ianucci who does VEEP, it was the political show that spring boarded him to start working here, and it's some of the best, funniest television that's ever been made. 
Wonderful. I mean, he was just such a sweet man. You know... kind of relentlessly charming with women, I think I'm pretty sure I saw him flirting with female journalists at press conferences, I remember being a young child in awe of it... but yeah, he was a legend, and so to have been able to work with somebody of that generation, which was an incredibly important generation of actors for Britain, is amazing. 
Hmmm.I suppose I'm trying to... I'm trying to care less what people think of me, and the way I have done that, very successfully the past few months now, is *not* look at stuff on the internet. That is the key. 
He really does! Um, and, er, he also owned at one point, at one point he owned llamas and a hovercraft, you heard correctly, hahaha, and a 1950's chevy pickup, he had a collection of weird and wonderful things at his house. 
The villain. 100%. I think it's generally more interesting, and honestly, more what I'm suited for, to be honest. I don't see myself necessarily - I mean, I know there was a lot of action in Potter and I liked those sequences, but I don't think of myself as a natural action star. 
I mean, I... to me, it's not a... to me I absolutely think I would be in Gryffindor! But there's never any doubt of that for me. Yeah. I like, maybe I'm just biased because I played one for so long, but I could never picture myself in any other colours. 
*YES*!Just write that movie! And absolutely! 
Can they be dead?Okay.Well, uh, I would say, um: this is hard. Probably John Lennon, cuz that'd be awesome, and, uh, Tom Lehrer, who's a comic songwriter whom I'm obsessed with, yeah, and what's an all-time dinner fantasy party without Einstein? So Einstein, *yeah*! and probably Keith Richards, yeah, to liven everything up.  
It was actually a really lazy photographer that wanted to get his editor to stop bugging him.
Um, we listened to heavy metal, basically. That was it. Yeah! And because the two guys that were doing the makeup, Mike McCarthy and Mike Fields, they were both big metal heads, and I mean, the actual process -they made it *so* easy - the horns themselves only took about 20 minutes to put on, and even some of the more extreme makeup that we had near the end only took a couple of hours, so you know, I had it easier than a lot of actors do. And yeah, so Metallica, Megadeth, and what was the other band we listened to loads of... *shit*... can't remember it'll come back to me. 
Browsing this AMA, not answering it.
You know what, I don't think we did I'm pretty sure. Because I think that by that point, they had figured out my handwriting was so bad that they would never let it be seen in the film. So I'm pretty sure one of the props guys wrote "Harry Potter" neatly on a piece of paper for me to put in. 
VERY important. To be honest, if Alex Aja and Joe Hill are happy with my performance, then I'm happy with it! Those are the two people I'm thinking about most, and talking to most, about my thoughts on the character and my approach to it. 
HAHA! Brilliant. Just like... it was exhausting, but New Zealand's lovely all year 'round. 
Em - the Potter Puppet Pals were always, I thought, very very funny. It is hard to make really good Harry Potter jokes, though, because a lot of them have been done, but I thought Puppet Pals were very funny. The best "Alan Rickman as Snape" impression was, 100%, Bill Hader when I did Saturday Night Live, yeah, but maybe my favourite joke at Harry Potter's expense was in South Park, the episode, The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring. It's not a very PC joke, but it really made me laugh. 
I haven't been approached! And I don't know - haha- I don't know what I would do. My lack of Game of Thrones knowledge was revealed in an interview a while ago. I totally would side with the Starks, though, because their symbol is a wolf. 
Not really.Even as a kid, I hadn't the full scope of the Harry Potter phenomenon, hadn't really, ever, made an impression on me I guess? Obviously I'd read the first couple of books, but I wasn't as into it as a lot of my class was, so no, I could never have imagined it was as big as it was. I think maybe it's only now that I'm really starting to get a fuller sense of how wide-reaching it was, and how many people's lives it affected, which is very cool. 
Only, uh, for myself. I think Shakespeare is a wonderful thing to work on for me when I want to prepare for a part but I don't want to over-work on the script. So I will find a character in Shakespeare that i feel explores the same themes as whatever i'm playing, and sort of work on it like that, because the way Shakespeare writes, he writes so viscerally about so many universal things, that it's an amazing resource for actors preparing.But I would LOVE to do some for real. 
I'm listening to a lot of Jamie T's music lately, his new album's great... what else have I been listening to? First Aid Kits, I"m really into them right now. I've also rediscovered somebody around called Sister Rosetta Tharp, and you should all - she is just an amazing singer from the 1940's and 50's, way ahead of her time, great voice. 
Cool! Thank you very much! Well, I did a romantic comedy that came out this summer called "What if" that is pretty funny, and I hope I get to do a lot of comedy for the rest of my career. It's what i grew up watching, mostly, so I am definitely drawn to it, and I like to think I bring a bit of it to anything I do - even a dramatic film like "Kill Your Darlings" can have some very light moments to it as well. 
Yeah... favourite scene to film... god... that is a *really hard* question, to pick just one... the first thing that comes to mind, and it's a silly one, but doing all the Gringott's stuff in the last movie with Rupert and Helena and Warwick and Emma, that was like a really fun time. We were all enjoying ourselves in that, it's an action sequence so it was quite, it was more of a technical challenge than an emotional one, so it was a lot of fun to get right. 
I think it stays very true to the book. Of course some things have to change, but to me, what makes the book remarkable is the mixing of the romantic elements, the comic elements, and the, sort of, horror and fantasy stuff, and what we have absolutely done in the film is captured all those tones and they compliment each other beautifully as they do in the book. So that would be the biggest success of the movie's adaptation. 
I do. Yes, I definitely do. 
1) Fantastic! He is an amazing technical actor as well, because he's directed episodes of MAD MEN, so he has an understanding of the technical side that most actors couldn't dream of. And he's incredibly generous and funny as well, and I saw him actually not long ago, we had dinner in London. 2) You know what, I'm ashamed to say I don't know that show, and I will go look at it immediately! So thank you for the recommendation! 
*YEAH.*I love that show. 
Um... I suppose the worst thing is that because I was a child actor, you get a lot of questions about like, you know, you get a lot of, for a while is that child actors were perceived as bratty and obnoxious, so you come up against that quite a bit. And the best thing, is, obviously, being mistaken for Elijah Wood. 
No, I haven't. There was one yesterday, actually, and I'm here. You know, I love the NFL, and I'm actually from London, so I feel like I am *the* exact target audience for the proposed London NFL team, and yet even I think it's a ridiculous idea, like the idea that American players would be forced to play for a London team which they wouldn't have the same amount of, you know, pride in playing for is a very odd thing. I want to see LOADS of NFL, I love they do games at Wembley, but a London team is, I think, a bit odd to me. 
Yeah! The Shining is probably my favourite, and Straw Dogs, and tell you what, just because it has a nostalgic place in my heart - ANACONDA. 
Um, I am much more of like a sports gamer. So I love the Madden games, all the NFL stuff, boxing games, Fifa a bit, but I also love Call of Duty. I can get lost on that for a few hours. But yeah, I'm not very good at video games. I tend to play them to the point where - I think the reason I like sports games is because there are no levels to get through, because i always reach a point on other games where I can't get any further, and it's not fun anymore, so that's when I ditch them and go back to playing Madden. 
Oh.I think, again, and I'm sorry, it's like the third time I've referenced it in this AMA, but I would go with The Master and Margarita, because it has never been done as well as it could be, so I am hoping I will meet that eccentric billionaire at some point. 
Dog. Very, very firmly in the dog camp here. 
Yes, of course, absolutely, God! I think that was part of the huge success of those books, is that it taps into a set of powers and a fantasy world that literally *everybody* would love to be a part of. I think I would be a fantastic one if I were really one in real life. I think I would probably be, like, one of the cool Dark Arts teachers. There weren't very many good ones, but I would be the Lupin equivalent. 
Um, I don't really drink much tea! If I do, it's with a little bit of milk and no sugar. But in terms of breakfast... I mean, um, my ideal breakfast would probably be eggs benedict with a large bowl of cereal brand - it's stuff called CrunchyNut, yeah, which you *can* get in America, but you really have to search for it, but it's an English cereal, and it's the best. With milk, oh yeah. No fruit, don't be silly. Just basically eggs, bacon, bread and cereal in any form is my ideal breakfast. 
Um... I would say: Oooh! I would say a few different types of cheese, maybe like, a gruyere in there, with some cheddar as well, you have to have some meat, if it's not bacon it should be Parma ham or something like that, maybe a few different types of ham, in fact, and then ideally some sort of brioche-bun thing... some sort of brioche-y type bread would be ideal. TOASTED! Toasted, absolutely! It's all got to be melting into each other. 
I mean, that is actually very difficult.I would probably try and fight the huge duck. Because I think that I could sort of... try, if I could break it, then I could have the giant duck as my steed! So I think i'd go for that, because 100 tiny Elijahs, they are going to be very hard to control, I feel like that would be the last scene out of Toy Soldiers or something like that. 
I would definitely say a wolf. 100%. I've been obsessed with them since I was very young, yeah. A grey wolf, to be specific. 
That's wonderful, and I love you too, but we should probably see other people. 
Originality... wit... a good moment of transformation, if you would have it, for a character in some way so the character isn't the same at the end of the story as he was in the beginning, it could be anything like that, or the story itself, it's all those things you're looking for! It could be the director you're doing the movie with, or people you are going to be working with, those are all things you factor in when deciding what you're going to be doing next. 
Despite being English, I am not, I'm afraid. It just passed me by. It was never one of the things I was into as a kid. So I'm sorry, Who fans. 
Nothing, actually. I didn't! I just got up and started doing interviews. 
I read Alan's diary, and just tried to watch as many interviews with him as I could. But because I was playing him at 17, there wasn't any footage of him at that point. So the diary was really the most helpful resource as to who he was. 
It will depend (unfortunately, because i might be starting a job in November) - I would love to be able to keep this facial hair for as long as I can, but it's always work depending! And I don't want to make a promise to charity and then welch to charity. But one year I hope to do it, and raise funds with a proper Movember! 
Hehe!*YES,* you should.Personally, you know, I would - I'm biased, because I don't like looking at pictures of my young self, like other people looking at their young selves, so you can skip the first few if you want, but I think they started to get really really good. I would say watch them, but you know, I'm biased. 
He's actually answered this before.  In twenty years or so, he suggested James Potter.  For decades later, he suggested Dumbledore.
\#dantheman
Production Assistant here. I would really like that.
Who doesn't want to work with Jennifer Lawrence?
> I imagine they are all at the home where actor owls retire to. Assisted Living Tree-hole.
Best book ever. Bulgakov is a genius. Read his play Days of the Turbins! 
I think you would make a damn fine Han Solo
Your dad really is James Potter!?!?
ahahaha what the fuck did you come here just to talk about tamales?
you should've kept the sword too
Just don't let your soul upload to iCloud or everyone will have it...
He wasn't acting.
The Thick of It is so great, and it lets you watch the newest Doctor Who with such a delightfully different view of Peter Capaldi.
As much as I liked all the films, Dumbledore was never quite right after Richard Harris died.
The internet is dark and full of terror.
Isn't that exactly what the Weasleys do in the books? Collect all sorts of weird muggle things?
Seeing you as a villain would be excellent! It's always fun to see someone  you've always viewed as a heroic character play a completely different persona. Off the top of my head, seeing Benedict Cumberbatch go from Sherlock to Khan was really cool.
Don't worry, the Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
Let's do this!
Settle down M Night Shyamalan
Or The Good Son but with more mystery.
Because you haven't set up a Kickstarter campaign yet silly!
He sounds a lot like Aaron Paul.
>liven everything upI see what you did there. 
Taylor Swift?
"Woah, an Elijah Wood AMA. I loved him in Harry Potter"
So yeah, the fact that they are happy is awesome!
"Because my life is dope, and I do dope shit."
> side with the StarksOh you poor dear.
And I suppose I should use this an opportunity to thank whomever made that particular meme, because it really is very good. 
It changed a lot of people's lives. Thanks mate.
wow, he's JUST LIKE ME!
Oh my God, can we get him to play a role? Could he be, like, Charlie's British cousin who does even dirtier work for even less money, but people think it's charming in Philly because he has a British accent?
I hope Elijah Woods says the best thing about being him is being mistaken for you!!
So I'm assuming you're a fan of Nicki Minaj's version as well, right?
**Sales of Bulgakov's *The Master and Margarita* Skyrocket After Daniel Radcliffe's Reddit AMA**
"No fruit, don't be silly." You are my kinda guy, Dan.
You always give the most enthusiastic, genuine, just-a-bit-kooky answers. I kind of hero-worship you.
Your references are out of control.
Y'er a lizard, Danny.
I have never seen you give an insincere answer in an interview, even if it would be easier to lie! Cheers.
Don't worry! I've caught up since, it's fine. 
Damn, guess I should start keeping a diary if I ever want to be accurately portrayed.*Dear diary, today I was devilishly handsome and every joke I told went over to screaming applause."
Don't skip the first few! They were such a huge part of my teenage years,  I don't think I've met someone who hasn't seen at least one.
Two creams, two sugars
Apple, apparently.
right next to the farm that all dogs go to so they can run and run and run...forever...
That would just make him Elijah Wood in which case they would still want an autograph
Have you seen The Young Doctor's Notebook miniseries, starring...Daniel Radcliffe? Haven't seen much publicity for it, but it's quite good, if rather... bloody.
Fun fact: The movie *The Woman in Black* that Daniel stars in is a remake. And, in the original one, the guy who plays the character that Daniel plays in the remake was the guy who plays James Potter in the HP movies!
Its never the wrong time to talk about tamales
And Hegwig
Firebolt or GTFO
Or *do* upload it, so you'll have infinite backup horcruxes.
    Sudo rm -rf /Soul 
And Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg!
Then why do I never hear about Ron?
he's got a tinfoil pal and he's fucking fucked his fucking sister
I always felt like the second Dumbledore gave off a vibe as though he'd quit smoking cigarettes that morning and was sorely regretting it by the afternoon. 
With Alan Rickman on the Azkabanjo?
In the original draft of Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Harry rode Arthur's bewitched llamas to Hogwarts when they missed the train.
and Mark Hamill being The Joker on the Batman cartoons
Not slytherin eh? Better be....slytherin!!!!
Pretty sure that was a given even before this response.
*An* asteroid, Mr. President.
They actually filmed all of Peeves's parts. Rik Mayall was going to play him. He was actually super excited about it, and then they phoned him like "yeah we've cut you out of the movie". It's so sad now because Rik died suddenly very recently. He was only 56. I wish they'd release the footage of him as Peeves, if they still have it. It would be lovely to see.
Or could there be a film where one of us, is like, an impersonator of the other? We've got to eke out some mileage out of this mistaken identity!
Go fund yourself.
A Daniel Radcliffe impression of Jim Ross would be pretty awesome...
It's like the entire timbre of his voice changed to go with it.
Tom Lehrer ain't dead yet!
I encompass and eclipse... ^hic
anyone not getting the reference, this is Dave Chappelle on Kanye West when they first met.
What's the current market rate for one Daniel Radcliffe? 
Yeah, but this is the boy who *lived.*
Well, if the internet has taught me anything, 100s of people will take credit for creating this meme.And on that note, I was the creator...
Listen, Harry Potter has come unstuck in time. The time-turner fucked up.
I would like to see Daniel be a bit like a british cricket that they all try to fuck over, but he fucks them all over as usual. And then steals their stuff or something. And bangs the waitress too!
It's my birthday so I took the day off
I don't get this reference, but you're having an upvote anyway since my name is Daniel and my wife (who slaps my ass to no end) is named Tina.
Her stepdaughter? 
Which he would sign "I'm not Elijah Wood, \- Daniel Radcliffe"
That is a fun fact!
**" I AM HARRY POTTER"**
And my axe!!! Oops, wrong movie.
Best horcrux:1. Take nude selfie2. Make it your horcrux3. Upload to iCloud4. Set an utterly moronic password, like abc1235. Enjoy immortality
And is impossible to destroy.  Brilliant.
And John Cena and Potato Salad!
There'll be online competitions where you can give your view of who is playing the part right throughout the various scenes.Just for shits and giggles they should also reshoot the movie with the other actor doing the scene, and the dvds will have a random combination of scenes
He's great in Galaxy Quest. 
He should have gone full snape"...hilarious."
That giggle holy shit. Hehehehehe!
you mean Snape and the Azkaband
Like you need an excuse.
For those not familiar with the vagueries of Reddit, this means Victoria from Reddit is either in the room with or on the phone with Daniel and is transcribing his answers.
This would be so much better. Right up until the llamas get beaten into a bloody pulp by the Whomping Willow.
First lesson: You can't always get what you want. Deal with it, Potter.
Yeah, they even made Rupert Grint head boy.
Not that weird, George RR Martin has even said that there is a guy that knows more about his books than he does himself and sometimes he even calls him up to factcheck when he's writing just to make sure he doesn't make any mistakes.
*dumbledore falls off tower*GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! HE KILLED HIM! AS MERLIN AS MY WITNESS, HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!
It's just an unflattering shot. Nobody looks normal mid-dumble.
Oh shit you're right.
Didn't know the vice president of Microsoft was an actor
I thought that was Kanye West on Kanye West, in the presence of Dave Chappelle.
27 Rupert Grints. (Or .006 Emma Watsons)
He could at least make it to book 5.
yes me too
Haha this is from "Bob's Burgers."  Tina, one of the daughters, is obsessed with boys and says stuff like this all the time.  Have an upvote on me as well
I think he's bored with Earth
Eleiaja Wood. 
**"AND I WILL FUCKING BRING THIS RING TO MOUNT DOOM**"
No, no, he was in Lord of the Rings, remember? He was that hobbit with the ring.
Remind me to change the combination on my luggage.
What's the John Cena and Potato Salad thing? I am aware of the respective subreddits but what's the story behind that 
And Russell Crowe and Gerard Butler
And the DVD will be randomized each time you watch it.\*FTFY.
It's weird but when people mention Alan Rickman, the very first thing that pops in my head, just the initial mental picture, is him as Hans Gruber in Die Hard
"Playing tricks again, ***Potter***?"
"Oldman, you gotta earn your way into this industry, you gotta do your time.  Just wait, it'll come.""*I DID MY WAITING!*""Look, dude-""*12 YEARS OF IT!  IN AZKABAND!*"
daniel's not typing his answers?
"CAAAAAARLLLL!!!!"
>*dumbledore falls off tower*RKO! RKO OUTTA NOWHERE!
DAMMIT! DAMN VOLDEMORT STRAIGHT TO HELL!
There it is. 
He's branched out quite a bit since he launched Android. 
Thanks Dadcliffe
**"YOU'VE GOT MY LIGHTSABER"**
Arry no curly hair *wagging finger*
Who IS this 4Chan?
Change the combination on your luggage.
This is getting expensive
Don't let Broadway fool you though. He also owns a hovercraft and an ice cream truck that he stocks and gives away for free to children.
I immediately think of him as Metatron in Dogma."Or you'll do what exactly? Hit me that ffffffffish?"
No, he is not. Though anything posted here is exactly what he says
Well, I flew to hogwarts... and then I landed in a tree... and then the tree started beating me up... so I stabbed it 37 times in the chest.CAAAAAAARL
"... It's like he looks more like me than... me!"
Read your comment before clicking on that link, I spent way too long trying to figure out which one was Michael Cera.
This would be sooo much better if it were JR saying it, instead of that jabroni, Michael Cole.
This insult doesn't even make me madcliffe.
And Rupert Grint's Hovercraft.
The true chosen one: Neville Longbottom.
Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a not so silent guardian. A watchful protector.
/r/toosoon
Adolf Hitler and Charlie Chaplin
Now, if he were to combine the two...
"Ill cut your heart out with a spoon!"
He's also incredibly funny and nice. 
That kills trees."Oh, I didn't know that. I suck"
Me too, I was like, "That's an interesting artistic choice to go with a separate person instead of technology for a double. This is the best makeup prosthetic I've ever seen on a face, and I can't believe the difference it makes when Michael tries putting on an impersonation instead of being himself. It's masterful!"
Now this pun thread is just sadcliffe.
That's not how this works! That's not how any of this works!
Pretty sure resurrecting the dead is cheaper than Crowe+Butler.
It's become a common fadcliffe
