Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. If you can't donate blood, think about donating food and drinks.  
Thank you for this. My sister is a critical care nurse at ormc and she lives only a few miles from Pulse. The day they worked today was long and the days to come will be too. My sister just wants everyone to know that ormc is a level one trauma center for a reason, and they were prepared for handling tragedy like this, and she is glad for it. Hearing from her about surgeries in hallways gave me chills. I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking of them. Also tijuana flats gave them all dinner so they've got that going for them, which is nice. 
That must have been incredibly tragic. I hope you're doing well.  
I'm so sorry please let us know when you hear something  
Correct, I believe he will speak at 1:30 eastern time.  
Yes! Not only blood, but these centers need water bottles and snacks as well for the large influx of people donating blood. Random acts of pizza is an amazing thing to do right now if you can't donate blood.  
Donation centers are at capacity for the day, but they're asking everyone to donate as the week goes on.  
It's so weird how one little decision can mean life or death 
I live right down the street from the club myself, absolutely crazy, I'm glad your friend is safe. 
I live in Tampa and my girlfriend and I recently went to Pride. It terrifies me that these places we have deemed safe, to escape from the homophobia and intolerance, have been targeted in such a specific way as to scare us from some of the only places we found acceptance in. What if it were here, an hour away? What if my gf and I had gone out last night, and ended up in the same situation? All because of who we love. I know everyone says to stay strong and don't have fear or change your ways of living, but maybe I'm not that strong. Maybe this shit shakes me to the core. A calculated, homophobic, hateful attack on innocent people who just want to be accepted for who they are.  
An off-duty officer was working in the club, exchanged gunfire with the suspect when he began shooting on the main floor at approx 2 AM.   Two additional officers responded, initiating the hostage-taking and subsequent standoff.  
As an American who is appalled by this type of violence, thank you. I am terrible sorry for your lose and about what happened in Paris.  
If he is actually a member of ISIS, then the bastard gets what he wants. The greater the divide between ordinary Muslims and the West, the better for ISIS.  If he is just some moronic idiot who hated gays, then yes he is just some incompetent evil idiot. 
Honestly, 60% of the comments are about /r/news. Let's get more discussions about the actual situation. 
Pride month has always been a bleak reminder (Stonewall), but I do agree, so many years later to have this time punctuated by this event is heartbreaking.    
Probably is. How many times has he had to make the same speech during his presidency? Gotta get disheartening  
While your statement is correct, this is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S., ever. 
Facebook has a cool safety check feature that can tell you if your friends have marked themselves "safe". It might be worth checking out if you have people you haven't heard from.  
The Encyclopaedia Galactica exists in both Foundation and Hitchhikers.  
Jesus, Christ- that's brilliant. Some kind of literacy push. I'll wait until the discussion rounds out some more, see what kind of things people are fiending for, and then if try and take a step forward with it.  
As much as it pains me to say it, I don't think that's such a far stretch.    *Mr. Grey flashed me the whip handle from the belt of his uniform and grinned. "Won't you join me in the gaming room, Ms. Steele?*  *The nerve! "Heavens, no. That would be terribly improprietous, Mr. Grey, and I intend to maintain my ladyhood."*  *"Very well, my lady. I shall call on you again, when you are feeling less proprietous and more inclined to adventure," Mr Grey smirked, sending a flush through my cheeks!*  *I would feel no such thing! Why must Mr. Grey infuriate and excite me so?* 
"To whom it may concern: It is springtime. It is late afternoon."   [DIES] 
My pleasure- your suggestion rocks. It made me think of another: Salman Rushdie writes the Twilight Series. 
As the twelfth toll of the dilapidated clock on the wall outside his cell marked the first hour of his eleventh year, young Harold Potter sat upright in his nightclothes.  Eyes wide and soaked through with sweat he tried to burn the gibbering pnakotic half-things that haunted his dreams of late away by lighting the only candle his captors allowed.  His labored breathing slowed as the flickering light danced on the wall of the space beneath the stairs at 4 privet drive.   The solace of the dancing shadows would prove to be fleeting however, as it was only mere hours before the winged harbinger of magicks beyond description arrived, screeching and flapping, and marking the end of youthful innocence and the dark shapes and mutterings of a child's ignorant nightmares.  After this day, the visions that haunted Potter's sleep would coalesce into a singular, tangible horror that ubeknownst to him, had on one occasion already almost taken his life... 
Until:   *At which point Mercutio exclaimed "thou a poperin pear!", a phrase which here means...* 
That's amazing.   Unrelated, but I'm curious about your r/username. Schlitz the beer? 
I'd read anything Terry did a "cover" of....which actually is pretty much what half his Discworld books are really, just covers of famous stories 
A lot of weird sex shit is going to be going down on that boat. 
I'm having this problem where I've either yet to read a work by the author, or I've yet to read the novel mentioned in each author-novel pair in just about every single comment, and I'm feeling irrationally pissed off  
Oh man, the body horror possibilities of Greek mythology! 
how about Mark Z. Danielewski taking on Calvin and Hobbes 
Yes I just re-listened to his dark materials my god it's a breathtaking and intricate series.   To piggy back, I would want Phillip Pullman to write a series on dumbledors life from grindlevold to Harry.  Dumbledor had that rich deepeness that I think Pullman could capture.  
Saruman's point of view is featured in a couple of chapters and you actually kind of agree with him. 
Book 1: The Pernicious Praetorians  Book 2: The Baseless Barbarians  Book 3: The Conniving Christians  Book 4: The Embarrassing Emperors  Book 5: The Scrambled Split  Book 6: The Grave Goths  Book 7: The Petrifying Plagues  Book 8: The Blighted Byzantines  Book 9: The Vicious Vandals  Book 10: The Contemptible Crusades  Book 11: The Troubled Territories  Book 12: The Objectionable Ottomans  Book 13: The End 
I didn't realize how badly I need Margaret Atwood's version of the story of Lot until now.  
He'd take as long to write the book as Odysseus takes to get home.  
I actually kind of want to read Neil Gaiman's Hitchhiker's Guide.  
*Toy Story 2* is more of a Tolkien tale. In the first one they'd barely leave the Shire. 
"It was a lone tree burning on the desert. A heraldic tree that the passing storm had left afire. The solitary pilgrim drawn up before it had traveled far to be here and he knelt in the hot sand and held his numbed hands out while all about in that circle attended companies of lesser auxiliaries routed forth into the inordinate day, small owls that crouched silently and stood from foot to foot and tarantulas and solpugas and vinegarroons and the vicious mygale spiders and beaded lizards with mouths black as a chowdog's, deadly to man, and the little desert basilisks that jet blood from their eyes and the small sandvipers like seemly gods, silent and the same, in Jeda, in Babylon. A constellation of ignited eyes that edged the ring of light all bound in a precarious truce before this torch whose brightness had set back the stars in their sockets." **Blood Meridian** 
Can you write a whole book in 140 character chunks?  
That sort of exists. It's called *The Crystal Star*, was written by an author who'd done a lot of Star Trek novels before attempting a Star Wars one, and easily ranks up there as one of the absolute wierdest Star Wars stories. 
Wow, what's it like finding out he's gay just now? 
Love this movie! It was incredibly moving. I watched it the other day and was curious about the experiences of others and if they were able to relate. I probably should have worded the question differently...  
Ahh, that takes me back to the golden afternoons of my youth, where, as a just-blossoming maiden, I was enchanted by the smell of dicks floating intoxicatingly on summer breezes. 
Quite a few apparently, I've seen several posts purporting to be from blind people. Using text to speech and brail keyboards is the most common method  
I'm pretty sure it's a cultural trope that most people (men and women, gay and straight) prefer to close their eyes while kissing and turn the lights down (or even off) during sex. We might think we're all about visuals, but actually when it comes down to it, there's a lot more going on that we often don't think about. 
It's question i never knew i needed an answer too, and it has an answer that seems so obvious now 
I mean... It's kind of the same as asking how blind people could be attracted to women. Because they can't see doesn't mean they don't have a sex drive. 
If your a straight blind man, how do you know if your a tits or ass man? 
I love this movie! I watched it the other day and was very curious about the experiences of others and if they related to the movie. It was very moving.  
I also remember seeing an AskReddit about how blind people know they're done wiping.   My favorite answer was, "when it stops feeling greasy".   I can never not think that now.  
That's what happens when Gay is used as an umbrella term for both gays and lesbians. 
Good old basic steamed rice. The only thing added will be the food that you give. 
So I saw this and thought I'd sub in for our awesome friend here, since I just happened to haven some leftover rice for dinner.  Blue Moon beer - 9/10  Blue Moon over rice - 6/10  Taste isn't even that bad, but I made a serious miscalculation over the fact that the rice would warm up the beer. 
Considering he's 14 he's probably just annihilating his parents kitchen right now.  
I always loved eating rice so I wanted to know what would make it horrible! 
Hot dog: 8/10  Hot dog with rice in the bun: 8/10  This is pretty good, would reccomend for anyone wanting to try something different. 
For sure. Probably gonna go to the gym later and do a whole pushup then come eat more. 
I let my friend borrow my webcam for a while, but I might do a similar thread where I eat more foods over something else.   
Who cares if I get sick, I'm making people happy!  Strawberry jam: 9/10  Strawberry jam with rice: 8/10   It makes like a sweet layer on top of the rice it's actually pretty good. 
I don't need gold, just seeing others giving me an excuse to eat food is good enough (: 
I read this earlier and tried it out, I got to say it sweetened the rice and made it not too bad (: 
Hopefully you'll be able to catch the next time I do something like this! 
I had a 75 year old neighbor that I grew really close to.   She called me asking if I could help set her new tv up, then we tallked about music and movies, then she set up a weekly movie/music night and the neighborhood would get together to watch movies.  One day she came out sluggish and told me she had a cold and wanted to cancel movie night, then that night she fell and just like that couldn't walk anymore.   Ended up being parkinsons, and I had to watch her slowly lose any ability to speak or move while being completely conscious.  The last movie I watched with her was Ferris Bueller's Day Off.   That was a year ago and for some reason she has really been on my mind lately. Simply mowing the lawn for your neighbor probably makes her day. Its company.  
I'm not dying, that I know of, and only have had one health issue that's popped up a few times (spontaneous pneumothorax).  What you said is spot on though. People go through life like their jobs, possessions, and money are everything.  It's what it gets you that matters. Financial security is important, but beyond that, I don't care about my job.   Living your life is what matters, however you want to do it.   
I've got to say that this may not seem like much to you, but this offer is legitimately amazing.   I have a serious, long-term health condition that requires outpatient infusions every few weeks and if there's one thing that gets me through those days it's a good array of snacks. Don't get me wrong, quality reading material, some laptop or mobile games, and, when available, good company, all go a long way; but the snacks are critical to getting through the day. Especially when nausea starts to kick in or when the nausea goes away and it feels like I haven't eaten in years.    So, good on you for making this offer! It could be just what someone needs to get through what may otherwise feel like yet another shitty day.  
My sister has this.  She's doing a lot better than when she was first diagnosed but it was rough the first couple of years.  That is very nice of you to offer your support for those struggling with similar diseases.  
Take him anyway, even if the kid is in a carrier.  Let your Dad talk to him and tell him about fishing and show him things.  Record it with your phone and save a copy to your computer and keep it for when the kid gets older.   Learning those things from a Grandfather is just absolutely awesome, even if it is years after that time it actually happens.  Also, watching your Dad talk to your kid will be something special for you as well. 
It's good to accept it, with some things that's all you can do.   My mother also has severe cirrhosis of the liver and probably has a year or two left.  
This is a great idea! I'll look into the the 501(c)(3) requirements to create one. Anyone know what the best way to be visibility on this is? 
I've cried so much reading all these but yours has been my favorite comment cause it's real.  Humans are a fucked up bunch for sure.  I feel so guilty sometimes being an introverted single mom and letting my children play their video games and watch their YouTube videos while I read stuff on Reddit that makes me cry or photoshop my cats head onto my body.  We are all healthy and should be camping and playing laser tag, but in the end that's where we'd all rather be in those moments.  Then, I see something dumb like little brother opening the jelly jar for big man and my heart swells with love for them and life itself, just before we all part ways and do our own thing again.  Life is so weird.  
Let me chat with you a bit, yeah? I can actually help with this. PM me. Not kidding, man. I can get this done for you. 
I'm a mod at /r/redsox, I'll keep you in mind as sometimes last minute tickets show up on the sub. Do you live close to Fenway for short notice games or would you require some more advanced notice? Weekday vs. weekend games? 
That's why you should always dress nicely. You never know when you'll die unexpectedly and be stuck with that as your ghost outfit forever.

Do you think he'd like another tshirt? I live in Yorkshire, in the UK. I could send him a interesting one. I'm trying to find a reason to live at the moment. So anything I can do to help anyone. Please let me know. 
It depends. If it's old school chemo yeah it can be ugly. But there a lot better treatments now. They can analyze the cancer mutations and find the best chemo. If your cancer has a known mutation then targeted chemo can knock it out, or at least buy you a lot more time with possibly fewer side effects. More and more cancers are being treated this way everyday.  So at the very least, ask. Even get the biopsy/genetics done. Then the doc can tell you more.   
People will comb through comment history for sure, and if it's a throwaway (with an outrageous request) I'll probably be more cynical about it. 
I need something from you.  I need you to continue to be a good person. I need you to be kindness in a world that drowns out all the good and hope with the thunderous sound of artillery fire. I need you to be a beacon of solidarity, and to give something back to the world. We all know the planet is fucked as it is, but I need you to make it a better place. We all need to make it a better place.  I sincerely hope that you get out of this rough spot you mentioned. If there's anything I can do for you, even if it's just a quick chat, I'm only a PM away. Let me know.  ITT: me getting emotional 
Don't think that's needed mate, from the comments here I can safely say Reddit isn't that bad. 
I'm hoping they are all busy doing what they want to be doing! 
The Christmas tree is making me cry. Thank you for taking such loving care of your elder kitty. 
There are already a bunch of articles about this exact topic. From what I gather from a few of them, pollsters were thrown off by the voters who didn't want to admit they supported Trump (being called "Shy Trump" voters), and by the rural white folks who tend not to respond to pollsters' calls but turned out in huge numbers in this election.   I'm sure that this election will bring about a change in the pollster profession. Most of them got schooled yesterday.  
'Well there was this cartoon frog on the Internet...' 
I don't see anything changing after the GOP was rewarded for 6~ years of obstructionism... :/  Even if the Dems swing back into power in 2018 (highly unlikely), gridlock will be the new norm now that it's been proven to work. Politics above country. 
I'm surprised no one else really commented on this. He was really struggling at the end. I got the impression he really needed to go to the toilet too.  
If this really were the series finale of America, everyone would be pissed how unbelievable it is.

Back to the Future almost had it right. Cubs, off by 1 year. Looks like Biff did in fact get elected president!  
Given he's flipped flopped on TONS of social and political topics in the last few years, it's entirely possible.  
"I'm sorry, but you need ten years experience for this job starting out at minimum pay."  Fuck you, Trump is president despite never holding office in any other sense of the word. I can sit at this computer for eight hours just fine. 
I've never seen a more resounding "We don't like you".  
Half of the comments in this thread read like youtube comments.. I'm so irritated. 
It's not shocking at all to me.  As a bartender, there have been many a group discussion on politics while CNN played on the TVs.  Everyone would murmur how "both candidates suck" and how we're screwed.  However, once the crowds cleared and there was nothing left but one-on-one conversation with the guests and I, their pro-Trump colors would show. 
The "Western Spring". Hopefully doesn't go the same way the Arab spring went...

It's actually funnier now for the rest of the world.  
And both will be covered by Huffington Post in their entertainment section.  They said it themselves last year. 
i feel like a lot of trump support wasn't vocal about it because of being taboo in a lot of sense. but when it came to the poll they were free to vote how they really wanted 
That's the scary part to me too. Even if something were to happen and Trump were to step down, we would have *Pence,* who supports gay conversion therapy, very not pro choice, pro religion in government, etc. Trump is dangerous, but he seems to mostly want the title and the power to me, while Pence knows what he wants to do. 
I keep thinking Trump was selected as an easy candidate to be beaten by Clinton. Some people's plan got fucked hard. 
"My name is Barack Obama, and I'm the Presidentiest man alive." 
plus they can serve as makeshift blankets, which will come in handy 
It's only rigged when it might go against your choice. When it comes out in your favor, then it's only because the conspiracy failed to take hold.  
I think it has less to do with him simply being a Republican and the the fact that he's a severely under qualified reality TV personality. McCain for example, maybe you would greatly disagree with his views but at least he's a qualified, and overall decent person that can hold the position of President.  
And the best part is that it's 9/11 for most of the world. 
Honestly, he alone does not scare me. I don't think he even knows what he believes, he is incredibly wishy washy and rolls around in simplified rhetoric. However, the SCOTUS, the house and the senate are all aligned with a party I do not agree with on to many matters; And they may have more sway of the new president in matters than you would want in a leader.

New idea; hiring interviews in an escape-the-room puzzle. See how people function when challenged, under pressure, and not knowing explicitly what to do. 
This exact thing happened to our group in an escape room a few months ago.  I guess some of the people weren't listening in the beginning and missed that the box by the door was for our coats, purses, etc...  So about 5 minutes into the escape room, someone in our group drags out a purse, dumps it on the floor, and proceeds to go though the wallet.  At one point, he says loudly "hey, this wallet has a lot of money in it" and we all turned and saw what he was doing, including the owner of the purse.  She was horrified. 
I did one with hubby, both brother in laws and their partners. First time we had met one girlfriend but thought it was a good way to break the ice.   There was one prop which had clear plastic tubes with different directional arrows behind them. Eventually balls popped out of a tube in the ceiling and we realised these balls went into the tubes and the top directions were entered into a directional lock thing. So we entered this code 10+ times didn't work we were looking at this for a good 5 minutes until BILs girlfriend asked if 'we needed these' and pulled out 6 balls she had in her pocket?????.   We still managed to escape so we haven't held this against her. 
I can attest to this from the other side. When we went, my family including my mom and sister, brother-in-law and 15yo daughter and my eight year old, when we finally ran out of time the guy basically told us that my eight year old son had been on the right track and we would have found the exact missing clue that was stumping us the whole time if we had listened to him. I actually felt pretty bad about that, poor kid, but I also get to hear about it from him anytime that day is mentioned.  
That is amazing. Something similar happened in my last escape room experience. It was a space themed one, and at one point, you open this uplink and get into a crawl space. In it, there are numbers spelled out in Russian, and you're supposed to solve another puzzle to get a computer screen to show you the words and their meaning.   I was in the main room trying to figure out how to solve the final puzzle when I hear my friend shout "Wait, is that Russian? Yeyande, get in here!" we proceeded to skip a few steps in the room because I speak Russian.  When we finished, the game master was so confused and had never thought that something like that would ever happen. 
Take off clothes, get kicked out, room escaped. Winner!

I mean, that's understandable. Sucks for your friend though! 
Nobody had ever tried which option? Because I probably wouldn't think to look across the street.  Also wow, that's early for a bible study, but I guess there's a lot of material to go over. 
Oh man. Imagine breaking up in a room you can't get out of, then having to work together to solve puzzles to get away from each other. Was it fun to watch? This will be the plot of a rom-com in 6 months 
When I played, our train of logic  pointed to taking apart a hanging light.   The people knocked on the door loudly and told us not to dismantle live electronics.  
"And next time, it won't just be the furniture we rearrange." (Cannot find the relevant Far Side comic - but that is what this reminded me of) 
More of these places should have people fixing their own destructiveness afterwards (when they're breaking rules given to them prior)  
That is so hilarious, like what good could it do to drink it when you can just pour it out.  
Wow and I thought the world was running out of heroes.  
Hey guys its me, Laronge again. Need anything? Moist towlette? Ok I'll be back to check on you in 30 sec. 
Not really for free if the company's selection process sucks that way. 
Can't even tell those guys to get a room, they're already in one. 
The only thing I've ever heard measured in racks are ribs but somehow I imagine you mean beer? 
Um. Was he an employee or not? Cause I'm thinking it wasn't 
"I shot the escape room operators and kicked the door open, i'm so cool" 
I always imagine that the people observing are continuously make bets on what the people do. 
Yeah that's always a bummer - It'll be two people, just the couple. Only the guy is completely freaking out the whole time about having to pop the question at the end, so, the girl ends up dragging the guy through the whole thing, doing all the work - Or, worse, we give them all the answers after an hour of standing around - All to reveal this ring at the perfect moment, only, that moment is completely ruined by this newfound perspective you have on your fiance, as this completely bumbling idiot who didn't solve one fucking puzzle the whole time  
It took me a really fucking long time to realize that the person was not speaking to jesus about his job interview where engineers throw bikes down and tops off 
A farmer and his dog are herding sheep. They finish and his dog says "I counted 40 sheep". The farmer replies, "OH SH*T A TALKING DOG".  
I've heard this one as, "What did the tie say to the hat? You go on ahead, I'll hang around." 
I told my girlfriend she penciled in her eyebrows too high.   She looked surprised. 
The absolute MOST important part of this joke is to take a massive breath before the second whale speaks, like you're about to go off again 
What did the grape say when it got stepped on? Nothing, it just let out a little wine. 
Man, I just tried to go tell my wife this joke and I couldn't get past knock knock because I was laughing too hard.  Well done! 
A young priest just out of the seminary is on his way to his assignment at a church in the bad part of town. He walks past a hooker who say, "Hey father, blowjob? Ten dollars."  The priest shyly hurries away from the hooker and makes his way to the church. He meets the Mother Superior who proceeds to tell him what his duties were to be and where his room would be in the rectory.  Finally she's asks him if he has any questions.  The young priest says, "Mother Superior, what's a blow job?"  She replies "Ten dollars, same as on the street." 
What did the doctor say to the dwarf in his waiting room?   You're just going to have to be a little patient 
Mickey Mouse wakes up one winter morning to find that someone has written "Fuck You Mickey" in the snow on his lawn with piss. It happens multiple times each with worse messages.  Mickey calls the police who start investigating and after a few days the detective comes to Mickey and says "well I have good news and bad news"  'What's the good news?' Mickey asks  "We ran a bunch of tests and found that the urine belongs to Donald Duck!"  'Well that's great, but what's the bad news?'  "Forensics has confirmed that the handwriting belongs to Minnie." 
Two snakes are hanging out, when one asks the other, "Hey, are we venomous?"    The other snake replies, "I'm not sure."   "Well I hope not," the first snake says, "because I just bit my tongue."

How do you spot a blind guy at a nude beach?  It's not hard.  -  You know what they say about those blind prostitutes - you gotta hand it to them. 
Did you hear about the restaurant on the moon? The food is incredible but the atmosphere is lacking. 
While we're doing priest jokes... (I'm ignorant of Catholicism and only loosely remember this one, so please excuse me.)  A teenage boy is doing his weekly confession at a small-town church. "Father, forgive me, for I have had carnal relations with a young woman out of wedlock," he confesses.  The priest, like all small-town folk, is a little nosey. "Was it Barbara who works at the Baskin Robbins?" he asks.  "No, Father," replies the boy.  "Well was it Janice, the coroner's daughter?"  "No, Father," the boy says.  "Hmmm... well was it Mary-Beth, the florist's assistant?"  "No, Father. I don't want to sin again by damaging the girl's reputation."  "I understand, son. Off you go." The priest gives the boy his penance and sends him on his way.  Outside, the boy rejoins a group of friends who have been waiting for him, a huge grin on his face.  "Well, what did you get?" they ask.  "Five Hail Marys and three good leads!" 
lol  -is how I imagine what that hippie looked when he was trying to get the lifeguard's attention. 
A young monk joins a monastery and is told he must take a vow of silence, but as repayment he will be allowed to speak two words every ten years.  Ten years pass and the head monk asks him if he has anything to say.  "Bed Hard".  The senior monk nods and sends him on his way.  Ten years later he goes before the head monk.  "Food Cold".  Again, the head monk nods and sends him on his way.  Ten years later: "I Quit".  "Well I can't say it's surprising, you've done nothing but complain since you got here."

In a similar vein, three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "Do you all want beers?" The first one says, "I don't know." The second one says, "I don't know," and the third one says, "Yes!" 
You get an up vote because I love me a good historical joke.  
Patient:  "Doctor! Doctor!  Is it possible that I caught VD in a pubic restroom?" Doctor:  "Yes, so i would recommend you stop fucking in there." 
Why don't seagulls fly over the bay? Cause then they'd be bagels 
You know why when ducks fly in a v one side is longer than the other?  Because there are more ducks on that side. 
I've heard this one enough that I just lay in with a real knock knock joke when someone tries this.  
Why did the French cook kill himself?  He lost the huile d'olive. 
You just wanted to post this, didn't you. I'M ONTO YOU, OP! 
Did anyone else point out that alcohol is a solution yet 
I heard this joke before with an uncle who was a school bus driver. A bit darker than your version. 
What did the pirate say when he turned eighty?  I'm eighty. 
I've always thought this joke is much funnier if it doesn't explain itself. "One day my grandfather said to me, 'Your generation relies too much on technology!' So I unplugged his life support." 
"Why do elephants paint their toenails red?"  "idk"  "To hide in cherry trees."  "haha yeah right"  "Have you ever seen an elephant in a cherry tree?"  "no"  "Works, doesn't it?" 
A man and a boy are walking thru the woods at night. The boy starts crying.  "Why are you crying?" " It's dark here. I'm scared" "You're scared? I have to walk back alone!"  
I like the Transformers version.   I met a woman at a bar and took her home. She asked me why I always had a gun on my hip. I told her it was, "for those damn Decepticons." She laughed. I laughed. The toaster laughed. I shot the toaster.  
Leper jokes are great.   Why did they stop the Leper hockey game?  There was a face off in the corner 
Why are blonde jokes all one liners? They have to be short enough for men to remember.   
Alternatively...  A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Would you like a drink?" The horse responds, "I think not," and vanishes.  Those who are familiar with philosophy should get that this joke is poking fun at Descartes, who famously said, "I think, therefore I am." However, I didn't tell you the explanation before, because that would've been putting Descartes before the horse. 
In most of the world, fairy tales begin with, "Once upon a time..." In Louisiana they begin with, "First you make a roux..."  
Alternate version:  A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar. The barman says "is this some kind of joke?"  Though I'd actually use "Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman" as that's more common in the UK. 
Where did Hitler keep his toesies? In his shoesies.  How did Hitler keep his shoesies on? With little knotsies.  Where did Hitler keep his armies? Poland.

Oh my god that's amazing. What a total tool. You were super nice to him, MAN that would burn me up so bad it'd be hard for me to even finish the interview. 
That was one very good reptilian dog you had there.  Did you catch the guy? 
I had good friend, when I was in primary school who had a step dad I really couldn't stand. He was quite a bit older than her mom and very strict. I even avoided to go to her place, when he was there. Later she told me that he beat her and her brother quite regularly. 
"Maybe it's because he was a 35 year old man who wore visors."  Funniest thing I've read this year 
The amount of pedophile stories in this thread is freaking me out. 
Similarly: I got some really weird vibes from my high school-age group Sunday school teacher. He was also a church elder, was on the town council, and was a bigwig at some computer tech company, and so on. I was never really comfortable being alone with him. His wife seemed to be crawling out of her own skin when she was around him. Always bossing her around and telling her to shut up in front of people.  Fast forward many years later: He was arrested and convicted of raping young teenage boys, age 14 or so. I was the same age range as the boys he raped at the time he was committing these acts. Dodged a bullet myself..... 
It's interesting, I think we (women) generally try to repress those feelings towards other women who appear to be friendly--even though we're getting a weird vibe.  We sort tell ourselves it's us, not them.  And then, turns out, it's them. 
Your cupcake statement reminded me of my friends bf who came to my house for the first time,to meet me and take her home. I had a pack of those mini cupcakes on my stove. He proceeds to open the top of the package,while not saying anything,touches the tops of all the cupcakes..(me and my friend are both shocked and can only stare in amazement) he then asks if he can have one... I snap out of it and tell him he can have them all,now he's touch EVERY SINGLE FUCKING CUPCAKE!!!! He leave shortly after eating all the cupcakes...I have never spoken to him again...fuck him for touching my cupcakes. Also for the record,she broke up with him shortly after,because only psychopaths touch other people's cupcakes... 
So he walked into the shower with a bunch of naked girls? And no one else thought it was strange? 
Yo momma so fat, she survived and lives a happy life! 
Your grandma sounds awesome. Leaping over furniture and escaping from a murderer.  
I've known some pathological liars and they always have a way of explaining why they work a mundane job when they're  (every one that I'd run into, so far) rich or very well-off.   One said he won the lottery and was worth about 40 million, but worked a regular job to keep from being bored. There was no winner when he said he had won, and he wasn't smart enough to go through an attorney.  Another claimed he was worth just under a million and he owned a modded BMW M5 but drove his brother's Mazda to work, claiming it was to help his brother out by loaning him the M5. He also claimed to work his shitty $10/hr job as a way to keep busy most days. 
I want to meet your sister and find out about myself. 
How horrifying. I went to high school with a girl who was a pathological liar (but didn't make paranormal claims) & this girl did so much meth during her pregnancy her baby died soon after birth. I always wonder why she was so messed up. 
The assistant pastor at my parents church always gave me the creeps, couldn't quite place my finger on it since he never did anything particularly creepy, he just looked like he had something to hide. A few years later, he was arrested for upskirting young girls at the mall. No telling what else he was doing too.   This was a decade ago, dunno if counseling worked for him or anything but I haven't seen him pop up on the news at all.  
"You're just jealous you're not hot enough to get hit on by a creepy teacher" that sounds like many of the popular girls in my high school & middle school. I wonder how they felt when he got caught. Keep trusting your gut!  
It's not often you hear about people still having contact with their first girlfriends - at least, I know more stories in which people don't stay in contact rather than they do. May I ask, how much time is in between you and her breaking up, and them getting married?   It may be a bit of an offtopic question in this topic but I'm genuinely interested.  
A girl I know is doing this. All my friends love her but something in my gut told me something wasn't right. She was always flirting with all the lads, acting very single. Find out she's seeing a guy I know from other friends. Not only that, it turns out she also has another boyfriend she's had for years. So she has a long term boyfriend, is seeing this other guy, and is by all means, trying to get with my friends too. Was very surreal. But I was just jealous of her when I didn't warm to her straight away like everyone else.  
My sister's class at school had a competition to write to him to get on to his Jim'll Fix It show. She was picked, and she really really wanted to do the thing she wrote about. But she completely refused to go to the show because she said he was creepy. She got in a tonne of trouble at school because of it, but I guess that was better than what could have happened.  
This sounds like high school. Please be high school. 
I have a friend who has high functioning Aspergers. Unfortunately for him he loves people, craves social settings, and has a fear of being left out. Of course, most people instantly don't like him and won't give him a chance, which leads to a lack of social life and missing out.   He is definitely (as you put it) creepy, but not a creep.   Actually a pretty top bloke most of the time, been his friend for like 5 or 6 years since high-school. Will bend over backwards to help most people in any way he can. Even paid the rego on my first car, and loaned me the money for a new PC (I'm fucking poor as shit, he is insanely frugal - partially thanks to a lack of friends), both of which I'm now working off for him.  
I dated a guy that everyone thought was the greatest, and by all accounts, seemed to be. But my kids really didn't like him and my brother described him "as super mild mannered but the kind of guy that comes home one day and just murders his entire family" The relationship didn't last because of these reasons as well as my own but, as of 2 years, he's still just a great guy as far as everyone knows. Now it has me thinking.  
Very creepy! My brother was an anxiety sleep walker in during his freshman year in college. He would wake up in different places in the dorm and one night his roommate, who he had just met, woke up to my brothwr standing over his bed. The guy transfered schools shortly after.  My brother is a totally normal guy and hasn't had any sleepwalking episodes since. 
That's a really compassionate way of seeing the North Korea situation 
Have parents who grew up in Korea, I'd definitely say that they have more resentment towards Japan than NK. I'd have to ask them, but they seem to be more sympathetic towards NK, especially since many have relatives there.  
It is due to the isolation and difference in North Korean language and culture in comparison to the South I believe.  60 Years of total separation has its affects. 
Damn, this post was moving.  Especially that you were taught that you're brothers and sisters, and "Koreans" meaning "one people"   We're all brothers and sisters, when you think about it. It's a shame that the whole world wants to alienate us from each other. 
For those who don't know, the show got its name from the way our devices resemble black mirrors when they aren't active / with their screen(s) locked. 
I saw that as a 14 year old kid in the late 80s.    Shat me right up it was so plausible. 
The set and palette colour were very unsettling. All that grey and green and emptiness made me feel uneasy.  
There are a few jump scares, but in the context of Jacob's Ladder they don't seem cheap and they are legitimately unsettling. 
The book is like that as well. Even when she's being "sweet" you're on edge because you know she'll change in a snap. Such a haunting book. Need to see the movie. 
Eraserhead just confused the fuck out of me. I would go so far to say that I am still confused three years later.  
Talk about a movie that's hard to watch again... just because of the sense of impending dread.  You just feel greasy watching that movie. 
Ted Levine was so crazy as Buffalo Bill it really makes you wonder if it impacted his personal life. If he wasn't married at the time it must have been tough getting a date.  Who wants to date the guy who played Buffalo Bill.  
And now that guy is The Flash. What were they thinking? Giving Kevin powers like that. 
Ok I literally just said the big jump scare in The Thing was the best of all time. But I take it back. The one in The Descent is the best of all time. It was literally the climax of the movie.  
Oh man, I forgot about that movie!!! Mothman Prophecies scared the shit out of me as a teen, and then they casually add that it's based on real events? I just wanted to get that movie the fuck away from me forever. I gotta watch it again and see what I think of it now.  
The bathtub old woman is still one of the scariest things I've ever seen. That and the typewriter scene, which is one of the most clever and iconic horror movie scenes ever I reckon. 
God damn, the rape scene in that movie will never leave me. 
To be fair, I can think of at least one jump scare in that movie.  [Specifically, when the cop is hovering over the junkie's face and he wakes up](/spoiler) 
The one part of that movie that always gets me in the last session tape where the doctor asks "Where do you live, Simon?" and the response is "I live in the weak and the wounded." 35 years old making my husband check under the goddamn bed and shit... 
One of the most grusome movie deaths Ive ever seen is from Bone Tomahawk 
I don't find movies like this scary. I'm not on edge or afraid just disgusted and sad. 
I was so afraid during that movie that i honestly felt like i would die if i didn't stop watching it.  So i had to finish it the next night. 
You should absolutely check out Perfect Blue, the film that Black Swan was heavily inspired by. 
When you casually find all of your missing friend's teeth in a baggie... Yeah, love that film 
You sound like an idiot describing the premise to someone. "Oh yeah it's a monster that comes after you but they'll go after someone else if you fuck them." Huh? But it's probably my all time favorite horror movie. It matched so perfectly what I find scary about dreams. The whole thing felt like all my worst nightmares.  
I saw this movie on the last day it was in the theatre. I was the only one in there. I knew nothing about it. I just assumed the footage was real.   At the end, I was so terrified that aliens were real that I sat in the parking lot on Google for 20 minutes making sure that movie was fake.   I'm a grown ass man, and I don't scare easily (or much at all, really). To this day, I have tricked 4 of my friends into watching it with the pretense that the footage is real. 2 of my friends - also grown ass men - had nightmares.   Good times.  
I'm forever torn on the ending.  On one hand, it was powerful, bold, and *really* sticks with you.  Like, forever.  On the other hand, it's *really* sticks with you.  Like, forever. 
I really liked this movie, just saw it recently.  Great atmosphere, great period acting. 
I was skimming this thread HOPING someone would mention Signs. I have never been so terrified. I actually have chills reading the scene you mentioned because THAT was the one that took me over the damn edge. I absolutely love that movie, but hell if I'm ever going to watch it again. My family loves teasing me with it though. "Don't look in the pantry, Father...." nope nope nope nope nope!  
I was going to write this. I watched that while working an overnight and at three in the morning the disturbed feeling was super super real. That movie is eerie as fuck and way scarier than any slasher film I've seen. I really like how he starts out being portrayed as sort of socially clueless and intense but just driven for success. I sort of wrote off some of his creepy behavior as him being socially inept. As the movie went on I realized he knew *exactly* what he was doing and just didn't have empathy or care. It was a terrifying crescendo. It's one of my favorite movies that I'll only watch once. 
"Why are you doing this to us?"  "Because you were home"  *shudders* 
To be fair, he said without resorting to jumpscares and this one is pretty jumpscare heavy. Still uses them well though.  
individuals, maybe they would think it's odd after a couple days. But having that translate to a global understanding and acceptance is unfathomable. 
You think this is funny but there are like 10 people with bleeding noses reading this and freaking out 
Good in theory, but as a nurse most people in the hospital aren't really sneezing. My thinking is that a day care worker or elementary school teacher might notice it first. Or someone with a severe allergy to cats or something.

I sneezed this afternoon, so we're probably good.   For now... 
That'd be good. At the end all of the soldiers put their weapons down as a sneezing man comes staggering out of the building. They weep. 
This was my first interpretation of the question as well. You've got that tickle in your nose, but your body is powerless to take care of it. Your eyes are watering, your sinuses are stinging, every breath you take leads to a tiny prickle of pain... I think we'd notice pretty quickly. 
I would realize pretty quickly because of this. With all the snow reflecting the sun in my face I'd be the savior who figures it out. 
I am right there with you. Fuckin love it. Especially when you sneeze like 5 times in succession and your eyes water and your nose just goes numb, like you didn't even have one.  
I wish! At least once a year I have a horribly painful hiccuping episode 
- Updated localization files  someone please get the reference 
Same deal here. First time I walk out on a bright day, I'd know. 
I'd say with social media and people writing about anything, it wouldn't take so long before it gets in the news. I'd say a week or 2.  I can picture a bunch of people on twitter or facebook: "Wow fantastic, I haven't sneeze in days" Then slowly they would notice each other's comments. Then some not so important blogger would write about it. Then more and more important blogs would, then celebrities would come forward. And Bam! People listen to celebrities's shit. News start talking about it and people get scared.   Studies starts around the world. 
I can just imagine telling my grandkids about the golden sneezing days of yore. 
He probably thought you were going for his cheek and missed.  
God... in middle school me and my best friend watched Scrubs all the time. We'd do a Todd high five in the hallways whenever we'd see each other, and one time the girl I had a crush on put up her hand like she wanted a five, so I smacked her hand as hard as I could and snapped... turns out she was waving to her friend behind me. I had forgotten until your comment..  
He and I could be friends. How can you pass up an empty pool cannon ball?! 
Speaking from experience, odds are he probably got hurt a lot in life. I've had people flirt with me as a joke (and I knew it was a joke because she'd rejoin her friends, point, & laugh). That kind of treatment can build up and really damage your confidence and self-esteem. 
I had exactly this happen, but it was at my place. Eventually walked her down to her car at 2am and she turned around to give me a hug, but I was standing like five feet back by the curb waving goodbye. I knew I fucked up as these things were occurring, but that didn't stop me from fucking it up. 
I've been the guy in this situation more than once... I might be an idiot... 
The only hint that is actually foolproof. Well done. 
To be honest, I'd think you were kidding unless I was your SO. It would be too awkward to walk in on you showering and be wrong.  
I think some cases is about low selfsteem right? I used to talk with a girl online every day. And one day she told me      "I love you".      And I thought "no way someone can love ME", so I asked her      "Is it a joke?"      "Yes"      And then I thought "wait what if she is serious"      "are you sure?"      "yes, it was a joke"      Now I think maybe she felt I rejected her so she just make a save. 
I don't get it, who's that Matt? (not joking....please explain) 
I'm ashamed to admit I did something very similar to the eye thing 
My wife was very direct. Fuck me if I am wrong but do you wanna fuck.  
Honestly, I would probably do this just because I hate my landlord 
Jamie: I'm gonna fuck my sister.   Avameow: Sooooo, you in the mood? 
I thought the dogs were in your living room for a minute and was confused. See what happens! 
She meant DnD, and was disappointed when you pulled out that weak shit 
You: *post a photo of you pet doing something silly*  Him: "Hey remember that time you let me touch your boobs?" 
The arm thing is too subtle tbh. It could just be you being clumsy. Yesterday a girl I was sitting next to touched my arm three times in about a minute and the first two I thought might have been on accident, but the third time I said "what's up?" And she said that it was an accident. So yeah :/ 
I am so glad I read these posts when they come up every few weeks. The other week I had friends over and a friend of a friend lingered saying she was too drunk to go home. I offered her the couch and she replied "where's your room?" All of these posts flashed through my mind as I tried to figure out if it was a hint or not.   Long story short, went for it. Got laid. Thanks, reddit!  
Sometimes Netflix and chill just means Netflix and chill... Doesn't it? ...Shit! 
I dunno man. I had a lady friend visit me in a different country while I was working abroad, share a bed with me for two weeks, and practically act like a wife with me. I told her I was into her and when I directly asked her if there was anything going on between us she said no.  
Nah, she doesn't think you're stupid. She's disappointed, but people are pretty familiar with the dangers of dipping your pen in company ink.   You're not an idiot. The opposite really. Just keep her in mind if either of you leaves the company!  
It's ok...I can literally invite my husband to get in the tub with me, and he doesn't get it. Sigh.. 
...poor girl, that's like the ultimate rejection. JFC man 
A girl in college asked me to study with her at her apt. At some point, she brought up PornHub and pulled it up on her computer. She said, "Omg! all these girls have weird nipples! Like who has nipples like that?!" I was confused af because I thought they were just normal. A few minutes later, I was like "ooh! Let me show you some of my favorite videos" She got super pissed at me and started calling me a creep. I got pretty defensive and eventually went home. Years later I realized that she was trying to show me her boobs..... 
What was he so engrossed in? Video game? Newspaper? 
You got zucced. But the only thing that got wet were your eyes.  
Fire is much more effective at keeping warmth than cuddles. That man's a keeper. 
My wife and I have worked out a code phrase, for when one of us isn't picking up on the obvious signals. We say, "Howdy partner."  It's a quote from Shanghai Noon, and it works like a charm. 
If that was me, I'd have thought you were being sincere when you said you hate the thought of ending the streak. 
also as a guy, its hard to tell to what extent that hint goes  from a simple "i think you're a cool person and we should be friends"  to a "you're pretty attractive and i wouldn't be opposed to having a relationship"  to "perform intercourse with me"  to "im being polite and keeping the party vibes up, but to be honest I am indifferent to you."  its hard man. i can barely read books  
You find her and you explain it, you dense mother fucker. I NEED CLOSURE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU. 
If I were in your shoes:  "No thanks. I only wank during the afternoon" 
Have you ever known a guy who assumes every girl is into him? Like a girl looks at him when trying to get around him and he thinks she was checking him out? No one wants to be that guy. 
Something VERY similar happened to me when I was a nanny. I dove over the island in the kitchen to slam my laptop shut to prevent kids from snooping. I then password protected my laptop.  
After my little girl's mum and I split up and I had her most of the time, being an apprentice with stupid amounts of bills I'd only normally cook dinner for my little girl (then 2) and I'd eat what she didn't. One night we had chicken bits I think? And I had a few and after I'd finish mine I looked at her eating hers and smiled at her, and she put some of hers onto my plate. I said " no you eat them" and she insisted. "You sure little bug?" (what I call her) and she said " yes! You are my daddy!!"  I almost cried. Makes my heart melt 
I watched my own vasectomy, it was interesting.  I was more concerned about the nurse...who I  went to high school with and hadn't seen since. It was a bit awkward.  
My MIL passed away suddenly a few years back and I ended up being the one to go through her things for donations because my husband and SIL were too emotional. I found 2 whole drawers of sex toys and homemade porn that went straight into a trash bag and into the dumpster. Never told my husband.    
It amazes me how often people forward an email without checking the chain first. We've lost customers before because someone sent them an email not realising it'd been internal for a while and had all sorts of 'not for external consumption' content.  Once it was just pricing information that showed we were charging a big margin on work for them, another time is was a straight insult.  As the IT manager I get those questions like "can we stop it?" with such desperation in their eyes I feel bad telling them it's too late. 
At first I thought they were just super chill and open about this whole thing. Like I imagined it was 10am and you were helping a customer find some Code Geass manga and they just wanted everyone to check out their work.  
lol when my dad was in the US Army in the 60s he was stationed in Germany for a year and on more than one occasion they'd load up a missile in to the back of his truck and he'd drive it by himself to another part of the Country. All he had was a sidearm. I think security was really lax back then.  Fun fact, he learned to drive in Germany in the US Army. Didn't have a drivers license or anything. They just handed him keys and he started driving around. He was irritated when he eventually got back to the States after a few years deployed and had to take the drivers test. 
When I read this, I thought of a chemistry teacher for some reason, didn't realize it was alcohol until I read the thread.  
i have never understood how you get a woman to fuck in the back of a van(excluding that pair in california). 
So I'm assuming as an 8 or 9 year old, you didn't know it was weed.. so when did you figure it out exactly?  *15 years later, in bed sleeping...*  You: . . .  You: . . .  You: . . *WAKES UP* IT WAS POT 
She could have been saying "it would fucking suck if I framed you as a serial cheater" 
When I was, I don't know, 6? I awoke to my mother trying to sneak a few dollars under my pillow. I then realized the tooth fairy was fake. I got SO MAD at her. I think I said "You've been lying to me for my whole life!" and didn't speak to her for a whole day.   Still believed in Santa though. Of course he was real!    
Please tell me that they are on different sides of the family 
"Damnit Britney, your sex doll cost us *another* sale! 
You and your friend were going to take a dump together. Damn. Friendship goals. 
You know, my first thought is they were smoking pot or doing lines or something, or even simply sneaking cigarettes. Seems way more plausible she would risk doing drugs/smoking with a friend -which presumably all the adults there would be cool with and merely hiding it from the kiddos- than two adults fucking with their spouses and children all downstairs *and* you not overhearing a single moan or grunt.  Not calling you a liar or anything, just thinking from our adult perspective. There's more grown ups do in secret than bone. 
Sex in the outdoors is awesome, just don't forget the blanket. 
I saw my dads successful hanging at three years old. That shit screws you up for life 
He wanted you to find it, so you could get a raise. What a bro! 
I found my mom's vibrator as a kid. She told me it was a neck massager. I still cringe everytime I remember this memory.   Btw, worst neck massager ever.  
My parents never allowed me to watch Ed Edd and Eddy. They said bad words like "stupid". 
14 is a very specific number.  No more, no less? Exactly 14?   I have to wonder, how did she establish that it was 14.  Did he admit to 14, which would make the number suspicious.  Or did she find credit card evidence of 14 transactions at 'Happy Hands Massage Studio.'  Or what?    Wow, I'm way too curious.  I'm sorry you had to see those notes.  
Similar story: once I came home late at night when everyone else was asleep. My cat was sitting on the chair on the porch and there were about 5 or 6 strange cats sitting in the porch or the steps, all facing him. I watched for a moment and they seemed totally relaxed, all sitting with neutral body language. I took a step forward, they heard me and scattered in an instant, and my cat calmly asked to be let inside.   He was fat, irritable, and a badass killer. I from then on assumed him to be some sort of cat mafioso. Happened in NJ btw.  
I have a similar experience where my mom refused to admit that Santa wasn't real. She had made the "To:" and "From:" labels on her computer to avoid us comparing "Santa's" handwriting to hers, but she accidentally left the program up when we came down the next morning. She insisted that Santa had used her computer.  
Man...I remember emptying my mom's purse out on her bed one time when I was a kid, and some condoms fell out. I'm being inquisitive, asking her what they are, I probably opened one? idk. Anyways, she claims they're balloons. And blows one up and ties it off. And that's how I got a balloon one summer day. 
I smoke cigarettes and it seems like the two coolest things in this thread were seen while people were having a light, but the coolest thing I've seen while smoking was two hobos fighting 
That's when you show him some nudes of your girlfriend so it won't be awkward 
Well, thanks for giving all of us that mental image, I guess 
Dude, same here. I was too young to know just how low that number was but I knew it wasn't much. Thinking back, I have no idea how they fed and clothed three kids with that. Oh wait, I do. It's called credit card debt.  
This reminded me of the time I pulled off some mission impossible level shit (at least to teenage me) with my dad.  I put the slightest amount of some face cream I found in the bathroom -- not oily, but left the faintest residue -- on the TV remote buttons, and got him to put in his pin # to unlock his blocked channels on the cable box for me.  I could see his fingerprints on the buttons and later while unsupervised, used that to figure out his code. 
You are not alone. I found out at the age of 20. My mom had started working night shift. My dad would be on his phone constantly, one night he came home and talked to someone all the way through dinner. I don't know if he thought I couldn't hear his headphones or what.   One evening I went to use my parents bathroom and saw my dads phone open to a message. It said something along the lines of "I miss you so much" but wasn't my moms name.   I'm the one who had to tell my mom. Had to hold her has she cried and had to face my dad when he came home. I thought he was going to hit me. I locked myself in my room for days. Only to come out when he was at work.   They stayed together... I never had the same relationship with my father. Went to therapy for months.  
Similarly, Chris Pratt placed an order with us and i have his gmail address. i actually had looked the order up when i was investigating fraudulent purchases. People put in fake names sometimes. Sure enough, the address the package was going to was some huge mansion place so i deemed it not fraud.   The email address is actually kind of funny, I'm sure he made it himself. No, I won't give it to any of you so don't ask.    
That's some Jason Bourne level shit for a middle schooler. 
To think bank robbers in movies lay these really elaborate plans to get into vaults, and then it turns out they could just go in early and see the combination for themselves 
That sounds exactly how my mom died.   Staring up still me, then looking up beyond me, focused on something that only she could see.   And then, the life left her and I could see that...like a light turning off. 
For some reason I absolutely think Ted Kennedy was f'ing with your teacher...totally a planned joke to freak out your teacher... I grew up with a very Irish Dad..the bullshit never ends 
Usually? So this was a habitual thing, and you didn't make a point to avoid it? 
We need a follow up. Does your mother know it happened? 
I looked it up. It wants me to confirm my city, with the only option being Detroit. Then it asks for my email. No explanation or details are given. I'm too scared to proceed any further. 
this one's kinda cute and not completely horrible compared to the others in this thread.  the same thing happened to me when I woke up when my dad was putting coins under my pillowcase and taking the teeth for the tooth fairy away. 
When locals in Mexico tell you a place is dangerous, you BETTER fucking listen to them! 
Who has sex in their parents house with an unlocked door?!?! That's protocol number 1 for sex in the folks house rookie!!!!!! 
Nowadays you can just search on Goggle for nip slips. 
For the sake of my own sanity I'm choosing not to believe this. 
Hahahaha that's fantastic. Teach you to accelerate your child learning!  
Just curious. Did he actually ever mention anything like that to you or was this entirely something rabdom you decided to say? 
dicks are dicks, but the porn u end up at towards the end of a session... thats private! 
One thing I've learned is if it were socially acceptable, a large percentage of woman would prefer to be naked pretty much all the time.  They probably would too if it weren't for all us men trying to mate with them. 
i think it would be harder to explain why they're smiling as if for a photoshoot while being double penatrated.  
Special effects existed before Photoshop. A lot of the things you can do in photoshop have manual, physical analogues in film effects. 
If he says humbled twice in the same sentence, you have to snort it off a buddy's cock 
You could be drinking watered down hard lemonades and this game would still kill you.  
I'm preemptively cringing at the thought of him doing this.  
Whenever Trump says something you agree with, drink.  It's only as dangerous as the rules make it. 
And instead of Simba, Joe Biden comes back in several years and fights Trump atop the burning White House.  
If you watched the RNC acceptance speech that's actually what he did. No idea if he actually wrote it or not, but if you want a preview go look it up, it was not the same as one of his rally speeches at all.  Also a pitcher of beer isn't very much, it's like 3 and a half beers. I thought we were trying to get drunk here? 
I have been doing thaqw scnce the ellctionnn...  Me poore livverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 
For glorious orator, how do we know what's tangent and what's speech?  
he uses the word "very" more than an elementary schooler who hasn't learned enough adjectives 
Also pro tip: if you're underage, we all know that's never stopped you before. Knock yourself out.  
Or, if you can and want to, peacefully protest. A lot of cities will have small rallies and gatherings.  
'Tis the season to get air in your Anus from too much anal 
I'm in the same boat. I did hang an Xmas wreath on my front door.  This has been an absolute sucky year, made a gazillion times worse because my 12 yr-old dog died in August. He was the family I celebrated with. 
I work in hospitality. You'd be surprised how many women in our restaurants freak the fuck out when Mariah Carey's "all I want for Christmas is you" comes on. It's alarming the screams from the grown women everywhere.  
Also working! Apparently people still expect an ambulance to come on holidays.. 
Holy fuck. I just went bankrupt a few minutes ago. I feel you dude.  
If you're both on the lease she still owes you for half the rent. You can sue her for what you've paid so far and any other costs associated I wth the eviction.  Small claims court. Check out r/legaladvice.   
Parents just divorced, at my grandparents house watching elf for the 70th time with my sister, love the holidays! 
Look at Mr. Fancypants here flying one hour instead of driving. 
I'm still struggling with my soon to be ex wife's affair, the holidays are tough. It's been 4 years since I found out and everything fell apart and I'm still a wreck. If you need someone to talk to I'm here to listen, trust me you need to let it out or the holidays will fucking kill you. 
If I may ask, what does your wife think about it. If that was my mom, she would have gotten in their faces to tell them to stop with the bullshit and get them both something or neither of them. 
It's only 7:52 PM Christmas Eve here. Trying to get your presents early you time traveling piece of shit? 
Your day sounds like a great independent movie I'd put on a list to see once it hits the shitty cinema in my town which it never will so I'll forget about it until I see it on Netflix four years later after scrolling through my suggestions for half an hour. 
Sounds like your folks are thought poisoned. Sucks for them to miss out on a cool kid and awesome memories... I wish you Happy Holidays and huge successes in 2017.  
My family is content to sit in the couch together and say nothing. We're doing it now, it's great. 
I'm sorry to hear. I used to think I had a mood disorder and my depression was my fault. Come to find out my emotional issues were a result of narcissistic abuse by several family members. Cut that family off and life is amazing now.  I don't know your situation but hang in there. Keep searching for answers. I hope you enjoy your Christmas Eve. 
God damn, I wish I had a compound. Or at the least a barbed wire fence around my house. 
Just remember, they're no longer the wet bandits, they're the sticky bandits. 
Haha this is why I cannot study or write while listening to music or TV. My papers will just be full of lyrics and dialog I heard. 
similar thing happened to me: I was calling my internet provider and hung up saying "love you, bye" 
This made me laugh, cos SO & I respond to most of each other's questions (about anything) with "in your butt". I may change it up & borrow yours.  
I did this. Moved 1 door down, but I never even spoke to the new occupants of the old place. Just barged in one day coming back from the laundry room with my laundry basket and there's a shirtless dude laying on the couch, probably high as a kite. We just stare at each other for a minute and I say "I used to live here!" and started walking out as he was laughing. 
On a similar note, I did park maintenance for awhile and often entered the opposite sex bathroom to clean. I have found myself yelling "FEMALE MAINTENANCE WORKER!" before entering the ladies room 
What did you do with the beer and why is the answer you chugged it? 
Been giggling like mad at all the stories, but yours? yours pushed me over the edge. I think My laughing just woke up the neighborhood.. 
Thank you for the diabolical idea of how to get rid of telemarketers!  
"Here's your cheesestick, hun!"  *daughter cries*  "why don't you love me?" 
Story kind of related to your #1...  At the end of an evening scout meeting, we were playing Sharks and Minnows across the grass when this one kid runs to the end, trips, and hits his head on the sidewalk at the end of the field.  We help him up, ask him if he's okay, he insists that he's fine. His injury ends the game, so we all head back into the auditorium to close the meeting. After a solid 5 minutes of announcements and flags, we're sitting and chatting on the edge of the stage.  The kid who fell suddenly looks at me with a really confused look on his face. He had been functioning fairly normally, yet he **had no recollection of the past 10 minutes** - from the moment he hit his head until then. That freaked me out... 
Imagine you pick up someone elses signal with the baby monitor and start hearing voices in your car.  
I once poured the fresh grounds into the basket before placing the filter in. Upon realizing my mistake, I emptied and cleaned the basket and then placed the filter in its rightful place. Then I poured the water in and hit brew.  Fifteen minutes later, I had a full pot of hot water.  Not a good morning. 
The other day I was checking in at an amusement park. After the guy scanned my ticket, I, for some unknown reason, held out my hand. And the guy handed me his scanner.  
You can lead a horse to your kitchen, but you can't make it cook you breakfast. 
Haha I've done that.  I was walking through town with my gf at the time, looking at stalls and shops and she was in my periphery, or so I thought... She had stopped to look at something else and a woman of roughly the same height and hair colour was stood next to me.  I checked my phone for time, gently caressed her shoulders and said "come on now, it's time for us to head off". And just walked away from this woman.  I turned around a few meters later to see my gf a luminescent shade of embarrassed and this entirely freaked out little old Asian woman. 
I had to go to Walmart once after finishing my midnight cashier shift from a competing grocery retailer across the street. I absentmindedly grabbed my stuff, approached the cashier and asked her if she found everything ok. We stared at each other blankly for a little bit. 
I was writing a practice essay for the SATs to turn in for class, and I must have dozed off or something while writing it, because the word "pineapple" was circled in the middle of my essay with a question mark written next to it.   The essay had nothing to do with pineapples. or fruit. or even food. I had no recollection of writing it, and when my teacher asked me about it, I honestly had no explanation.   The sentence must have gone something like:   ".... The mind is too important Pineapple of a thing to waste and therefor should be fostered..."   The word didn't even make sense in the context of the sentence I was writing.  
I wish that's how it always worked. If so, I'd be showing up at work in the middle of the night like every single day  
Yeap. The amount of times I've ended a phone conversation with, "Okay, love you, bye," that wasn't with my husband/mom/dad/brothers on the other end is embarassing. 
What did you used to do at the airport? I think airports are interesting 
I did something like that when I was like 8. My dad was in the car getting ready to take me and my brother to the game room, and I didn't want to miss out so I ran to the car without pants on. Then I hear my mom yelling out the window, "YOU HAVE NO PANTS ON!" 
I was making breakfast one early morning and cracked my eggs straight into the garbage. 
The trick to this is owning it. Put a lot of energy into it, frantically wave your hand, maybe throw in an enthusiastic "ooh, ooh!" Your friends/coworkers will respect the fact you are being ironic. 
Every year I have a day or two where my first period learns something a bit wrong because my brain isn't working. I usually hope they're not paying too much attention and try to reteach it the next day.  
I have done this. Instead of grabbing my coffee, I got my tv remote and didn't notice until I got to work haha  
Once I was feeding my 1 year old a banana and talking to my mom. In the middle of the conversation, I pushed the banana in front of my moms face and just waited for her to take a bite. It took like 30 seconds to register that I was force feeding my 48 year old mother NOT my toddler. It was hilarious.  
My boyfriend tried to wake me up from a nap and he started tickling me and I started freaking out and getting scared because I thought he was a wire stabbing into me and I was a mountain?  
i was really hoping it was the other way around :( 
It's better than looking for your glasses while you're wearing them. Not my proudest moment... 
That reminds me of my coworker at einstein bagels. We would call out customer names, hand them their order, and wish them a good day. He said   "Have a great job" and on another day "happy birthday"  
Have done, but with just two.   First egg: "oh, dammit!" *Rinses egg down sink*  Second egg: "oh...oh, fucking come on" 
Sometimes I wake wake-up at like 6 AM thinking I'm late to HS and rush to get out of bed.   Those were dark times.  
Most people are kidding when they tell Jesus to take the wheel 
Poor food  Why didnt you help it  YOU COULD HAVE SAVED THE FOOD 
"If you're here.. then THAT means.. uh oh!"  (Cut to someone rubbing the rat on corn on the cob)  
You reminded me of my favorite one! I kick my truck door closed all the time.  One time, I kicked it closed before grabbing my phone, and in a sleepy panic *threw my keys into the truck just before the door closed.*  I was so out of it I yelled "Yes!" because my sleep addled brain must have thought that was awesome.  Had to wait for my wife to get home to open the door to the house to get the spare. 
Could be worse. Your hair could be unprotected from 99% of odor causing bacteria.  
Ah crap something similar happened to me. I got to a party and saw people I knew, mostly female, so I gave them all a hug and a small peck on the cheek, get to the one guy in the group, both of us bearded men and proceeded to give him a peck on the cheek. We both just stopped and stared at each other.  
Fortunately cats have an ATTACK setting to protect against such mishaps. 
I can't stop giggling at the moo cows, now *I* look crazy 
I've peed on the lid before because I had expected it to be up, and didn't realize before peeing. Not a good time.  
Yeah... they probably didn't need the pee to know if you were on drugs after that. 
Ha, I've done this at work. The woman on the other end just laughed and said "Love you too" and hung up. 
This needs to be higher, I can't stop laughing. That is 1,000,000x worse than calling a teacher "Mum"  It reminds me of a time during a Japanese language class where my teacher was a very masculine woman who had a pretty deep voice. She was super nice mostly considering this was a grade 8 language class where nobody particularly cared and got pretty rowdy. In a moment of autopilot, I wanted to ask her a question and out came: "Hey Dad." I felt so bad about it. 
I had this happen to me. I had procrastinated on a film study project, started working on it at 8pm the night before it was due, made it about 1/2 of the way through by midnight, and woke up in my bed at 5:30am to go to school with no recollection of anything after midnight. I was freaking out thinking I still had four hours of work to do to finish, but checked the document and it was *done*. Last saved at 3am. I got an A on a project that I barely remembered doing, and I had done the second half *faster* than when I was conscious. 
Not gonna lie, this one took me a bit to understand. Maybe I should go to bed before I put my phone in the trash. 
My daughter has always been a little helper.    Once, I was folding towels and putting them aside so I could put them away later.  Little daughter had just learned how to walk independently. She grabbed a towel and walked toward the bathroom to put it away.  I told her "Put it on the toilet".  The cabinet was right above the toilet. She came back all happy, once she had completed her task.   A few minutes later, I went into the bathroom with more towels.  I put them away, and then realized there was no towel on the toilet. I looked around for a few minutes.  Then, I lifted the lid on the toilet.   There was the missing towel.  I guess my daughter had not understood the difference between "on" and "in".  Or, the lid was up when she got there, she put the towel in the toilet, and then helpfully closed the lid.   My daughter is now 17, and I never let her forget this. 
I've tried to put milk in the cabinet where the cereal goes a bunch of times.  I've even tried to put the box of cereal in the fridge.  
Sounds like you forgot more than just her password.  
Why would you eat a stray mint that had just been in your pocket for months anyway?  It would be all covered in lint and gross. 
I often rest my hand on my thigh and play with the seam on my jeans when I'm sat down, one time last week I realise I can't feel my hand on my thigh. Turns out I'd been feeling up my friend's thigh for a good 10 seconds before either of us registered what was going on. 
Did you owe yourself money? Send a little message to that deadbeat? 
I can't work out where the hell your brain was going with this. 
We drink maple syrup for breakfast in Canada anyway. 
Try retracing your steps. I do that too and it's probably increased my success rate to 3/10 
Never pulled that one but I did freak out and start yelling once when I  got up to take a piss at night and couldn't find my pistol or holster. 
Friend of mine saw Robin on a red eye flight, but he was sitting across the aisle from them and was apparently asleep. They spent a good portion of the flight going back and forth about whether it was him, when he suddenly turned to them, smiled, and said "Yes, it's really me." Made small talk for a minute and went back to sleep. 
What do you call a man with his arm up a horse's ass?    An Amish Mechanic    Nanu Nanu 
It's not insignificant. It meant the world to you when it happened and still means something today. That story truly shows they type of person he was(its hard to use past tense with him). He brought humor with him everywhere. I actually got a visual of him with a huge backpack and smiled. 
Robin Williams could find humor in anything. With that being said, I love how this sentimental piece was written by /u/SHITS_ON_CATS.  
Spoken like someone who's struggled with depression. 
"Carpe, carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary." 
I have been depressed lately, so the other day I went on Netflix looking for a movie to cheer me up. I ended up watching The Birdcage, even though I have seen it several times before. I picked it because I loved Robin Williams and he has never failed to make me laugh. I feel so honestly sad that there was no one and nothing to cheer him when he most needed it. I feel like one of the brightest lights in the universe just winked out and the world just got a little bit darker. 
It seems to me that the most successful comedians always have an intimate understanding of how life can make jokes out of us. 
That is who I want to be. A person like Robin Williams. That person that waits patiently and makes everyone feel as though they are worth listening to. I wish I could have met the man. God knows I need someone like him in my life right now. Really, I think everyone does. That's why his death was so jarring. Today was the moment when everyone collectively realized he was the kind of person we all needed to keep the world going. But we always realize these things too late. 
According to his publicist he had been struggling with depression. 
LOL! My friend and his wife saw him somewhere in Napa Valley some years ago. They were driving down the road and saw this extremely hairy guy (no shirt) riding a bike down the road.  My friend commented it looked like a gorilla on a bike. As they approached and were next to the cyclist, lo and behold...it was Robin Williams! They shouted and waived at him and he smiled and waived back. I think they took pics, but I will have to reach out to a friend that I haven't spoken to in many years.  
You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you'll win, no matter what the outcome. 
"We are willing to help, Lord, but what, if anything, is needed? For it is true we can seldom help those closest to us. Either we don't know what part of ourselves to give or, more often than not, the part we have to give is not wanted. And so it is those we live with and should know who elude us. But we can still love them - we can love completely without complete understanding."  -- Norman Maclean, A River Runs Through It and Other Stories  
Until we roll 5 or 8, Robin.  Until we roll 5 or 8... 
Now I understand Patton Oswalt's Tweet. Thank you. 
Eerily reminiscent of Oscar Wilde- "work is the curse of the drinking class."  
The thing is with Steve Irwin at least I could've expected to see him go in such a way. While tragic it was oddly fitting of him. But, I can't even imagine Robin Williams without a smile on his face much less depression and suicide. His death seems to hit something deeper because of how unexpected and unlike the image we all had of him.  
I don't think anyone could do it convincingly, this made me realize how one of a kind he truly was.  
My uncle saw him jogging in Hawaii--he yelled out, "That's Robin Williams!" Robin Williams heard him, turned around and screamed "Where!!!" Then continued on his run. 
They call the Magical Bum homeless. What they don't know? The world is his home. 
My sister and I both had this before. It is often unprovoked, and a rare occurrence. We just blink, and wham our vision is 20/20. Then we blink too soon and it's over.   I remember grocery shopping with my mother once when I was about 13, and I blinked and suddenly had perfect vision. I saw everything clearly and could read all the labeled sections in the back. I blinked and everything was blurry again. I was amazed and also extremely disappointed that it disappeared so quickly.  
He probably realized what it was and didn't want to get taken to crow court. 
Sounds like some messed up version of Over The Hedge 
Something similar happened to me. I was 5-6 and was playing outside with other kids. All of a sudden, those two cars stop by a sidewalk, they grab a girl on a tricycle and speed off. Only her bike was left. We ran to my mom to tell her someone got kidnapped. She was cooking, somewhat listened, nodded her head, smiled, "Oh, really?" and that was it. I think about it often.  
could have been the colour of your shirt as well.  i work at an aquarium, and as someone who wears the uniform, animals get thrilled at the sight of me often, just because of my shirt colour. 
Ball lightning lasts that long? I always assumed it just kinda came down from the sky and burst.  
I'm sure there is some scientific explanation to this, like the lizard went into suspended animation or something (which is weird because I've heard that chameleons are quite sensitive to temperature), but that being said...this is just bonkers.  
I saw the same thing! I told my dad and he looked at me like I was crazy :( 
Our house was struck by lightening one night and my mom says she saw a hovering ball of lightning. Apparently it's something that can happen. 
you witnessed the squirrel/cat nations summit meeting. several treaties came out of it 
You probably touched a Brugmansia. They are loaded with scopolamine and can cause you to see things that are not there. Inverse colors are a common hallucination from them. Brugmansia are a very common garden flower, despite their effects, because only small children will be effected by contact alone. Did you have big orange flowers that hang downwards in your garden? 
Was there a portapotty nearby? I bet that blue shit can dye mice too 
You should talk to the other guy with the post about doing his ashtray in the kitchen and never finding it even after a remodel 
I'm surprised he's not missing more than an eye. Abraham Lincoln has been dead for a very long time, he should be rotted to his bones.  
Wait what do you mean exactly? Like you fell in such a way that your pants slipped down and your back twisted over? Or you like, saw a vision of your buttcrack appear before you? 
Could have been a Will-O'-Wisp especially if it was over a lake. The theory is certain gases like methane and phosphine are either ignited by lightning or chemically react and release light creating what looks like a floating light. 
Funny enough, yesterday I was reading a thread about satellite TV. Back in the day, you could pick up the satellite feeds that broadcasters sent to local TV stations. Like, if NBC was covering a basketball game, they'd have a satellite truck set up at the arena beaming up to space. The satellite would then beam that down to Earth, so that your local NBC station could pick it up and transmit it across its broadcast area. It was up to your local station to then put in advertisements during breaks and whatnot.  However, if you had big dish satellite, you could sometimes pick up those raw feeds. Supposedly you'd end up hearing the commentators just BSing, the cameraman aiming at random things, etc. 
I was walking to class and passed by a trashcan with a domed lid. On top was a bottom piece of a bun. As was walking by it, a squirrel came out of the trash can and put a Chick-fil-A chicken on top of the bun, then went back inside the trashcan. I assume it was to get the top bun. I really wish I took a photo of it.  Another instance was a squirrel with a cigarette butt in its mouth. 
My mom used to see her dead sister standing at the end of her bed watching her for years after she killed herself. It was always peaceful and tranquil, she says. She liked seeing her. But then one night it just didn't feel right. My mom got scared and shouted for her to go away.   She never came back after that.  
As someone who lives in Asia. This isn't too hard to belive. 
The power to fuse and manipulate deli meats. Looks like X-Men is real and you are the Magneto of our reality. 
"no one will ever believe you."  - that guy, probably 
Once on a bus going to a Christian youth group event thing, a friend flashed a group of girls in a car we were passing.  5 minutes later they're passing us and flash us back.  Best youth group event ever. 
We (people in southern Appalachia) call that a Crow Court. I've seen it happen too, just with one in the middle. While it definitely does happen, apparently no-one knows why. We all know that corvids are crazy smart, so I think the idea of a Crow Court isn't far off. Maybe the crows in the middle did something to endanger the Murder, or they're sick or something. Either way it really is surreal 
That is neat. I can't come close, but, in around 2001 I was playing online poker (hold 'em) on dialup. I'd been dealt AK suited, played it moderate cool, then the flop came up giving me an instant royal flush. Immediately my connection dropped, and by the time I got back online I'd been timed out and we were on the next hand. It took all I could muster to not put my monitor through.  That was the end of online poker for me, but over the last sixteen years of casual kitchen table games I've never seen it since. 
A driver in my hometown (suburban NJ) saw a giraffe run across his path. He immediately pulled over for a cup of coffee, and told people he thought he was hallucinating. They tried to call him an ambulance, but then they saw police cars going by... turns out the circus was in town and had lost its giraffe.  
You obvious that you did not see any old businessman, but THE businessman from which all other businessmen are born. 
Investigate this! Surely theres a science subreddit who can explain?  
Yeah, sorry about that, I was pretty hammered so I had to take breaks every few minutes of flying. Thanks for not running over me or something. 
What the fuck Steve? You said you wouldn't tell... 
My mom was at my grandma's side when she died at home. Basically, breast cancer had run it's course and Grandma was sleeping most of the day, would wake up for a little bit here and there. Anyway, Mon was sitting next to her holding her hand and my mom swears Grandma woke up looked at my mom smiled looked at her feet eyes wide open mouth agape and looked back at mom and said it's beautiful isn't it? Laid her head back down closed her eyes and took her last breath.  
Some skinny, tall farmers feelings are hurt by this. *I'm not an alien guys!* 
They broadcast it live. I was 15 years old at the time, and we watched it in my high school. It's one of those things that defines my generation; We all watched Challenger explode when we were teenagers.  
Are you in North Kansas city? Theres a guy in my girlfriends neighborhood that dresses up in a civil war uniform 3 or so times a week and walks his dogs. We finally saw him walk past her house the other day. Very strange, we even Googled to see if there were any reenactments near by but found nothing. He's a doctor of some sort so I suppose he just has a passion or heavy interest in that sort of thing and has the money to make or buy those uniforms. 
It was the space shuttle. They used to land at (then) Kelly AFB. The first few times they were transported into hangers, then later landings were just left out so you could drive by on Military Drive and see them.  
That could've been the start to a real touching Rom-com or maybe even a drama, but you fucked it up.   
Maybe a water spout forming? That's is a super creepy story. 
I too recall having a shaking bed, as if someone was lifting the foot of the bed up and down aggressively.  It stopped around age 4. False childhood memories or dreams...maybe 
If a creepy TV ghost mouthed the word "Floppydlop," I would not stop laughing. 
Here in Japan there is an urban legend about human-faced dogs called "Jinmenken". They are said to appear running along highways at night and have the ability to talk. 
I've had similar experiences of this too, only with smells. My gran used to wear this cheap perfume that can only be described as old lady perfume. She was the only person I knew who wore it.                     I have moved house a lot since her passing, but every time we get moved in and semi-settled the smell of that perfume comes drifting through the house, my partner also smells it but he never knew my gran. I like to think she's just checking the place out and tutting to herself. 
This one I can imagine is legit. Just not real. I used to get very real hallucinations right as I was waking up. 99.9% of the time it was seeing a spider or spiders climb up a wall or across the ceiling. Like, huge spiders. Sometimes bigger than could ever exist in nature. I used to go literally flying out of the bed, scared outta my mind (huge arachnophobe). But then one day I stared at one, too afraid to move, and it slowly faded away as it crawled. Still happens once in a while now- I just ignore it until it goes away. Anyway, it seems very similar to what you described. 
My wife and I were in the dinning room and the dog was next to us hoping for scraps.  Then suddenly the bedroom door opened and slammed.  The dog immediately ran up the steps towards the door, just as I did.  I searched the upstairs thinking someone was in the house but no one was there.  What's interesting is we both (wife and I) heard the door knob turn as the door opened.    Clearly the dog heard it too.   It was also on a calm day, no wind and our house has no drafts.   
When my cousin died on christmas eve 2012 my aunt found a couple dimes at his crash site and now my whole family does this too. 
Most likely a penis that looked like snoop dog to be honest. 
Oh man I'd kill for an extra hour of ~~sleep~~ watching old tv show reruns and playing with my phone. 
It's not even one of the Tolkien languages people have heard of, so you get a useless L2 and a bunch of Tolkien nerds stalking you because you're the world expert on Avarin. 
He'd clean the entire house thoroughly, then take all of the trash, dust, and misplaced items he's collected and toss them all into one important room. It would probably be most effective in a bathroom or bedroom.   The genie could also "clean" the house of some things that would bother you if they went missing- batteries, some lightbulbs, a remote, maybe a door. 
I see a loophole here. Buy one of those two dollar toy cars, classify it as 'your car', trade that in for a 1986 Datsun, sell the 1986 Datsun, repeat, profit. 
what if you accidently rip off one of your nails? you're fucked dude.  
"Oh no, I can't find Spot!"  *Arf arf arf*  "Aw fuck..." 
Yes, but it still has the texture of ass and back hair. 
This reminds me of the "shitty super powers" game I used to play with my friends whenever we went to to all-night diner after a closing shift. My favorite one was telekinesis, but only within the context of making soup.  Other winners included: - creating sexual tension - always knowing how old a person is - being able to turn on lights with your mind, but not off again  
Would it also throw the smell? If so, I choose this one too. 
I did this today... I work in a oil refinery and they WILL NOT lemme in without my badge... And I forgot it... Had to drive 45 minutes home to get it and then 45 back... Lost $50.... :( 
But the catch is that they don't suck; they actually do blow. 
$500 is a life changing amount of money for me right now.  
I used to fantasise about having the power to know where every bit of dropped currency was in whatever city I was currently in. I would then realise I'd rather just have the power to give myself lots of money without having to walk around for it. 
Could substantially change your life, though.  You could use it to get laid a shitton, especially in tourist heavy areas.  You would speak the first language of every foreign girl in the bar.  That would be life-altering.  In more ways than one. 
What if you're in a room with the door closed and it's outside the room? 
Dump it into the self-checkout at your grocery store, or wherever. It'll take a few months to burn through that much change, but it's free, and using the self-checkout avoids the burning judgement of a minimum wage cashier. 
There's not always an arrow, sometimes it's just an icon on the dial.  AND ON MY PARENTS' 05 SUBURBAN, IT'S ON THE WRONG DAMN SIDE.  That is all. 
I had a professor in college who only owned black slacks, brown dress shoes and white button-up shirts (the kind that are formal, but don't have an actual collar, so no ties ever). He owned a lot of each (showed us a picture of his closet), but it was all the same outfit. Great, smart guy but you're right, he was SUPER cartoonish.  
Shit aspect: one minute into your shit, a guy in a wheelchair rolls into the bathroom. Every time. 
"This is the last one"  "Id like a sandwich"  "Here's a fucking bullet to the head"  "Thanks" 
Definitely shitty when you're on a long drive by yourself 
That would harm me so badly. I'm obsessed with the old arcade game Snake.  
Call Vector Control in your county and say there are a metric crap-ton of mosquitoes hatching because of all the water.  Be sure to mention Zika virus concerns.  They'll shut that down quickly. 
It's okay we'll just steal this question, reword it slightly, and ask it tomorrow while we have nothing better to do at work.  
The shitty part is that the genie is the one doing the other assignments. He dropped out of high school and doesn't particularly care, so the grade you get on them hovers just barely above failing. 
The shitty part: one of your more senior relatives cleans it up every time, complaining about it constantly 
Wish granted, but it doesn't fly.  Instead, it drunkenly staggers about breaking things and trying to fuck your wife. Also, it's inexplicably racist. 
A small portion of your wish shall be granted. I just upvoted all your reddit activity of the last 20 days. Have I done well? 
You didn't specify what stuff or where it comes out, so now every time someone sneezes, you shit your pants. 
Nah, the real wish here is to have chik fil a open on Sundays 
But that wouldn't be shitty, it would have to always be ar 5% so it's always warning you it's running low and is in battery saving mode, but never dies 
The kinda shitty part is that you don't have to go, but you still get reprimanded for not showing up.  
My ex was scheduled to appear on Jerry Springer once. His girlfriend at the time was a topless dancer, and their show recruiters went to the club she was dancing at to pick up girls for upcoming episodes.   She agreed to film, and managed to get a deal where my ex would get to appear on the show with her. Behind the scenes negotiations involved coming up with a storyline and light scripting (the plot would be that he was appearing on the show to propose to his stripper girlfriend, and she would reveal that she was actually prostituting herself and would introduce him to her pimp). The show runners loved it and even agreed to provide an engagement ring for the bit.   So he woke up for his morning flight, turned on the TV while he packed, and watched the twin towers fall on live TV. 9/11 blocked his chance at white trash fame.  
My favorite is the episode (no idea which of the ghost shows it was) where they hear this wheeze. Most of the show was them freaking out about them. Come to find out it's a really fat cat just chilling on a bed upstairs with a breathing problem. It was pretty funny. 
It's a running joke amongst friends that if you see a white guy driving a yellow taxi in Manhattan, be ready for Cash Cab.  
I mean, if they're making you do things that you wouldn't do normally, that's literally fiction... 
Someone did AMA about American version of this. He said he had to end up selling the car to cover maintenance expenses. On mobile so can't find the exact URL. 
They piece together the narrative for these based on fan reactions. Social media is probably more responsible for keeping reality TV going than almost anything else.  They don't like the fact that that BITCH Alison is somehow still getting all the attention from Tyler? Let's work with that, and make it so that she's actively manipulating him and really doesn't care. 
"...we already agreed what it would look like after its done."  "I know but at least act more surprised!" 
I have no clue how people love his show so much... my gf is obsessed. And I'm like wtf it's so fake it's ridiclious.  
I was born in Henry County, VA and lived there until I was 8, and my sister is 40 and has lived there her whole life. Shining like that actually happens, but not nearly to the scale that it was shown. My sister's ex did have a cold water creek still and made illegal shine (albeit in Patrick County). Now I live in east TN, and everything here is legal.  
From my experience watching the show and other HGTV shows, they almost always make the wife look like a whiny bitch.  
Can confirm, Survivor is some real shit.   I had a lecturer who used to be part of the medic team. People got hurt pretty often, although it was usually the crew, since there's a lot more of them. But exhaustion was a big part of the cast's issues.  He also watched a fellow cast member drown, while on an expedition/day off on one of the islands. Those islands can be genuinely dangerous places. 
This shows how fake these show are.  It's a show about pigs and they're using bullshit. 
Did he just tell the *guy* that he wanted to be on the show so they just gave him a random item the shop already owned? haha Or did he borrow an item from *another* guy he knew? 
I always wondered if they got to keep the furniture and whatnot. Do any of them offer to pay extra to keep it or try to set a budget for them to spend on it off camera?  
My friend was one of the rubbish acts. He knew he was awful, the producers knew he was awful. He was only putting on a character for a laugh. He got called back for the novelty "shit act ensemble" at the end of the season.  Also, this is why so many people come out with shit like "I quit work to be here!" and are devastated when they don't go through, the fact that they've got through the untelevised rounds already has gotten their hopes up. 
I'm glad Bargain Hunt is largely real.  I think I'd have lost my faith in TV altogether if something as wholesome as Bargain Hunt turned out to be all staged!! 
Even as a viewer, I've reacted to that. They do a lot of stuff that looks good, but they don't do anything to the bits that keeps it running and safe. 
"Wait, wait, can we try that entrance again? I don't think I seemed surprised enough." 
A month ago Reddit told that the show was filmed in a recreated studio, due to laws pertaining to the filming inside pawn shops. Anyone know the truth? 
My fraternity helped in a build of a house for that show here in our town. Can confirm, Ty is a dick.   He just acts like he's god's gift to the world, and that he's too good to talk to you. Also, he doesn't do jack shit towards the build, they go off kind of like a Habitat for Humanity build. It was still a cool experience.  
My dad's good friend was on hell's kitchen too. because she had to wake up at 2 am and get yelled at for being slow, she actually cut one of her fingers off. they sent her off to the hospital and put the whole thing on air as a dramatic exit.  
I feel like this would have been a way better episode 
Those guys are so over the top it's hilarious. *digging in the dirt and finds a small metal object* "Holy cow! I don't believe it! This is unreal! *runs up and down the field doing cartwheels, runs in circles whooping and hollering* Other guy goes, "what'd you find?" *panting,  exaggerated heavy breathing* "I just found, are you ready, a metal bar!" *other guy starts whooping and hollering and turning cartwheels and running in circles* "Are you kidding me!? This could've come from Gen. Washington's wagon! This is unreal! Wow." Later on you discover it was a piece of metal off some unknown farmer's hoe. :/  
They clear out the store for filming and select people from the line outside to be extras during filmed sequences.   Almost all of the items brought in are prearranged.  
What they mean is that he's not outrageously attractive but also not deformed enough to have a good sob story. Perfectly average just won't cut it. 
There's videos on YouTube showing them getting recognized during filming. I'm sure it's harder for them to film segments now.  
I wonder as well.  Some of those kids are ripping the carpet up and poking holes in the drywall.  Some lady comes by with a chalkboard and makes them do chores.  All the sudden they are angel and can't stand to see them go.  And the parents are incompetent boobs who become parents of the year by the nanny reminding them that their kid needs a hug sometimes.   
I had two friends on the show. There was a lot of disappointing issues with the way the show was made.  They were very restricted in what they could do. Like not being allowed to go over that hill where all the edible plants are, or failures making it into the show, but not showing when they actually succeeded in getting a fish.  Basically, the survival was real, but they were set up to suffer. And of course the editing filled in when needed for the "story".   Also knew a guy on Dual Survival. It seemed pretty genuine, but there were definitely moments where you could tell something was up.   
"Let's count shoulders"   Or   "If you were a pirate would you have a parrot on this shoulder, or *this* shoulder" 
my boyfriend does this to me all the time  would recommend 11/10 
He just went from like 100 karma to well over 16,000 
I think most of us read "movies" then came to the comments, realized it wasn't, but didn't care enough to switch mental gears. 
Oof. While hilarious, his account is toast for a few weeks. If he wants to keep using it, his best movie is to stop redditing for a couple months. 
Had to read this 3 times cause I still thought you said movie at the end.  
Haha OP is trying to get serious advice but has to spend his time clarifying 
AVP isn't too bad either. Girl and I went to see the movie. All we ended up watching were the opening and closing credits 
I read the OP perfectly but the damage has been done 
I'll never be able to watch the original True Grit without thinking "I had sex to this movie." I clicked on this thread thinking it said movies, too. 
Use the popcorn box on your lap while watching a movie. As the popcorn goes down she will find the surprise at the bottom. Also then the resulting blowjob will be flavoured for her pleasure! 
The hands one is spot on. Too many people just leave their hand resting in one place. Whilst that isn't *bad* you really do notice how it is far from good until someone actually does it; then you realise what you've been missing.  
Yo, I thought I was the only one that used LZ4 side one for impromptu tonsil hockey! 
It works really well if you just scream it at the top of your lungs and stare at the ceiling when you do it.  Super confidence. 
Kiss the ears then go directly to slobbing her bobber. Got it.  
Second party watched you fall down a balcony, shrugged it off, and let you stay until you decided to leave? 
If there are people in a pool, then it's pool party. 
YOUR CLAPS ARE OF THE HIGHEST CALIBER, FELLOW HUMAN. PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN A COOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF THE ACTIVITY? I AM CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A COMPLETELY NON-SYNTHETIC HAND 
I'm imagining him running out without pants on with arms flailing behind him as he happily runs all the way back home. 
problem is he married her. That might've been his breaking point, meaning shit like that has happened before. Good luck to your friend. 
A few years ago, a friend of a friend called everyone in his contact list and left long, rambling messages. It was how I discovered my friend gave him my number. Fun times.   Anyway, he called his best friend - who was my friend's SO - and left 2 full messages crying about how he wanted to live in Middle Earth. Literally sobbing. He had a drunken breakdown because he wanted to be a hobbit. 
do you live in new orleans bc i'm pretty sure i said that a few times  
Last weekend I went to the clubs carrying a loaf of bread. I kept it in my jacket when walking between places and none except the last bouncer actually noticed. Bouncer is busy telling some really drunk guy he couldn't come in, I walk up to show my ID and he asks me what I have in my jacket, so I take out the loaf of bread, bouncer giggles and lets me in. From behind I hear the drunk dude mumbling "I can't come in but he gets to bring his stupid lunch?".  It was a good evening. 
My friend has a recording of me sulking over a girl years ago and I said, "I'm gonna kill myself in half" 
Yeah just shut up and sit there. Once we were all drunk coming back from picking up some blow and my buddy's gf was driving. She rolled through a stop sign and the cop lit us up. My friend almost threw the bag out of the window. I had to yell at him not to and just sit there and not say anything. The car was packed and I told everyone to just shut up and let the girl talk to the cop. She rolled through a stop sign, that's why he pulled her over, that's all we have to worry about. He wrote her a ticket which my buddy paid. Just be cool. And don't do blow, that was during a rough time in my life 
My buddy was riding home when so lowlifes jumped out and threatened violence if he didn't hand over his bike. He ghosted it into a canal (live near the Grand Union, England) and cheesed it. Went back later to fish it out! 
That's awesome. I have a couple of Scottish friends. The accent gets stronger the more they drink. I love it.  
Very good possibility they went home and fucked like rabbits. That's a textbook cuckold fetish. 
I used to do this all the time. A bar I frequented was opposite a late night pizza joint me and my flat mate would order from all the time. We'd call and order a pizza and when the delivery guy came out we'd run over the road and jump in.  
Happened at my brother-in-laws house as well, champagne EVERYWHERE 
You let drunk people play with your new VR headset? You brave soul. 
As a fireman all I did was road accidents. Busy night.  
"Hey have some noodle salad. Good isn't it? So anyway do you wanna buy a scarf?" 
Yeah, that's like, pro-level stupid.  That's how you remove your face and vision. 
One night I pretended my name was Tony and it worked for me.   My Korean friend Park didn't have much luck that night. 
One time I ate pizza that was left on people's plates after they'd left the pizza shop. Apparently I called it "garbage crusts" and I ask for it whenever I'm drunk. So I guess "floor pizza" isn't far off for me   
I have a friend who does this every time she gets drunk. She tries to hint that she wants to have an orgy with the subtlety of a freight train.  
I have done the whole busting blood vessels in the face thing. I was puking and looked up in the mirror and it looked like i grew freckles. 
Omg I had this kinda happen to me two years ago but it was pizza by the slice and a guy dropped his slice onto my back (I had a backless dress on so it literally stuck to my back). He apologized profusely and offered to buy me a slice or something, I declined, he just ran out, the cashier said he didn't even pay for his slice that he dropped on me. I paid for it in exchange for the cashier wiping my back for me hahaha  
Someone else in this thread tried to kiss a 40 year old and was 17.  
Hahaha this reminds me of my brother on our birthday (same day, three years apart) many years ago. I realized I'd lost track of him and asked his friend where he was. Friend pointed and said "over there, petting that guy's beard."  Beard guy looked super uncomfortable. I felt bad, but quickly got him to stop. 
what the fuck is a cooler if it wouldn't kill someone if it landed on them 
this one is my favourite. innocent and hilarious.  
My wife does this 2 to 3 times a year, and the way she responds "you do?" is so honest and adorable it makes me remember why I fell in love with her in the first place.  On occasion she'll also beg me not to leave the room  because, "you're my friend!" in the exact same tone. 
This is why I don't drink heavily, until it becomes the reason I drink heavily. 
Well he was obviously attractive enough to get with two girls in one night! 
The Germans were meticulous record keepers, and a lot fell into Allied hands, at the end of WW2. 
I remember watching a show on History back in the 90's talking about different assassination techniques used by the US and USSR.  The USSR basically had to go to some extreme lengths to pull off an assassination with plausible deniability.  The US just needed someone with a steady hand a high powered rifle.  I can't remember the exact reason why, but I think it boiled down to in the Soviet Union if someone died suddenly it was just best not to ask questions so their forensic expertise wasn't up to par with their American counterparts. 
My roommate told me about this a month ago and the very thought of it is creepy as fuck. Just an entire town, all the ruckus and noise and then....nothing. There are pictures too, those are just horrible.  
Anything that serious won't be actually true "declassified". Shit like MKULTRA had to be leaked. 
Kudos to the tech who said "Three is good, but four is better" 
Do you have any link or the full speech? I would love to read that.  I searched around and only found bits of it in articles.  
If you think they'll declassify any relevant info, I think you'll be in for a shock.  
Why do you think governments are trying to regulate the internet? 
They did this in the States as well. Very very disturbing history. 
This was actually the same guy who named walkie talkie.  
I've recently realized the same thing for the word "movies"  "Look at all these moving pictures and stories... what shall we call this?"    "eh movies" 
 I call eggs pre-birds, or future birds. Root beer is super water. Tortillas are bean blankies. And I call forks ... Food rakes. 
One of the best nicknames I've ever heard for HIV was the "high five." 
What do you call a Frenchman wearing sandles?    Philippe Philoppe.  
From now on I must refer to GTA-V as "stealie wheelie vee" 
Just wanted to say I'm glad people like you still exist   So hard to find a good poop engraver  
I just got expensive custom musician earplugs from an audiologist because I go to a lot of concerts and festivals, and boy do I wish I had done it earlier. I always assumed audiologists only work with old people but I could tell he does all sorts of interesting stuff.  Now I feel old as I want to tell everyone to protect their ears better. 
How long did it take you to find your job?   What degree do you have currently and how long did it take you to get there?   Have you always worked for the elementary school or were you also in research? Which of those would you say is more fascinating/rewarding?   What would you recommend to someone aspiring to be a speech pathologist? (I'm just starting at junior college but am deciding between speech pathology/sociology/music)    
As the assistant manager of an ice cream shop I know that sticky feeling all to well.   Another bonus, people love me after work because I smell like waffle cones.  
Is going the full route to become a CPA worth it? Especially with how difficult I've heard the exams are. I'm currently an accounting student, and I was basically wondering if working for businesses and such are worth not getting the CPA?  Another question would be is the job as boring as everyone that isn't an accountant makes it out to be? 
So, I'm studying Chemical Engineering (BS) right now, and I really like the concept of heat transfer and thermodynamics. What kind of background do you have that qualified you for this position? Additionally, did you have a really strong interest in materials engineering, or did the opportunity just kind of happen, and you ended up loving it? Thanks for any answers! 
I'm interested in becoming a nurse!  What does a normal day look like for you? And what kind of schooling am I looking at? 
Your ideas intrigue me.  I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. 
Why don't you look at journalism as well? If you're unable to get a job in your country, look at working overseas in international relations. Pick a party and volunteer. Look at candidates and help out. Be involved in your community and volunteer groups and charities if you can. Try and be in a leadership role of some sort. 
How does someone get into Umpiring or refereeing in general. My dad was an Athletic Director at my high school, but he never told me. 
I am so happy to see someone actually say they love teaching. Everyone always bitches about teaching and when I tell them what I am going to school for they tell me not to. I'm going to teach social studies and English, so a bit different from you but it is still so refreshing to hear someone say they enjoy their job.  I guess my question is, is the common core no child left behind problem that bad? Are teachers really that backed into a corner and allowed no freedom to teach how they want?   
I disagree with that last bit. Otherwise it wouldn't be very mobile.   *edit ITT: my numerous illegitimate children 
So were you like a computer science or engineer major before youtube? You seem to know a lot about coding and circuits. 
How hard is it to get in the field? I'm considering doing a Masters in neuropsychology, then research. What's the research like?  
Job fair can't be complete without the armed forces :)  where's the telemarketer guy? 
Yeah. OP was probably thinking more along the lines of "Career Day."  
Didn't Google start ignoring literal string / exact match quotes a few years ago? 
Another useful trick for forms:   inurl:showthread 
What's the difference between using "John Smith" and John/Smith? 
Google advanced search works if you're trying to sift through a tonne of things that are close to your search but not exactly. My problem is that my searches turn up nothing anyway so advanced search narrows 10 useless responses to 0 responses 
True, but this can also bring up biased information. Check the inverse search too, if possible 
That's how I found Reddit in the first place. After multiple google searches to my questions I would keep ending up here. So then I started always added Reddit to the end. Couple years later made an account.  Now I'm on here every day. 
Or use proper questions. Google can interpret natural language. 
So what you're saying is that OP should have googled for this instead of asking us? 
It's military v. Military v. Police v. Public support for coup v. Public support for erdogan. Then you've also got the Kurds...many against the coup, some I presume will see this an opportunity for advancing their own political aims, etc etc. What a complete mess. 
They're the ones throwing the coup, not overthrowing it but yes it's a bit of a tradition over there.  
Yeah the live thread is very confusing  "Coup has failed"    "Military in control"    "Erdogan in Istanbul with thousands of supporters "     "That is old shit he are streaming"  My head hurts. 
I hope you stay safe, just wait it out and it should blow over, Erdogan's on the ground so hopefully the immediate violence will stop.   It's a bit of a dirty trick to use the call to prayer to push his message, and a bit rich when he was circling safe in his jet.  
These past few years have proven why "may you live in interesting times," is a curse and not a blessing.  
What's particularly telling is that the rebels compelled people to stay in their homes for their safety.  Erdongen, on holiday, compelled people to go out to the streets and confront the soldiers, knowing many would die.  It sort of doesn't make sense though that you'd take over a bridge and a handful of places to rebel. Why not just storm the parliament when Erdongen was there? You'd have to think that the military commanders were just fantastically bad at strategic thinking...  It's clear that the coup was conducted too late. If the idea was to intervene to prevent a theocracy from consuming Turkey, it should have happened earlier. 
Both the AP and CNN idiotically claimed what was propaganda without verification 
Urging them to take to the streets and fight *people who have fucking tanks and attack helicopters*. Nothing says "I love my people" like asking them to go aggravate guys piloting 50-ton murdermachines while you desperately flee the country on a private jet. 
Yeah, it didn't really last long and now he can put forward more extreme laws and reduce the power of the military who's only job since the foundation of the country was to make sure it stayed secular 
"We are hearing that a coup is occurring in the democratically elected Turkey, the military wants to out democratically elected leader Erdogan, who was democratically elected" -CNN    
Calls people to the streets, flees instead of helping. Lmfao 
Yup. A failed coup is a hundred times worse than no coup at all.   Erdogan will now have reason for vengeance, and some very twisted legitimacy for further action.  
no one knows. the only "repelled" reports are coming from Turkish state and government agencies.  the ones whom would benefit from actually repelling it. 
Does it make you feel comfortable that he is talking about Pennsylvania and implying CIA involvement while we have nukes in his country?  
Counter-psy ops. Gotta make it look like the government is still in power so the people in the streets stay there. If they think the coup has succeeded, they may just go home. 
I read something (trying to find it in this thread) that he said the cycling F-16's where there to threaten him and that they bombed his previous location or something like that? If they bombed his previous location why didn't they bombed him at the airport? I mean they are fighter jets they could have taken him out of the air before he even had a chance of landing. Numerous fighter jets and helicopter everywhere and they just let him land? He can give a speech in front of a crowd with cameras? There is either something fishy about this or this is the boldest and most incompetent military coup in history. 
Good thinking! Those fighter jets would have made light work of him.  
Yeah, Ankara is pretty much locked down by the Pro-Coup forces.  Still haven't seen anything other than Police vs. Military either - I think the lack of Military vs. Military might show that a far larger group might support the coup than originally broadcasted. 
more incoming: * 16 soldiers were sent to take erdogans palace where there are at least 250 armed elite force defendants. * 20 swat equivalent police officers waited side by side with 13 soldiers at taksim square. * captured soldiers claim they are conscripts ordered to make a drill. they surrendered when they realised what was going on.  more will come. 
CNN aired footage of some sort of confrontation on the bridge. There were tanks on the bridge, and civilians crowding under an overpass with flags and the likes, chanting something. You could hear gunfire, but nobody knew if it was being fired at the state police, or if it was riot control weapons being used to disperse the crowds. 
I am and I'm terrified for Turkey. Erdogan would be unstoppable if the coup fails.  
Can't help but be thankful. But I feel sad for the innocent people that are caught in the crossfire. 
Not everyone lost, there was one winner and his name was Sultan Erdogan 
Most Turkish coups have been relatively peaceful. Ataturk had a big influence on the military and on the secular bits of Turkey that are still left. 
The censorship over there makes it difficult to hold a discussion. 
Turkey already had a couple of millitary coups before while part of NATO. America likes the Turkish military a lot more than edrogen and wont stop this  
If they attached a generator to attaturk they could generate enough power for half of turkey just from him spinning in his grave. 
Ya everyone in school lives on 7 layers of irony and I love it  
I am guilty of secretly enjoying watching parents of students who graduated with my daughter last year having complete melt downs now watching the children they diligently helicoptered become the drunk-party-animal-failing-all their-classes students.  Karma may bite me over it, but I hated watching them give their kids *zero* leeway to enjoy any part of their lives. 
But how dare your father not give their *little angel* an a+ on everything.  What's frustrating is that the same parents that read your post will likely agree with you.  But then a teacher gives *their* kid a bad grade?  Well, now that changes everything. 
Once you hit college: you better have brought your calculator mother fucker, no we don't have one for you to borrow. 
Now it's just "you do that assignment?" "I got it from Johnny you need it?" "Yeah send it" then we just text pictures over 
I mean I'm HS class of 2016 but can confirm. I don't know if I'm alive for 50% of the days I get out of bed. Just keeping a physical body alive long enough to go to class and study and do homework and and go to clubs you don't care about and then go back and sleep and repeat.  There's no passion in life to a lot of '17 kids. People are doing the grind ever so passively because spending time doing something else is a risk in it itself - unless you're using that time to distract yourself, in which case most students will do it to excess.   Man, and I'm part of the problem, sitting in bed texting on Reddit when I should have gone to class but instead slept through it because I was watching a Twitch stream. But I'm just gonna keep doing it, cause I'm just so fucking tired.  
I came out in grade 12 in 2010 my senior year. It was surreal, everyone was just cool with it and no one really cared. I even stopped being teased for 'being gay', because once it became real I think people were afraid to diss it. Anyway, I'm so happy that atleast in my area (Ontario) it's quite safe for lgbtq students.   My highschool had a positive space group, we had about 10 or so openly gay or questioning and everyone was cool with that too. We'd meet every Friday and have pizza for lunch, even once or twice a semester the teachers who ran the group would take us all to an art gallery and into the 'village'. So surreal.  I'm so glad I haven't had to deal with much negativity, but it saddens me that I had one of the best out comes and others don't have a chance, anyway I'm rambling but your comment kind of put my brain on a tangent. 
Can confirm '17 I work for a cell phone carrier and one of the most highly congested part of our network is surrounding high schools. So not surprised 
My little brother just recently graduated high school. During his junior year, another student streaked at a football game.  He was arrested and they tried to get him booked as a sex offender. He ended up killing himself. It was devastating, many many people were horrifie at the school's reaction. I remember my parents specifically saying that streaking at a big game would've been frowned upon but ultimately not a big deal when they were in school. 
I had a history teacher reference in high school how he used to ask students "What was the first political scandal you remember?" It was always Monica Lewinsky until my year group. 
Former Coast Guard Boarding Officer here. I would have never done that shit, but who's to say you weren't dealing with the Yost Guard.  
Yes, I've always heard about stereotypes (high school) like jocks not caring about grades and partying all the time. Some of my best friends are sports players and they work incredibly hard. 
I was under the impression dabbing died with 2016. Was hoping anyway. 
not a bad thing at all that they know to question nonsensical answers like that 
Can I ask if you're in middle/high school or college? When I was in high school, every single person thought they were the exception and that everyone else in their class was a hairless barbarian. 
I don't know why but this was the only one that made me laugh out loud.  
How would that work if they were home alone? Would someone just break into their house exclusively to ask them questions? 
Yeah, I can't imagine Mr. Salt n' Glass Penis-Tube up there sleeps well at night. 
You have to let them get some sleep, otherwise they'll die from sleep deprivation.  Let's make it random whether the scream goes off or not. Maybe 1 out of 10 times. Enough so that on the outside they appear to be functioning normally but they're being slowly driven insane by Satan jacking their Bluetooth speaker. 
But wouldn't getting half a boner be an awkward situation, thus giving you a full boner?  
I remember back in the day when you could (if a friend's Facebook was left unattended) set someone's _default_ group for status updates to 'only myself'. This resulted in the user being relegated to their own, solo, echo chamber of sadness... Quite cruel, really.  
But any advertisement will load in perfect HD and have no buffering. 
I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little... but on pretzel day... well, I like pretzel day... 
I'd prefer giving them that feeling of having to cough but no matter how much they cough nothing ever comes up. They keep coughing because they figure "This time, something will break loose and I'll have some relief" but no. No relief. They keep coughing because there's something in their lungs but it never comes out. 
I have one of those stereotypical Asian parents. One of my friends would just randomly blurt out "Hey, when was that paper you needed to write due?" or "Are you ready for the math test?" and for the next week, my mom would be all "Pbghin! No playing video games, you have test coming up!" I'd correct her, but the idea of "there might be a test/paper/project due" outweighs the idea of "James is a shit-stirring asshole." 
I have no feeling in parts of my right arm. No feeling, that is, except for when it's itchy. I can feel the itch, but *I can't feel it when I scratch*! It's like nothing is happening. And the itch just stays there for hours, maybe even a day or two. It's literally an itch I can't scratch and it drives me nuts! 
And replace all of their salt with calcium bromide. 
Christ almighty, it's difficult to imagine what that would be feel like. Nice curse 
Time to castrate myself, because if people knew the sexual thoughts I was having then they'd run away. 
Ow god Jerry you can't even get your own name right. 
Hold off on this, I'm experimenting with behavioral altering by purposefully stumbling into them. Especially if they have their fucking laptop open walking around. 
or, instead of deleting browser history it would make browser history viewable to everyone.  
Just picturing this being implemented is hilarious. In places like the person's home or work, a device of some sort could be placed above the door to dispense glitter. For other places though I can only imagine someone hanging above the door waiting for this person to walk under or someone would have to follow the person with a bottle of glitter and sprinkle it on them every time. I think in order to not be predictable, each doorway would have to have a different person who pours the glitter.  
as someone with hyperhidrosis and social anxiety this is just another day for me  
Joke's on you; they will utilize this for free clean energy generation, making millions!! 
I like this. Very creative. You have a talent. You're probably on a CIA recruitment list somewhere. 
Alright, I thought we were doing funny comments here, not ones which hurt. 
This is actually a thing - although to a lesser degree than you intended, I imagine.  It's called distichiasis. For me, the most annoying bit is that I get these regular length eyelashes in the inner corners of my eye. They'll poke/tickle my eyeball and cause random tears ( crying not damage ) until I pluck them.  I get them less often and shorter in the outer corners, and least of all on the mucous membrane of the middle of the lids ( bottom more than top ). 
Had this happen to me IRL. I took sleeping pills until the problem went away. When I'd wake up, I'd often spend the entire time crying because it was so uncomfortable.  Can confirm, this is the definition of hell. I have fonder memories of being stabbed. 
Thanks to a one-two punch of OCD and synesthesia, I can't round the tv volume to multiples of five, so come at me. 
This is fucking horrible, maybe the worse not violent one for me. I have a pretty serious drug problem and usually the only time ill stop and go home is after a few days because I smell, I don't know why but for me being smelly is maybe the. Most embarrassing thing, strangely more than being a drug addict.    
that's clever as fuck, and would be insanely inconvenient. 
My wife and i agreed that if either of us was terminal, instead of stringing it out by "making us comfortable", we bail on the hospital, say goodbye to our loved ones, and go on a bender, that for the terminal one, wont end. 
So... ulcerative colitis? I already have that. What else you got? 
But if they read a left-sign (and understand right) they will try to go right but then go left because they always turn wrong, which makes them right again....? 
Finally a good answer that is not a magical curse. 
Honestly this one wouldn't affect me much.  Sometimes hearing a spoiler just makes me want to watch the movie even more to see the events leading up to it or afterwards.   The exception would be movies with an important twist, spoilers suck for those.  
Pretty sure necropheliacs wouldnt have an undying fetish... 
Ok, that's a unique one. But it's pretty evil too. The octopi would almost certainly die pretty much immediately so you're gonna have some nasty rotting octopus everywhere for a few weeks, at least until it rains. 
Ha, you fool! I already suffer from this! Your plans have been foiled. I also look like a panda from the dark circles under my eyes all the time - even when I sleep properly.  :( 
Ha, lucky for me I'm shit at electronics already. In fact the more blue smoke I inhlae, the worrse I become as eloctrics. bortle baby bortle 
I have 02 I feel you.   I was at a red light with my friend and a challenger shows up next to me. As a joke I start revving my engine pretending I was gonna race him. He didn't even hear my engine lol.  
No kidding. My mother was on that shit for years. One night she did deep knee bends for two hours in the dark living room. Another night she asked me "where the black man was that liked your hair", when she hadn't had a black guest in years. Yet another night she tried to make a cake - in the morning there was pancake mix, an uncracked egg and maple syrup in a bowl on the counter. Ambien will fuck you up. 
Funny. I'm pretending my 1.8t gti is a dodge viper.  
People ask me what my cam is. I tell them it's a 7/11 cam. They are like what? I say that my valves are always open. 
You can save a lot of money by just removing the exhaust system altogether.  Just sit still with the windows closed and rev away for as long as you can. I meant want. As long as you want. 
Bubble backs with 14" fart cans and shocker stickers  
Yeah, me too. Except I don't know of this thing you call "park." I have speeds 1 through 5 and a gear marked "R", which I assume is for race. 
I used to have to do this.  single carb, air cooled engines hate cold weather but it was my only way around.  I loved riding a motorcycle and loved working on it but living in a walkable neighborhood is such a relief  
Holy shit, there's a 24-7 fitness place that actually has people who work out at 2am... that's kind of awesome.  I've always wondered what it must be like to use a card lock place to go lift at 3am, some weird 24-7 Popeye-bro in there who has been waiting for years for someone to spot his benchpress. 
"Revving your engine" to kittens is pretty messed up 
Ugh I had a neighbor with two ancient trucks that he parked in front of my house.  These trucks shared *one* battery, every time he wanted to switch trucks he'd have to switch the battery.  Hoods banging, engine revving to get things flowing, don't miss that at all. 
Yes!   My neighbor just has a very shitty off roader truck thing, he likes to get started early.  To make up for it, he brings back fish or hunted meat, and hosts neighborhood bbq's.    Everyone in the neighborhood has something irritating, but we all make up for it.  Lady with the noisy dogs down the street opens up her pool on weekends.  The couple with the 3 screaming kids lets us use their amazing woodworking shop.  I have the eyesore house but let anyone load up on produce from my fruit trees/vegetable gardens, as much as they want.  Etc etc.  Whole neighborhood is like this.  The irritating stuff fades away if people give back somehow. 
Just stay the fuck away when they're pulling out of the parking lot. 
Perhaps even grandma was abused herself and that could be what drove her to do it. 
Damn. That guy was fully responsible for his own death, you just happened to be there. Lucky he didn't take you with him.  It's a shame, but double the speed limit in the middle of the night with no lights? 100% his fault. 
To hold a stranger's hand in his final moments. You are a beautiful person. I hope you are okay now.  
That seems like it should have definitely been at least a two person job. 
And don't make illegal u-turns like a dumbass. That would've solved the issue.  
Thats not your fault. You didn't let somebody too drunk drive. Thats what you're *supposed* to do. 
He got to spend his last few days with his grandkids, and helping his child through a rough patch. If you could ask him, I bet he wouldn't regret his decisions at all. 
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown? 
You can't live your life at the beck and call of everyone else. It's healthy to take time for yourself. I'm sorry that this happened in this case and I understand why you feel guilty, but you couldn't have known. 
As part of my job, I work with seniors to improve their reflexes and balance.  These are things that degrade with age.  In most demographics, falls kill more older adults than anything other than heart disease and cancer.  People with good balance and quick reflexes rarely seriously injure themselves from a fall.  Your grandfather in his younger years could have recovered from his misstep, or could have gotten his arms out in front of him in time.  Frailty, decline, and bad luck killed your grandfather, not you.  It could have been a crack in a sidewalk. 
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide.   It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault.  
I wonder how many lives you unknowingly saved by repoing someone's car. 
It may take or have taken you a long time to believe this, or maybe you never will, but you did him a really big favour.  
I had a similar but less serious incident as an adult in Taiwan. A friend dropped me off at the place I was staying. I opened the door on the kerb side and a kid on a bicycle slammed into it. He was ok, a few scratches. What some may not realize is that sidewalks are uncommon in Asia and so the area between buildings and cars is still road. The reaction of my friends suggested this was my fault and I should have looked before opening the door. 
You aren't clairvoyant. I know you're in this profession to help and I completely understand the frustration, anger and sadness that comes with hindsight, but please don't beat yourself up when all of your efforts and training don't turn out to be magic. Focus on the people you do save, while still having sympathy for the ones you couldn't. I'm positive the former outweighs the latter.  
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.    I'm sorry for your loss man. 
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you?  
You say that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but hey, you're alive. Sure, it would be great if that man had survived, but if he had been in front of you, you'd be the dead one, and he'd be typing up this comment now. I know that it sucks that you had to be involved in something like this, but fate works in cruel, yet mysterious ways. Maybe the guy would have died the next day from a heart attack or something? I know, still awful to think about, but look on the bright side: at least you weren't texting and driving. If that had been the case, then yeah, it would have been a lot more awful if someone had died because you were distracted, but that's not what happened. The other guy just got really unlucky that day. 
Neither of you knew about his condition.  He was essentially a ticking-time bomb.  The circumstances of it suck, but it's not your fault. 
Hey, it might not have been your kit that was used. Even if it was, you had no way of knowing what would happen. 
'She opened my eyes' sounds a lot like 'she opened her thighs'.  What a douche. 
Junkies with kids? Might explain why the kids stayed somewhere else.   
They were totally different songs. You see, yours were like "ding ding ding ding da da ding ding". But theirs were like "da ding ding ding da da ding ding". Completely different songs. 
this shit always happened to me too, and making friends is not an easy feat for me, like a lot of people. i noticed each year they were always "busy" (i.e., not texting, calling, answering messages) when my birthday rolled up. no matter how far in advance we'd plan shit, i'd always be the one left alone. everyone else got plans made by the others when it was their birthday, they'd plan freaking parties for them. and i always went to their birthday whatever they were doing. that was me though, i was the one there for them and when they didn't want something i was inconvenient. always about anything. if they were having bad shit in their life i was the first one they called. first one they'd call, first one they'd blow off. it sincerely hurt how much i was there for them through a lot of heavy shit, helped them out before they were kicked out and almost homeless. fuck all those people, I'm sorry that happened to you but hell yeah it kinda working out in the end!  
I stayed friends as best I could with an ex of mine. On the surface, things seemed pretty bad as she started dating my roommate. But on the inside, she was conspiring with another friend of mine to keep me single. They told the girl I crushed on that I was just using her to make my ex jealous. Made that girl cry. Eventually made me cry after all was said and done.  It's been a year and a half and I have no regrets. The other "friend" was a shitty person anyways.   Edit 4/1/17: I have not forgotten these events, though I legitimately wish everyone the best despite this. 
If dude had depression issues then this is plausible. It's shitty but plausible. 2 depressed people are much worse than just 1.  
With the details you've given, it sounds like your sister's husband is doing some manipulating. He may have told your sister that you came on to him or something else. I never trust a go-between. 
Man, some people are sadistic. I don't get why they would get joy out of others' suffering, and to be aware that people who do that ARE sick, and yet do it themselves? Sociopathic...  These are people that eventually become the same conniving snakes in the workplace, causing toxic environments and office politics. 
I hear that... 7 years, 2 beautiful daughters, she had an affair and charged me with assault to over shadow what she did, Never laid a hand on her.  Wish I was able to get over her. I have that feeling I will carry her ghost the rest of my adult life. 
My God what a wonderful ending. Completely infuriating, though, that the teacher was able to get away with so much. How long ago was this? 
Raise your hand if you can see a chunk of pencil lead under your skin years after getting stabbed.  
Do they know you know? Or do you have a chance to mess with them back? 
There are two sure ways to lose a friend.  One is to loan money to a friend and the other is to borrow money from a friend. 
That is particularly fucking evil.  Acid tends to make _most_ people really sweet and vulnerable.  These people must have been born evil. 
dumb pieces of shit. your life should not be entertainment for others. 
Not to shit on anyone, but this doesn't really sound like she stole your boyfriend considering he was just using you the entire time. More like those two people are complete shit and deserve to be stung by wasps every 5 minutes. 
This thread makes me feel better about not having friends in the first place... 
That's when you melee him in the back, and start an impromptu deathmatch for 30 minutes in the middle of your legendary campaign. Until truce is called and you continue the campaign for another 30 minutes until the same thing happens again. 
I hope you don't hold it against him/her.  Risk alliances are supposed to end in betrayal. 
This reminds me of back in the day when people hacked\* people's facebook accounts.    \*Hacked=Leaving your account logged in. 
Some people use exaggerated emotions as a tactic in business setting. Executives tends to do this the most. They know they do it, though they'll deny it until the day they die.   If they do it enough, they'll get a reputation that proceeds them. But that actually helps them when it comes to working internally. Most people tend to roll over and just go with the flow of someone is emotionally intense. It's a subtle type of organizational bullying.   The best tactic is just to act like it doesn't bother you. Don't raise your voice and keep a stone face if you can. Keep the discussion factual and talk in a calm voice. Ask them questions. Eventually they will run out of gas, if they realize emotional chaos won't push your buttons.  
Yeah I've coached and reffed kids at soccer... sigh. I never minded them worrying about the kid getting hurt, but getting angry at a refereeing call or that your kid isn't playing enough...   For one, it's very rare for a call to be that controversial at that level. They aren't playing fast enough, it's usually clear what happened. For another, most rec leagues have playing time requirements. Positions are discussed at practice, kids get a chance to play where they want. It's just raging for the sake of it. 
Saw a menu that said something along the lines of  Gluten-free substitutes: $2   If you're drinking a beer: $3 
Reminds me of those parents who took their kids to see Deadpool and lost their shit, demanding their money back and threatening to sue, because there was adult themes in a comic book movie. It's fucking rated R, you idiot. What did you think was gonna happen? That's some lazy, shitty, goddamn parenting.  
Fun fact: Nuclear reactors are designed to not explode. Nuclear bombs are designed to explode. 
Put a sticker on the window. It doesn't have to be huge.  
Nah, I think it's pretty legit to be pissed that you have to wait a long time at the doctor's office. You make *appointments* at those places. If they're not ready for you at your appointment time, they fucked up. 
I had a mentor that used to tell me that in the end you're always stuck with you. So, make sure that's a person you want to be around.  
It happens any time a change in the film industry takes place.   Films with sound? That's just uncultured. Films in color? It's the end of movies. At home streaming? That isn't true cinema.   I swear these people have the memory span of goldfish. Change happens. Embrace it or get left behind.  
It's fun to compare the objective pros and cons of technology, but it's pretty rare that *A* is better than *B* at everything rings true.  There are things I love/hate about iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, OS X, BSD, etc. 
Maybe if they strapped her backwards to the top, all that hot air would do some good. 
And calm down about the refs.  They are usually only a couple of years older than the kids they are refereeing/umpiring.  My son loves baseball.  He qualified as an umpire when he was around 12.  He knew the rules better than the grown ups, but it was also meant to be a learning time.  He did it for one year and quit.  The parents were horrible to him.  I remember a huuuuge father leaning over him and yelling at him about a call.  Fuck that guy. 
Because there is always "limited space in the overhead bins" 
We're going to hit 30 on saturday in Britain. The weather forecast just slapped a huge 30 over the whole island in a "its gonna be s hot the specifics dont even matter" kinda way. 
I stand up even though I know I have a 15 minute wait simply because I need to try to get some feeling back into my long legs before I have to walk off the plane.  
I'm the same way. I'm an Android enthusiast. I personally won't use any other phone. I couldn't care less if you use an iPhone, Samsung, HTC, hell or even a Windows phone. Just don't be a dick about it. I hate when people with iPhones just want to talk shit to me about my phone.   That's the only time that I ever say anything to people about their phone. When they say something to me, I typically like to destroy their beliefs around their phone because they've decided to be that guy.  
He makes me want to chew gum and stay out past curfew! 
I started my first office job recently, at a subsidiary of a fortune 100 company. I work with 5 other people and they're all older than 40 and have been working there for several years. Most of the job *should* be done through computers, but several aspects are still done with a pen and paper because they can't adapt to the technology. I had to show someone how to download files from an email and attach them in another. They had worked there for YEARS. I did all of the daily tasks in under an hour and they were amazed. I just don't understand how huge companies are able to function.  
The people selling the expensive toast and coffee *are* the American dream though... 
The worst is when millennials themselves write these kinds of articles. Way to throw your entire generation under the bus assholes. 
This is just Minions all over again. If you aren't a middle schooler, odds are your primary exposure to these things comes either from Facebook or from complaints on Reddit.  Reddit loves to hate things. In particular, Reddit loves to hate popular things, often solely for the fact that they're popular. Many people here have a real eagerness to grumble about all the "damn kids" and how things were different "back in my day." It's the tendency to hail one's own childhood fads as high-culture while shitting all over the fads of newer generations.  If Pokemon came out for the first time tomorrow and became absurdly popular in elementary and middle schools, the bulk of Reddit would probably lump it in with Minions and fidget spinners. 
It's been getting less violent but in exchange, we're now able to see every violent thing that happens.  
But also, I hate when people shit on me for not liking things. I don't like Star Wars and I don't like the Beatles and I don't give two shits about most comic book-related media, but I just don't talk about it. If the conversation switches to something I don't like, I just politely sit out because everyone should be allowed to like their things. But when they find out I don't care who shot first or how Yoko ruined the band or whatever, people can get really mean. Some of us aren't trying to be shitty just to be shitty, some of us are just not into space samurais.  
Weren't there also female French Resistance characters in Call of Duty 3?  
To be fair, you WON'T talk to most of them ever again. You will go out in the real world and realize that it's a much bigger place than you realized.  
I don't do the flag on the profile because you have that really awkward moment when you have to take it down... 
Right? I am all for being a more health conscious population (i.e. maintaining a healthy, balanced diet) but some of the advice I have seen come out of the "movement" is sometimes just hyperbolic.  
He probably meant for you to *stop cooking altogether* 
Can recommend Jacques Pepin as well when it comes to learning basic techniques. 
Damn. 49 yrs. The rolling motion. I forgot about the rolling motion.   Welp. I probably have 20 yrs left before I'm spoon fed so thanks.  
my mom will only cook with max heat because its faster, but it always ended up tasting better than my dad's careful heat management.   then i found out that chinese food is to be made on high heat always basically :/ 
I learned this while coming up with a perfect spaghetti sauce - originally I wanted to add every ingredient under the sun because I thought it'd give it more of a complex flavor, then I didn't have 2 or 3 of the 10 ingredients I typically used one day but went ahead and made it anyways and the sauce tasted almost a bit more savory.   This is great advice for beginning chefs who are experimenting with their recipes!  
To piggy back on this, DO NOT use sweetened cocoa powder or semi-sweet, as the sugar will caramelize.  
Man...every time I want to brown something, and my dad is around, he'll put a lid on the pan because all the 'flavor is being let out', apparently. Sometimes I have to be stern and say I'm following a recipe, but how can I explain this to him? All the meat my parents cook seems to be half-boiled in its own juices from putting lids on every fucking pan... 
* Does not apply if it's tomato based, add sugar instead.  
Very important for baking. Cookies shouldn't look done when you take them out. 
I went for the catch one time because my cat was like rubbing itself on my ankles at the time. No regrets because cleaning up the bloody mess from me catching a knife by the blade was easier than cleaning up the mess of a dead cat would've been. Plus I kinda liked my cat and didn't want to accidentally stab it. 
Or if something comes out a bit sloppier that you expected, you have created a nice wholesome "Rustic" dish. 
I thought that meant that everything is supposed to be keep in its rightful place.  So you can find it when you need it. 
Cut everything before you even touch a cooker. Mise en Place.  
This but also with tops of certain veggies. I've used carrot greens, radish greens, and celery leaves sauteed with butter and salt. They also taste good thrown into salads.  Just do a quick google check to see if it's edible beforehand. 
People should eat "filling" veggies instead of going for salads if they want to feel full but lower the calories. Broccoli is a great filling veggie, as are squashes and bok choy. There is also great produce to be found at asian markets for greater variety, like enoki mushroom, elephant stalk, and water cress. 
I usually multiple the garlic in recipes by anywhere from 5-10x.  I've never gotten to the point where I've thought "shit, maybe I put too much in". 
Jesus, i can feel your arms flailing as you speak.  
When you get good enough, you can just look briefly at the recipe and already see why the person that wrote it doesnt have tastebuds. 
Following up: Don't experiment if you don't have an alternative meal planned.  Especially if you're already hungry. That's a recipe for disaster. 
As a rule of thumb, the more you paid for something, the less you should season it. Some yuppie farm-to-table chicken? Salt, pepper, olive oil, maybe a tiny bit of some green herb, oregano, thyme, or my personal favorite majoran.   2 bucks a pound frozen chicken breasts? Hell fucking yes paprika is amazing.  
If there's anything I've learned from the Food Network, it's that I shouldn't be afraid of salt. 
Ooh, now that is useful. I'm always pedantic about having clean hands so this will probably help 
Have you ever tried to cut a large sweet potato by only letting the blade do the work?  
Oh, that's just maddening. :( I had something like that happen fresh out of high school. I applied for a receptionist job and was interviewed, but they never called me back. Finally I went in again to inquire about the position, and they said they wanted me to work full-time as a prep cook in their restaurant (which everyone in town knew was a shift place). And they wanted my answer immediately. I said no thanks, went home, and cried. 
I have a little anecdote about the illegal questions.   I was an Assistant Manager at a well known casual dining chain, and my GM told me that he had a suspicion that one of the girls he had just hired was pregnant.  It was such an odd to thing to say, so I asked why he thought that, and he said that she looked pregnant.  I had no idea what he meant, but because he had a history of saying wildly inappropriate things, I was just glad that he hadn't asked her anything.  So, a few days go by and I finally see her doing her training with a large belly bumping against the production line. She was at least 7 months pregnant lol.  I had a good laugh at his "suspicion".    She quit a couple weeks later.  (Yes, I know some women can look pregnant when they aren't, but this employee was very slender except for the basketball extending from her abdomen. Clearly pregnant.) 
Out of curiosity, how would you suggest to bring this up? I am at a job I love with a great work life balance, but I still think they would have counted against me if I asked about hours that early on. 
This needs to be higher. I mean, a lot of these red flags are good, but this is a pretty much guaranteed sign right here. 
I always feel when I interview someone and make an offer that if the interviewer wants to skip their notice that's a real red flag. Because you wouldn't want someone to do that to you as their boss - it's happened to me in the past and it does burn bridges. Sucks.  
When I was still working minimum wage jobs to get through school, I had an interview where they mentioned this, and it ended up being one of the nicer places I worked. I think the context for mentioning it is very important, as is the type of job. E.g. a high turnover rate at a legal office would be a lot more worrying than a high turnover rate at a McDonalds.  If they say it has a high turnover rate because of high stress, or a "fast paced environment", sure, that's a red flag. But the place I worked just had a hard time finding people who gave a shit. They'd basically never show up on time (if at all) and weren't reliable enough to remain employed. When I finished my program and took a new job, I gave my two weeks notice in person and in writing to the department manager, who was incredibly happy to have been given enough time to find someone new before I left for good. Most people who'd quit in the past just stopped showing up. 
I once drove 3 hours one way only to be told as soon as I got there that they had just hired for the position, and he was such a great guy and he could start on Monday! Is that wonderful? All I said was "Well, good for you." And then when I got back to the parking lot I called my dad crying and he thought I had been in an accident lol. And then a friend told me that it was clearly my fault because I should have called to confirm the interview! Fuck off bitch. Those fuckers should have called ME to cancel, OR just interviewed me anyway and not even tell me that THEY had wasted my fucking time.  Also their office was TINY. Like fucking Nick Valentine's office/home in Fallout 4 is bigger than this place was. 
Our CEO bragged he has never taken a vacation or sick day and doesn't understand why anyone else isn't the same. He refused any PTO until HR explained to him he can't dock salaried pay unless he offers PTO. He was literally taking money out of your check if you took a day off on salary.   Occasionally an employee would have a family member come in and give them a tour of our production floor. He would express surprise anyone would do this, and when someone said they were proud of our company and the work we did he told them they weren't the ones doing the impressive work.  I have lots of stories about him. We didn't get the nickname 'Asperger's Anonymous' out of thin air. 
Ugh. That's a shite interviewer. If she's more about her vacation than her job, then claims to not remember you, that's a red flag. 
Had a similar experience with a company who got people in the door touting bonuses "up to" a certain percent. What they didn't mention was that that was at one time in the company's history and the numbers were always far lower than what they told their workers during the interview. When it came time for bonuses they would say something like "we didn't hit our aggressive profit projections, sooo... no bonuses!". Meanwhile their workers were putting in 60+ hour weeks and management always seemed to be talking about which of their yachts was their *favorite* 
I'm working a job I hate but pays well. When we do the group interview bullshit we do the reverse stepbrothers. The company recently fucked me out of 10k. I tell ever prospective employee. 
Had a similar experience. Was waiting in the lobby to interview at Lockheed. 2 employees walk past escorting someone to the door they had just interviewed. Everyone is talking pleasantly, they hold open the door for the girl who just interviewed, she leaves.   As soon as the door closes they burst out laughing and start making fun of her. In the lobby, in front of other people waiting.   
Also, anytime they mention travel, ask how much of a heads up you get.  Almost worked at a place where trips TO KOREA were planned DAYS in advance.  Screw that I'm not about to tear apart my schedule last minute for shit like that. 
I just quit my latest job a few weeks ago and one of the things the girl training me said was, "if, no actually when (manager) pulls you up on something, don't say anything just agree even if he's got it wrong."  Lasted 7 months in the place and I honestly don't know how I got that far. The manager was an absolute cunt and everybody was terrified of getting on his wrong side. 
I had an interview with a company that offered 'software solutions'. Yes thats vague. For a half hour this guy asks me maybe 1 question and just rambles on about acronym after acronym. Software products i had never heard of before and that he clearly did not understand past memorizing their acronym. He then says i would eventually replace him. "Is that something you want to do?". Yea, uh no thanks. 
When I was getting into bartending, I applied at a local place that refused to pay you until you had done unpaid "training", even though I had served before and attended mixology school. I walked after the second day, in which I mostly cleaned.  Coincidentally, it burned down 6 months later.  
I had a similar experience with a major corporation.  I had a phone interview with the company recruiter, a phone interview with the prospective manager, then a round-robin of panel interviews that lasted five hours.  It was fucking exhausting.  They warned that the job would be excruciatingly busy, and told me that almost everyone comes in before 7 a.m.  It was flattering to be one of the three top candidates in the nation for a very well-known company, but I walked out of that final interview wanting nothing to do with that department. 
I once interviewed for a job and was offered the position on the spot. I told the guy I would need two weeks' notice for my previous job. He asked what my current schedule was, and I told him M-F. So he asked if I could swing by Saturday at 10AM since I had the day off, to "get me logged into the company computer system." I thought it was weird, but I lived close by and didn't really mind. I got there and he asked why I wasn't in dress code. I told him I had no idea he intended me to work right away, so I wore jeans. He said "That's okay... you can go home and change on your lunch break." That job did not last long. 
Go to costco instead- they have great employee benefits and high starting salary 
I like my job, my boss was like that during my interview. It turns out it's because he's a yes man all the time and basically just takes on too many tasks. My work is pretty independent so it ended up not affecting my job too much. I wouldn't say no to a job just because the boss seems stressed/rushed, but if you're matched with another job that's perfect it should tilt the balance. 
If I hear anything that sounds remotely like "work hard, play hard" I'm out.  I work hard,  but when employers say that,  I've learned it means they have zero respect for work life balance.  
They asked me about my hobbies, and I said develop apps and mobile games in my free time. Both of them laughed and one said "free time? Well, if we hire you you can say goodbye to that." And they didn't believe my previous employer was real because they'd never heard of it.  I got a rejection email that night at 9 PM. Couldn't have been happier. 
Why were you still in high school in your thirties? 
Do they not follow-up with the college to verify the degree? My alma mater has a search function on their website where you simply search my name and year I graduated and it will tell you my degree and that I did indeed graduate.   My degrees are framed and they sit in my office at home because nobody gives a shit about them - they are just pieces of paper.  As for the passport, I can't think of *any* reason a company would need to do that...unless it's a cult and they are afraid you will flee the country. 
Companies calling themselves "families" makes me angry. It's an insult to the word.  My last company loved to call its employees "the [company] family!" ...I ended up getting laid off via google hangout with no notice. My company email had been disabled before the conversation was even over, and people I talked to daily thought I was just on vacation for a week afterwards. I woke up with a job and discovered I no longer had one just before lunch. Some fucking family. 
I hated this shit when I was younger applying for department store jobs anyone could run. The Interviewers acted like he place was the big top of something. The worst was RadioShack. Had to drive 1 1/2 hours for an orientation thing. The district guy gave us a talk and was like, if you work hard, you can be just like *me*! No thanks.. you look miserable as shit. 
They dropped that one on me during my last job interview and it turned out differently.  In my case, "We work hard and play hard" is accurate *if* by "work hard" you mean *working at a very relaxed pace in a cushy office job* and by "play hard" what you mean is *sometimes we drink one beer together on Friday before everyone gets home to their families*.  Don't get me wrong I have no complaints with my work environment, but at this stage this expression is just a cliche that could mean anything and its opposite. 
"We refuse to hire enough people to get the job done without overworking everyone"  If you're salary, it's kind of expected - and there are times I'd say it's justified depending on your function, but if Joe down in packing has to work 60 hours a week, you're just not running the building effectively.  
I would have a hard time saying no. I just really like gallows humor. 
Yeah fuck that. I'll work overtime when needed, but I have a life. I have commitments.  
Please blink twice if you are being held against your will. 
Damn this is depressing just to read. I DONT WANT THE JOB 
This. A lot of people go into interviews like beggars. They're not giving you a handout, you're doing them a favor. They will get way more money out of you than they give you in return. That's how they afford to pay you. 
I was between jobs once and did a group interview to be a substitute teacher for a school district.  The group interview lasted 4+ hours and involved weird team-building exercises.  On top of that, they didn't respond to any of the candidates for the better part of a year.  In my case they were stunned that I was no longer available... 
Dude, I agree 100% with this. When I first started my job 1.5 years ago, they had name brand, soft toilet paper. I remember thinking "It's all these little things that show a good company". Now they have 1 ply shitty paper and we've had 3 people quit in the 2 weeks. Come to think of it, the change in toilet paper coincided with the change in culture.  
"Looking for highly-motivated people" = We expect you to do a lot of unpaid overtime. 
My boss said this countless times during my interview, and still says it occasionally.   I actually don't see it as a negative at all. We're a pretty small business so it's expected for everybody to do a lot of stuff. It gives my days variety and gives me experience in lots of different areas. Some of it sucks and I'd rather not do it, but some things are pretty cool and I wouldn't experience them if I worked at a bigger company and only wore one hat, so to speak. 
A friend of mine worked at Crate and Barrel, they had a designated nap room in the office. It was a ROOM though for God's sake, not a bed just sitting out there. She liked the job, for the record. 
Kinda related, I got contacted for an interview by a call center and when I came in they took me around, showed me the entire place. Offices, break rooms, like they were ready to hire me off my application alone. Got to the interview, it went well. Never heard from them again. I don't even know why they bothered with a 15 minute tour. 
I actually received an offer, was told to call and schedule a time to come in the next day for paperwork (it was a late afternoon interview). Called and was told that she did not realize I had small children when she made the offer, and after talking it over with her spouse (who didn't work there), decided I wouldn't be able to work full time and manage my family. I was already working full time and had applied there just to see where it would go. Bullet dodged, but it still pisses me off.  
Coffee at the office is sometimes the best part of the day - So, yeh. Good one! 
I find that's standard for any interview for a government job or highly structured company.  I had two interviews for different universities and they were both panel interviews with one HR, your future manager, and your manager's manager.  They all just read from a script of questions and wrote down my answers.  
how did they turn your answer into a weakness? was like it:  you: i believe teamwork is important to company success.  them: sounds like you can't do anything yourself lol *texts*  and yes they said lol outloud 
I think that "kool aid" is totally legitimate for some companies. Many companies are fantastic places to work with employee-focused culture and all kinds of non-financial benefits. The problem is that NO company can stay that way forever if they plan to grow. Things have to be standardized and refocused on profit and cost once you get past a certain size, so you see that original culture either fade away or just be drastically changed.  
I was asked in an interview, "if you could be any kind of animal, what kind would you be and why?" And I said, "why do you ask?" The interviewer (my future supervisor) said, "well, people are caught off guard and answer honestly. I had a woman tell me that she wanted to be a cat because they sleep all day and someone else takes care of all their needs. We didn't hire her." He gave a few other examples, too. I ended up saying, "obviously I would be a Clydesdale because I always work hard at a steady pace!" They laughed. I got the job offer.  Sometimes they ask stupid questions because stupid people will give answers that say a lot about who they are instead of stopping to wonder why they're getting asked such a stupid question. 
I see you haven't experienced the joys of Rochester NY, where the temps consistently are sub-zero in the winter, while in the summer you literally breathe mosquitoes.  Fuck Rochester. 
I live in South Florida.  Every day I leave my house, two contradictory thoughts go into my head:    "wow the weather is amazing, so happy to be here."  *2 minutes later*  "wow the people here are a mix of stupid, trashy and insane, wish I could live somewhere else."  Never fails 
Hey we have four seasons in the south as well:  Bugs, Air made of hot soup, Air made of soup that was left out, Cold-ish sometimes but not really  Edited to add commas, since making it look like a list on my phone apparently makes it something else on desktop.  
And hockey.  And skiing.    Winter sports are pretty damn fun.   
Bavaria here: no earth quakes, no tornadoes (well there are apparently 1 or 2 every now and then), no tsunamis, no dangerous or vicious predators (seriously the most annoying thing here is the occasional mosquito). It's usually temperate, not too warm, not too cold, not constantly raining, no droughts. It's generally very pleasant. Only some floodings now and then, but most of those are man's fault... 
I like how the top two comments are talking about opposite climates temperature wise.  
I agree! Heat definitely makes me very lethargic. I have no energy to do anything when its 115F (46C) out. Plus I get heat rash and sunburned very easily... I just think I was never meant to live in a desert.  
This. There is nothing like the feeling you get in the spring when everything comes back to life. The green seems so much brighter than I remember from the spring before, the sun feels warmer, the birds seem to sing prettier. As much as I don't like winter, I'd miss spring and fall ten times more if I didn't live in a place that experienced all the seasons. 
Ditto. The love of my life invited me. What was I supposed to do? 
Only other person who gets my riff raff perspective  
Your third point made me chuckle! I'm from a university town in Canada and its awesome watch all the international students freak out about the cold in November when the locals know...... oh they know 
Also if a zombie apocalypse ever does happen they will freeze before they get to us.  This only applies to the winter for me but it's a real quick jog to make that all year long. 
I believe it's the olfactory that produces the smell. 
For those of you in the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, Palau and the United States:  25C is 77 in Fahrenheit. 
"I've got trees and vegitation in the city I stay,  The (low) rent's in the mail, and I can always find a parking space.  The women outnumber the men two to one.  I got parks and zoos and things to do with my son.  The nightlife ain't all that, but that's ok:  I don't need to be distracted by the Devil everyday.  And the jobs ain't really too hard to find, in fact  You could have mine if you knew how to rhyme!  So roam if you must,   but come home when you've seen enough."  -"Shh" by Atmosphere, a pretty good list of why Minnesota is dope. 
Correct answer.   I grew up in Michigan. Once, in college, it was so cold as I walked across campus I had to stop at the school store and overpay for a winter hat just to feel okay walking to the class building OR walking back to my dorm. My fault for not having a hat, (yes mom, you told me so) but it was strange to literally feel unsafe without one.  For 6 months I lived in South Carolina, and in June and July it was mid 90s on a daily basis, creeping up to 100 semi-often. It was excruciating, I would dread leaving the house, delay grocery shopping until the evening and basically never be outside. And I'm a moderately active, moderately outdoorsy person. I just couldn't do it. I was practically homebound during daylight hours on weekends and I would stay up late and sleep in just so I could be up during the night more and be more active as a result.  Given the choice I would rather endure the Michigan winters than South Carolina summers.  
idk,NY is getting pretty bland, weather-wise.  We haven't had any really good snowstorms this year. 
I once ate from a bag of mixed nuts for about ten minutes before noticing a live cockroach crawling around in there. It was all covered in salt and looked like a little almond with legs. Wasn't using a straw though. 
I feel you. I had jaw surgery as well and my bottom lip and chin were numb, I got into the habit of wiping my mouth a lot when I ate because stuff would get on my chin and NO ONE would tell me. It took about 4-6 years for the full feeling to return to my chin. 
Or he was just testing to see if you'd take stupid advice for real. 
sighs, i try not to use them because of that video.   i hate it though when a waitress just tosses straws on the table. they wont take them back because they are dirty ( or the paper wrapper gets wet).  so even if i dont use it, it still does not save a straw.  i will use paper straws  
True, but when I used to work at Wendy's, we always tried to get the phone number of the girls who asked for a straw with their frosty.   Edit for those not getting it:     1. We were stupid horny teenagers.    2. Frosty are very thick shakes and quite difficult to suck through a straw.    3. In case you still haven't gotten it, if you an suck a bowling ball through a straw, then a horny teenage boy might extrapolate you could give a great blowjob.   Edit 2: I replied below, but it's getting missed.   I don't remember if anyone got a phone number, although we did attempt a lot. I never got a number while at work.  
Hmm, well if it's camels you're looking for, then there are four places. There's the Camel Hut, that's on third. There's camels are us, that's on third too. You got Put Your Butt On That Camel, that's on third. Swing Low, Sweet Camel... That ma... Matter of fact they're all on the same complex. It's the camel complex down on third. 
You let a man tell you how to live your life. Sounds like *you're* the bitch. 
It won't give you wrinkles as long as you also smile while sipping and you won't look crazy at all I promise  
same, i wasn't particularly pro or against straws before watching that film, but ever since when a straw comes in the drink i take it out. i just cant see a straw in my cup without thinking of ryan gosling saying "it looks like youre sucking on a tiny schwanz" and steve Carrell's lips just reaching out to locate the straw....  I dont think it even made me particularly anti-straw, it just makes me CONSIDER the straw everytime im given a drink and after considering it I decide to go without 
Well that's lame.  I'd instantly laugh then immediately ask if you were ok! I just don't get the "and that was the end of the date" outcomes in these kinds of situations. Like the person who you're on a date with has never tripped, cut themselves, etc.? People are weird.  
My dad got so fucking drunk, he wouldn't stop screaming "THE CUBS WON THE WORLD SERIES" for 2 hours and then he passed out 
Son of a bitch, the Sports Almanac was wrong by just ONE year... 
To be fair, that answer will apply to all major events they may ask you about  
I'm on the red line and we're about to hit Addison. Send help.  Everyone is singing. I fucking love it. 
I was coming here to see if anyone has a gif or video link to that. He was cheering before he even grabbed that ball! 
Theo Epstein could run for governor of California by basing his campaign around two words: drought buster. 
It's god tying up loose story ends before he fucks us all up.   That's right. I called it. Trump victory.  
I'm about 6 blocks from Wrigley Field. There is a mass exodus to the field right now. Complete pandemonium outside.  My dogs are confused. Pretty awesome! 
This girl named Becky Schwartz said she'd fuck me "when the Cubs win the world series". I don't know how to explain to my SO that I have to do this... 
Baseball has that weird magic and romance to it though. I can't follow it the whole season, it's too slow for me, but I love big sports moments anyway and tonight the slow speed really drew out the tension. Loved it 
Tomorrow night the Cubs will win the World Series again 
Enjoy that shit, this kind of thing will never happen again, you're in the middle of history 
That's how most of us feel I think. I don't know shit about baseball, but I've always heard about how the cubs are cursed. Good for them! 
This is why I really wanted the Cubs to win. I remember watching that game in 2004 on a tiny tv when I wasn't supposed to be awake because of school. They broke the curse and I got to see it as a sox fan. I'm so happy for the Cubs and their fans, it's a great feeling 
I'm totally biased since I'm a Cubs fan but I mean if you have to lose to someone, might as well be the team that hasn't won a championship in over a 100 years. 
I feel kind of bad, because I was raised as a Cubs fan, and I've always felt the love for them in my heart.  I grew up watching Andre Dawson, Mark Grace, Ryno, Greg Maddux, Sammy Sosa, all those goddamn greats.  Feeling that heartbreak in high school with the 03' team (losing with Wood and Prior...HOW?).  But I'm the type of guy who doesn't really have the patience to *care* through an entire 160+ whatever game baseball season.  So, I'm not really fairweather because I always keep tabs on the Cubs, but I also can't muster up much of a shit about baseball esp if the Cubs aren't good.  I suspect a lot of people have similar stories. 
I'm a server at Applebee's. I get excited when people ask for Shirley Temples, because I can respond by saying, "Surely!"  But nobody ever laughs.  
Trump vs Clinton. Let that sink in. We're in a crazy ass world. 
I feel the same way about my 93 year old grandpa! Say, he's looking for a girlfriend...  Let your gma know he *still* can drive ;)  not bad eh 
How many Cubs fans are going to die happy to have seen the Cubs win the World Series any ways? 
Isn't a baseball game always down to the last batter...? 
Ah we're past three. Leo won an Oscar remember? And all of those celebrity deaths. 
Lifelong Red Sox fan here. ALL HAIL THEO!!!!!   I was at that game in '04. Nothing compares to that feeling. I'm so happy for the Cubs! (and poor indians) 
Poor girl was probably holding them in all night and you happened to get up when sleep took over and she lost the fight against her body.  BEEN THERE lol  
If your name is Doug, I have to say you hid this one poorly.  
My dad was the same with my childhood cat. In everyones eyes he hated that cat, because it would always meow at his door to get let outside, and then meow at his window to get let in in the early morning.   Secretly, after a bad day, he would grab that cat, snuggle it like his life depended on it.   Ironically, my dad ran over the cat by accident. Dad also passed away shortly after. I like to picture them hanging out having a beer watching everyone.  
Wow what a fucking idiot. Like, why send a pic with him in the room goddamn  
He planned to propose for a year and a half before he did it?  Why?  Did he just get a good deal on a ring and buy it just in case? 
I just read this to my husband. He immediately got up and put a bag of croutons in the freezer. We're trying it tomorrow.   Update: Sorry it took so long but it makes them crunchier, which we like. Not bad, not bad at all. Much better than the cat food Tina Belcher told us to try. 
Damn dude, she risked giving you pink eye... the worst marriage transmitted disease you can get from sharing the same phone 
I had a friend who did this to all of her friends and her boyfriend... We figured it out but she never knew.  
Years ago, my wife quit smoking, but couldn't keep it up, so started again behind my back - I don't want her smoking, but I'm not going to stop her  I knew practically straight away (You can tell when a smoker goes from not smoked in a while, to having had one)  For months I kept hinting I knew she was keeping a secret, a few times even straight out asked her if she was smoking again, to which she denied.  In the end, she caved in and told me, and was confused as hell when I said I knew all along 
Some day when you are a distant memory he is going to think about you and feel sick to his stomach.  You deserve better; give yourself a chance. 
Whether it counts or not, I felt the cathartic waves from here, man. I'm sorry for the shitty ex, but the internet's listening to ya.  
This is kind of a blessing  Just let her walk away, don't escalate the convo into an argument (be fair and nonchalant)  Then immediately go to work on yourself: become a better person in different ways, and do exactly what you want to do  Your life doesn't need to depend on those that don't see value in you 
"Honey, you're not going to believe this. The guys are *dragging* me to the Stanley Cup finals tonight. I didn't ask for it, but really it would be rude of me to say no." 
As the opposite half of that equation. I fell back in love with my wife. Fairly recently actually. We have been together 15 years now. Rough spot about 5 years ago. Separated for a year. Got back together. Honestly, in the last year, it's really going well. I am back in love again. Just letting you know, there is hope. Couples therapy helped. But we both had to do slot on our own. And the biggest piece for me was that I needed to see she was truly making an effort.  
This happened with my wife and a friend - before I knew her. Actually, it is only because I am friends with him that I met her.  He encouraged our dating.  I don't know if she knows that I know that they had a little thing, no reason it ever needed to come up really.  I don't feel any resentment toward her but to be completely honest I have a small amount of (unreasonable) resentment toward him.  He is a super nice, genuine guy so I am chalking this up to a biological, human condition.  
Five of us in a skype call playing LOL together. One of my buddies just starts reading off some recent comments from my reddit account all nonchalantly. Will never forget that immense feeling of panic. Now when i post things i have to make sure id be ok with my buddies ragging on me for it haha.  
Sounds exactly like my ex. In addition to all the excuses you listed, I also got "it's mouthwash I used in the car after work" quite often.  He came stumbling home drunk a couple times and once with a severe head injury and I had to drive him to the emergency room.  When I left him, he told his family, my family, and all my friends I cheated on him so he was filling for divorce. Most of them still believe it and this happened almost 7 years ago. 
Oh god this reminds me of me:( when I first started dating my bf, I was super shy to use the bathroom or toot or anything in front of him. Well one night I'm hanging out at his place with his friend who I had just met for the first time, and I get a stomach ache. I  ended up clogging the toilet big time (I used to be really bad about the amount of tissue I used) and he didn't have a plunger. I had to leave the mess in there, tell him what happened, and then go purchase a plunger from the store. First, buying just a plunger by itself at the store is embarrassing enough, but then I had to walk through the living room where my bf and his friend are hanging out with the damn thing! Very VERY embarrassing but luckily we all had a laugh and now me and my bf have been together for almost 5 years :)  
I came home from 3 months abroad having left my boyfriend to care for my pets. According to my African Grey parrot there was someone by the name Linda that did "something" very good. She also kept calling people "Fucking Shmuck " and demanding that they get her a beer. She had also master the sound of a gurgling bong and followed it with loud coughing sounds and the occasional "BOOYAH!"   Sounded like he had a lot of fun. 
Hey I do that too! And I did the exact same thing, telling a girlfriend I loved her while almost asleep. I didn't realize it until the next day when she brought it up in front of her friends. I said I was drunk and didn't mean it. That relationship ended two weeks later.  
You know what's amusing, this far into the thread so far...I forgot it was "worst" secrets....I've been enjoying everything regardless. 
I've walked in on my husband watching Gilmore Girls more times than I can count. 
Aw that's adorable :) I'm happy for you dawg.      
I'd start with breaking up with her. Then go buy yourself a steak.  
That's very sad. :( My aunt and uncle got divorced because my uncle couldn't handle being married. (They were still dating, just no longer in the same house). When talking with the marriage counselor, they realized my uncle actually had severe aspergers the whole time. Once he started getting treated for it, they remarried and are pretty happy together, because now they know what's going on. Hopefully there's hope for you and him, if my aunt and uncle got things to work 
My gf hates when I oversleep on a regular basis, so she plays with my cock when I'm supposed to wake up.  Jokes on her, I still oversleep every time. 
My ex told me before we married that he was disqualified from driving after drink driving. He had to retake his test. I later discovered that this wasn't true at all - he'd never even had lessons before, let alone passed his test and then been disqualified. He was such an arse that he preferred me thinking he'd got done for drunk driving, than knowing the truth - that he'd never learnt to drive. Idiot.  
Fun fact: Pearls were considered to be the most precious jewel in the world for centuries while diamonds are actually quite a common gem. Your SO has taste. 
She might still be telling the truth. I don't want kids and I can't have them anyway. 
I had a crazy ex accuse me of hitting her, which is absolutely untrue. One thing I said that immediately made her stop was that when she says that she minimizes the experience of women who have actually been abused. For some reason that really worked and she never said that again 
Going through this right now and I can't find it in me to forgive his friends for the way they treated me. I see you're speaking in past tense, may I ask what happened? 
Dude. How much has to happen before you GTFO? That will not be the last crazy shit she does. Not at all. 
I do this to my wife,  if she wakes up she punches me(for waking her up not feeling her up) maybe if she went topless it would help.  
I went through hundreds of comments here and THIS is the one that made my jaw drop open. You are living a bad adult romance novel, my friend.  
He sounds fantastic. Can I borrow him for a hot sec? 
They probably interpreted it as asking, "What is the worst-kept secret your so is hiding from you?" 
If you don't break it off now, you'll get complacent and end up marrying her. You'll be married for the most miserable 10 years and she'll get alimony and child support. 
I apparently did something like this. I don't really like cuddling when I'm awake. It's hot and breathing through her hair / my face right next to her neck is uncomfortable. But apprently I used to really cling to her when I was asleep. Weird. 
Out of curiosity, why are you getting him something so thoughtful when it seems he's looking for the first opportunity for greener pasture?  Obviously a relationship is much more complex than a few words, but yeah. 
I'm with you bacon, I too was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome, well, at age 10. I know exactly where you're coming from. What I've sorta picked up on is that you have to have your own "script" to conquer social encounters. Like somebody asks what's up and I say, Man I'm rockin n rollin! Get brave, accept the fact that you'll fuck up. It's okay to get teased a little as long as you draw a line somewhere. I didn't accomplish my social awkwardness till late in highschool, but it doesn't end. Thing is, you end up being so proud of yourself that you forget your problem being a "problem".  
A friend of mine explained it to me like "Imagine you're meeting someone new and right out of the gate they dump "I got molested as a child so that's kind of like a duck in cold weather."  You'd have a fearful mix of "holy shit wtf do I say now?" but also "wait, what do they actually *mean* by that?".   And you get that feeling for almost every conversation, with everyone, forever.  I'm not jealous. 
The therapist who diagnosed me once told me this story about how one of her patients basically thought "Why is everyone so fucking weird?" for about 17 years before he got diagnosed, because he genuinely didn't realize that _he_ might be the odd one. That's me, as well. 
I actually think that we have too much empathy. I often times get visibly upset when I feel I hurt someone.  
This really.  I personally have some ADHD thrown into the mix, so the concentrating really well part is out of the window for me. Unless it's something I'm interested in doing. Like theres a,certain threshold of interest that needs to be present to start high concentration mode. 
I wish you many smiles and happy thinking :) I am glad I could make you smile. It is hard sometimes and it is scary but there are ways to make life better. Never just go "they have autism they can't do ____" Because sometimes they can and other times they may not be able to say put their socks on, but they can get the socks and ask for help to put them on. Its not the same but its better than just assuming they have no understanding of the socks. Thank you kindly for your response. 
My step daughters go to the climbing gym with a boy with autism. And last summer all the parents of his assotiation went to a mountain refuge. The mother told me that it was great because all of them were parents or children with autism, so nobody look at them weird when the kids had a meltdown or escape, they didn't have to excuse themselves or apologize for their children. It was incredibly relaxing for them 
Except it would be raspberried by the bike seat.   "ppppppppffffffffFFFFFFFFTTTTTTtttttttrr" 
It's already really weird to watch a live recording of the beatles. Why go to a fucking concert if all you're gonna do is shriek?  
Here's the catch, in this world when a man gets aroused his dick begins singing, "Hello my baby, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal." 
What on earth are you doing at your local library? 
There's an alternative universe where this happens. There's a Reddit thread in that universe asking how life would change if vaginas bled every month. It's heavily downvoted and everyone thinks the guy who posted it is really weird.  
Let's get down to business!   To defeat the Huns   Did they send me whistlers, when I asked for sons?  
Alright ladies hit the showers.     *Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeee^eeeee^eeeeee 
Oh joy. Thousands of screaming 13 year old girls with whistling pussies.  
#JUST BECAUSE IT'S TEA TIME DOESN'T MEAN IT'S D TIME.  
I don't think he would question it, he'd just automatically assume he's dropping panties. And everyone else would be telling him "grow up, it's just your tinnitus."   
Try whistling with your lips together.  It would sound like the campfire scene in Blazing Saddles  
Nah, tea pots were clearly invented after the human vagina had been around for a while, so Britain would be the most disgusting and vile country there is when it comes to hardcore perversion. Like, Amsterdam and Bangkok rolled into one, dipped into 4chan's furry board and neatly wrapped into the used underpants of a Japanese schoolgirl, and that in country form.  Why else would an entire nation get together, at a designated time, every day, regardless of age, to listen to some contraption make sounds like an aroused woman and then all share into the often yellowish liquid it producers?  Like, c'mon, Britain.  We're all ashamed and disgusted over here. 
Even worse would be calling her while you're at work and just hear intense whistling in the backround.  
Or maybe a slide whistle sound and then when he goes flaccid again, it's a slide whistle going down 
So do you mean spitroasting as in over a fire or like strapping on a dildo and going for the peg because it could honestly go either way 
Sounds interesting. Is there a link?  *Edit* I tried to Google and search on Reddit with no luck. Idk if it's true. 
Is that why my husband randomly started peeing in the sink? Goddammit 
Fucking Christ. Reminds me of another story where some guy on a forum supposedly posted a way to make some crystals - that turned out to be highly toxic and hospitalised a few people, with a couple of deaths.  Could just be a myth for all I know, but it's scary. 
I remember last time this was brought up in a similar thread! and he showed up and kept on trying to explain that he was massively misunderstood and that he loved her...it was like he just couldn't listen to anyone saying that was he was doing was scary and that he was obviously sick...it was really disturbing. 
I remember that post so well too because I read a line that was like "The police don't have the thousands of minds working on this like we do." and just thought "I'm not sure that is how things work." then sure enough a day or so later they caught a guy and was harassing his family before any actual proof. 
I think I remember seeing something similar, but a girl planned to go to Europe with her best friend, the mom, and her new boyfriend. Last minute the girls parents decide she can't go, and the girls best friend and mom is never heard from again, although they promised to call as soon as they landed.  
That's total bull though. Guy claimed to have fought at Normandy despite being 13 at the time. My grandfather joined up at 15 and that was a stretch in itself.   There are tons of inconsistencies in this whole story. It just seems like a sophomoric creepypasta type deal.  
I believe the only information they got right was that there was in fact a bombing.  
Similar to this: the guy on 4chan who messed with a handgrenade and flushed it down the toilet. The next day there were news articles about an explosion in someones apartment that originated from the pipework and im pretty sure someone died. Either it was him or the grenade made his way through the pipes and killed his neighbor or something 
20th largest website on earth. Yeah, it has baggage with it. 
Reddit is actually trash.  Every post related to a woman being raped gets two kinds of replies: Doubt and "Men can be raped too!!".  Redditors are trash. 
I remember this. It was in a semi bad area, looked shady from the outside, and the staff refused to talk with the guy investigating. So he decided it was a drug front or something. IIRC it turned out to be a legit day care. 
That sounds like the saddest short story ever written. 
For insurance? Maybe he took two pictures to make sure at least one of them was good? Doesn't seem anything special to me. 
No, they weren't beautiful! The sub said 'cute corpses'!  Seriously though. 
I came here to say the Ask a Rapist thread, that was the most disgusting and deplorable thing I have ever seen here.  
Explanation for others: dude posts a long series of stories about how he discovers his wife cheating on him, turns out it was all fake. 
Id seen that sub before and felt bad for some of them  (Im sure theres some nice ones) but felt like it was just a woe is me, pity party circlejerk.  Visited it after your link and holy fuck.  Some dude whos a frequent poster also openly advocates for raping women and says it isn't a bad thing.  WTF.  
Wasn't it r/sexyabortedfetuses ? I was new to reddit and that was my first time realizing how fucked up this place can get 
Power users are a plague on websites like Reddit and it's a good thing that he's gone. When a guy comments on a subreddit and is getting upvoted to the top no matter what he says, it's not healthy for Reddit.  
My day isn't a day until I talk about a cumbox, or vaginal bacon 
This was a big enough fuck up that it was written into an episode of the HBO show Newsroom.   
And to add the cherry on top, he's a mod on /r/incest now 
Never knew the full story about Victoria. She was literally the only admin *everyone* loved and was absolutely fantastic at her job. 
Really wish someone would have noticed earlier I was on a 14 month drinking binge. I've stopped now though. Just gotta shed the pounds the booze added.  
I'm thinking that my roommate might be super depressed after reading this. I know he wouldn't want me confronting him and telling him if he needed my help, to just ask. Hell, he does need it, and maybe i'll take him to a movie or some shit. Fucker needs to get out of the house. He complained so hard about the pizza place not delivering last night, pasted huge facebook rand on how he was so hungry but couldn't get any food, and I was like, dude, we live 10 min walk from a grocery store. Then he sorta shut down and became unresponsive till he went to bed. haha fuck  
I don't think I've ever have nor ever will relate to a reddit comment so much... and unfortunately it's not a good thing... Damn son 
Or under reacting to everything, big or small. Almost having no reaction to any problem no matter how much it involves them and just fixes it in silence practically on auto pilot, or just walks away not caring. 
Goddamnit. I just had a near mental breakdown trying to cook salmon. This hits home. 
Calling in sick a lot is/was my thing.  Just too hard to get moving.  Started not taking a shower every day..went to every other day...then every third day.  On the fourth day, I'd call in sick.   When I would make it in to work I'd get lots of, "how are you feeling?", "how's your health?", "are you sick?"  These questions made it worse for me because I couldn't answer or felt that I had to lie and make up some random sickness.  These people don't really care and besides if I were to answer I'd completely break down into a blob of tears and wailing.  Just be happy I'm there and assign me something that will keep me busy.  That was the best way to keep me coming back each day. 
I actually use how much time I spend on Reddit as a rough way to gauge my mood. The more time I spend here, the worse I seem to be doing.     
I don't mind sharing details about my life, it's just going to be generally uninteresting. I will avoid talking about how I feel though, for the simple reason that I can't tell you myself. My answer from birth has been "I'm fine". 
This could also mean they're a waiter or shop attendant on a 14- hour shift. 
The best you can do is chalk it up to experience and realise you are a better individual for understanding how not to go about things. If you feel guilt and regret then the present you is not the same person who fucked up. 
Undersleeping and oversleeping can both by signs of depression. So can changes in sleep patterns or changes in diet/food consumption. 
I teeter on the edge of extreme joy and crippling loneliness most of the time. This thread is half of who I am. 
I am an avid daydreamer and I feel emotionally violated. 
I've noticed that I tend to laugh with other people even when I didn't hear the joke or understand it correctly. After I do anyways I ask myself, "why am I like this." Nothing other than what I've already known I suppose. 
Or can't focus like they used to. Sometimes even reading a book can be a struggle. 
Me too. I pace around my house doing nothing but thinking for hours on end in dead silence. I go to the window, peek outside continuously, and go back to pacing. I must look like a crazy, caged animal. In a way, I am.  
I feel like former depressives have a more realistic outlook than other people. And we can appreciate moments that should be enjoyed and not just be mindlessly happy.  
I do this all the time... so people *can* see through the act, huh? haha 
Hey man coming from a clinically depressed guy, that is what depression is. Its a numb feeling where happiness is not felt. Depression does not always equal sadness, its the lack of happiness, please get help now. 
i know people like this  they're unbearable  primarily because i'm exactly like that, too... ive just been making an effort to shut the fuck up if i've got nothing positive to say lmao 
This needs to be higher. The happy person, especially socially happy person, can be secretly very depressed. Double points if they're trying to make other people happy, or pretty funny.  Robin Williams is actually a very good example of this. Comedians in general, really. 
There's a great quote I recently heard, "I'd rather be condemned than pitied." 
So in other words, any behavior that is on either extreme end of the spectrum.  Or they drive a Chevy Cobalt. 
Not everyone who does these things in the thread are unhappy but pretty much every unhappy person does these things, if that makes sense. 
Gotta shake your butt or the device every few seconds if you're standing and talking (depending where it's mounted). One starts beeping everyone does a wiggle. They turn on when you turn on your SCBA tank.  I'd never seen or thought of them in relation to 9/11. That's pretty chilling. 
All the other last words, and then the Polish Airforce with just "fuck" 
Found footage because it was recorded by the SOSUS listening network and nobody knew they had it until later. 
When I was in a high school, a girl a little older than me was kidnapped from a mall near our house. She was walking to her car and these guys pulled up next to her in their car. One pointed a gun at her and told her to get in the car. She did, and what they did to her afterwards was horrific (she did not survive). My mom told me if that ever happened to me, to just refuse to go because it would be better to be hurt or killed right there in a parking lot than go through what that girl did. 
He was apparently so creepy that, even though he won, the contestant refused to go on a date with him. 
Well, he wasn't a corpse so I'd say that the ending was a happy one.  
That guy was kind of an idiot. I hate that his dumb choices were romanticized the way that they were. 
That was from the video for "Down In It", which released back in 1989. In it, Trent Reznore appears to throw himself off a building and fall to his death. Trent had to prove IN COURT that he was still alive. 
same, reading this at 1am in Aus so I have to be careful.  
Perhaps even grandma was abused herself and that could be what drove her to do it. 
Damn. That guy was fully responsible for his own death, you just happened to be there. Lucky he didn't take you with him.  It's a shame, but double the speed limit in the middle of the night with no lights? 100% his fault. 
To hold a stranger's hand in his final moments. You are a beautiful person. I hope you are okay now.  
That seems like it should have definitely been at least a two person job. 
And don't make illegal u-turns like a dumbass. That would've solved the issue.  
Thats not your fault. You didn't let somebody too drunk drive. Thats what you're *supposed* to do. 
He got to spend his last few days with his grandkids, and helping his child through a rough patch. If you could ask him, I bet he wouldn't regret his decisions at all. 
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown? 
You can't live your life at the beck and call of everyone else. It's healthy to take time for yourself. I'm sorry that this happened in this case and I understand why you feel guilty, but you couldn't have known. 
As part of my job, I work with seniors to improve their reflexes and balance.  These are things that degrade with age.  In most demographics, falls kill more older adults than anything other than heart disease and cancer.  People with good balance and quick reflexes rarely seriously injure themselves from a fall.  Your grandfather in his younger years could have recovered from his misstep, or could have gotten his arms out in front of him in time.  Frailty, decline, and bad luck killed your grandfather, not you.  It could have been a crack in a sidewalk. 
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide.   It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault.  
I wonder how many lives you unknowingly saved by repoing someone's car. 
It may take or have taken you a long time to believe this, or maybe you never will, but you did him a really big favour.  
I had a similar but less serious incident as an adult in Taiwan. A friend dropped me off at the place I was staying. I opened the door on the kerb side and a kid on a bicycle slammed into it. He was ok, a few scratches. What some may not realize is that sidewalks are uncommon in Asia and so the area between buildings and cars is still road. The reaction of my friends suggested this was my fault and I should have looked before opening the door. 
You aren't clairvoyant. I know you're in this profession to help and I completely understand the frustration, anger and sadness that comes with hindsight, but please don't beat yourself up when all of your efforts and training don't turn out to be magic. Focus on the people you do save, while still having sympathy for the ones you couldn't. I'm positive the former outweighs the latter.  
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.    I'm sorry for your loss man. 
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you?  
You say that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but hey, you're alive. Sure, it would be great if that man had survived, but if he had been in front of you, you'd be the dead one, and he'd be typing up this comment now. I know that it sucks that you had to be involved in something like this, but fate works in cruel, yet mysterious ways. Maybe the guy would have died the next day from a heart attack or something? I know, still awful to think about, but look on the bright side: at least you weren't texting and driving. If that had been the case, then yeah, it would have been a lot more awful if someone had died because you were distracted, but that's not what happened. The other guy just got really unlucky that day. 
Neither of you knew about his condition.  He was essentially a ticking-time bomb.  The circumstances of it suck, but it's not your fault. 
Hey, it might not have been your kit that was used. Even if it was, you had no way of knowing what would happen. 
My buddy did this to me so I replied "boo" and he said "boo who?" Nervously as things were no going to plan for him.  "Aw are you crying because I fucked up your joke?"

This I like. Here's mine:  How can you fit four elephants into a Mini Cooper? Two in the front, two in the back.  How do you kill a blue elephant? With a blue elephant gun.  How do you kill a red elephant? With a red elephant gun.  How do you kill a pink elephant? You choke it 'til it's blue, and you shoot it with a blue elephant gun.  How can you tell if there's an elephant in your refrigerator? Because there's tracks in the butter.  How can you tell if you have two elephants in your refrigerator? You can hear them giggling.  How can you tell if there are three elephants in your refrigerator? Because the door closes, but only just.  How can you tell if you have four elephants in your refrigerator? Because there's a Mini Cooper parked outside. 
Nice try, German. You'll never develop your own weaponized joke. 
A snake walks into a bar.  The bartender says, "How'd you do that?"

Was she disabled? I don't see any other reason besides that for not being able to just do it herself. Or maybe she had some kind of traumatic freak out doing it herself so he tried and got freaked out too? I don't know. 
Way to stop a secret agent you dick. Mr. Hoover is going to be pissed when he finds out you foiled his plans    
How does one "do it right"? I'm genuinely curious.  
This has some twisted backwards karma going on. Let a murderous psychopath go, then a murderous psychopath lets him go.

An overlooked sign of abuse, I feel, is when a kid is way too mature and cool-headed for their age. That 12-year-old knew exactly what to do and how to protect her brother from the sight - which means she either had to do so before, or was mentally prepared for the possibility. 
Wow.  To think that this could have been how I ended up. Except I survived my time in the dumpster and was rescued weighing 2 lb.  Thank you guys for what you do. 
yikes, this one is awful and would've been so creepy to see in person. 
One of my work colleagues was on jury duty for a case where a lady of the evening died on the freeway after falling out of a pickup truck. The driver's defense was that "out of nowhere, for no reason, she just opened the door and jumped out while we were in the middle of the freeway."   
It's one thing to want to take your own life, but how dare you take someone else with you. 
She stared a literal dagger at you and you just went on by? Damn. 
god damn...that sounds weird as fuck. i didn't know blood did that either. 
I was at the hospital drunk as hell at like 2am a couple months ago (went to the bars with some friends and a female friend got drugged and no one wanted to take her to the hospital). I hear a lot of noise so I open the curtain and there's a guy covered in blood. According to the nurse he was high on Meth and picked huge chunks of skin off and cut himself. If I was any more intoxicated you could have convinced me the zombie apocalypse was happening just by the looks of him.  
Oh man, I bet they hung themselves in the attic so their kids didn't walk in on that sight. 
Burglar/necrophiliac was pretending to be a corpse and ran out when you weren't looking.  Or the start of the next Mummy movie. 
See, I do my best not to be an overprotective parent, then I read shit like this. 
What was the outcome? If you could still smell the alcohol the person must have still been around. 
"Attention pumpkinfucker!  Do you need assistance?!" 
You know it's going to happen, but I wonder how the dogs handle this psychologically on the back end given the pack/owner relationship? 
This is the reason my 4 year old knows the proper words. And I am thankful for it since she was able to tell me a couple months ago that her older half brother had put a Nerf bullet up her vagina.         The matter has been investigated and is being dealt with.    She has not been to her fathers house since the incident happened.       ETA - in the thread below there is more information about the incident.      I am done for the night on responding as I have now given my self a headache from thinking about it and need to just unwind and not think about the situation for a bit.     Thank you all for your support and kind words.    
When you say he was resisting. Do you mean he was trying to assert his dominance? 
that's enough internet for today. How fucking sickening and tragic.  
Having been on the other side of that, I gotta say your mind illogically defaults to "not mine" faster than you can weigh the consequences of confessing. You know how that's going to go, you know resistance is futile, you know it's better to confess and accept that you've been busted...but no way, that's not yours. 
Yeah, it's not like he could have use the money he saved from dinner to pay for a movie ticket or something. 
I pictured this from the point of view of the soaring bagel for some reason 
Say what you want, but I respect that she saw she was acting like that, and instead of taking what her daughter told her as an insult, actually thought to give her grandson a good first bday and go cool off. Crazy, but self aware enough to know to go calm the hell down. 
That is someone who is on day 13 of their two week notice. 
That's correct. We don't care about your cheeseburger  
Plot twist: there's no sensor it's just a guy watching the cameras waiting for peak rage before he opens the gate. 
I hope their son grows up to be well adjusted and not follow in his parents footsteps and become a raging douchebag. I hope, but it's unlikely.  
a friend of mine feels this way about his GF's mother. She is legit batshit crazy. She makes passive aggressive comments to him if he is ever near her, and most of the time she just ignores his existence because in her mind, her daughter should be with some rich lawyer or doctor. But her real lunacy comes with her family. She treats her husband like a dog (even though he is the one holding her leash) and she started leveraging herself against her daughter so she would break up with my buddy. She stopped helping her pay fro nursing school, she took away the car that was in their name (even though her daughter paid for most of it), and during one of their arguments, she was riding with her mom and gets tired of her shit and told her to stop the car, she was getting out. The car comes to a stop, and she almost gets out, but her mom just floors it, almost knocking her out of the car. Total loony. 
I will never understand the people who try to buy coffee in the mornings and then complain they're going to be late when it's not ready in 2.5 seconds. At the Starbucks I go to, this happens every morning. It's like, dude, if waiting 2 minutes for your coffee is going to cause you to be late, you were already running late. It's not the employees' fault at that point.  
To be fair, the McDonalds near me literally never puts the sauce in the bag and i have to go back and ask for it everytime. Its frustrating, but hell, I'm not gonna act like a fucking 5 year old and assault people with it. Fuck that guy 
My daughter thinks it's the coolest thing in the world to see a dog with a job. It just blows her mind lol. She does know not to mess them.  
Hospitality industry nightmares. I work in a small boutique hotel with no security and a couple of years ago a guest had a nervous breakdown that lasted for about two hours. Her husband left her in the city center and she somehow couldn't get back to the hotel, started blaming us. Accused us all of being racist because she's Iraqi, accused the taxi driver of wanting to rape her, got in my face to the point I thought she was going to hit me. She was screaming so loudly the other guests locked themselves in their rooms.  It was the worst thing I have ever witnessed from a human being.  
The manager has some spectacular timing...almost like they were waiting until assface left. 
Doesn't sound that hard, I mean, $150, what could that be? Like 15 bananas?  
Being kind, polite, and reasonable to airline employees has always netted me the biggest favor payouts for literally the least amount of effort. Seriously.   
I don't know that I follow.  If they were both facing each other (head on?), why would one be trying to pass the other?  
When I worked as a cashier at a supermarket, our bag boy was sent to run and pick up a jar of jam for a customer ringing up who forgot to grab it ('cause he wasn't doing anything, she had a long order, and she had been decently nice thus far). When he brought it back it was apparently sugar free, and this pissed her off and she threw it at the customer service desk in anger and it exploded everywhere.   Also had several people go nutso and start throwing food when they got angry. Milk was the worst, followed by yogurt and glass items. Thankfully they never threw wine.   This was at a fancy grocery store too. In a nice part of town. People were just ridiculous occasionally.  
No doubt in my mind that he opened a few bags to cherry pick and stuff the one bag he was so insistent was sold by the the bunch as well. I know that type of shopper, that's why he got so pissed, all that effort for naught. 
fucking with airport security is typically a quick way to not get on your flight and be treated to a shiny new pair of steel bracelets. did she not get hauled away for this?  
I work with a rage-a-holic also. She snaps at everyone about the most miniscule things and management dismisses her bad behaviour because she's "had a hard life", but when I point out that half of the people in here have had a hard life and don't act like that, I'm the asshole.  
I can see that place pushing mild-mannered parents into full-on freakouts. Like, when I was a kid, I never understood why my mom and dad were total dicks on our big group family vacations to Florida - now that I've pulled a few family vacations as leadership (along with my wife), it's easier to see how the stress gets to you.   Throw in high expense and a well-intentioned pressure to provide your family with a total white-glove experience and I get why some people might freak out. Hell, I could see *myself* losing my shit in that heat/cost/general situation.  
Once that guy was sober, I'd insist that he pay everyone back, as the decent thing.  
Obviously she knew that you were secretly The Weather God and the lifeguard thing was just a cover.  I was behind a couple in a store that spent 5 minutes bitching to the cashier about the traffic (there had been a bad accident nearby, the traffic was horrible).   The cashier got fed up, and with a deep voice announced "Traffic Begone!" while waving his hands at the windows.  He paused, turned back to the couple and said "well, obviously my superpowers are gone."  The couple was just so stunned they shut up, paid and left.     
I used to work in an ice cream parlour and the amount of abuse hurled at us was ridiculous. I've worked other customer service jobs, but there's something about ice cream that brought out the worst in humanity.  
I  had a roommate like this, She would go shopping and max out her credit card and then her parents would pay it off repeatedly. She was storming around one day calling her mom a bitch because her mother had asked her to try not to go shopping as much. 
I was expecting the opposite reaction where you all pretend that nothing is happening and avoid eye contact with one another. But I guess there are some instances where one must intervene. I had one of those the other day where I had to call the police when someone in front of me was violently mugged.  
LOL.  I would have responded, "Listen, I can explain this to you, or a police officer can explain this to you." 
Why are people bringing their tissues out of the toilet and putting it in a bin, instead of flushing it down the toilet? 
Wasn't married, but my one and only ex likes to get drunk (alcoholic) and occasionally text me "I hope you fucking die" "fuck you cunt, die" "I hope you fall off a bridge" "I'm gonna drink myself to death tonight and it's your fault"  Aren't people great.  High five for the single life.

When I was 19, a guy once tried to fight my friend after my friend supposedly cut him off in traffic.  I was in the passenger seat, and this guy pulled up next to us at a red light, rolled down his window and started screaming.  My friend, who just has a gift for pushing buttons, kept needling the guy until the guy looked like he was about to have an aneurysm.  The guy gets out of his horribly-painted camo low-rider pickup truck, takes a few steps towards our car, and my friend laughs, waves, and takes off as the light changes to green.  In the rearview mirror, we watched as two lanes of traffic start angrily honking at this guy because he's blocking one lane and his car is blocking the other. 
Say something.  Couples can tend to get absorbed in themselves and fail to have an outside perspective that could help them.  "I'd like to come over but your husband's outbursts make me a bit uncomfortable at times, would you like to go out to eat alone instead?"  Make the problem clear but also make it clear you aren't avoiding them, you're just avoiding the situation.  Which is fair - he isn't your husband, you shouldn't have to put up with that the same way. 
oh my god, how hideous for your great grandmother. to have to go through the grief of losing him not once but twice... life is so fucking cruel. 
I'm sorry for your losses, they both passed away too early. 
I have an aunt who is twice widowed (my late uncle was her second husband) and lost a son in a car accident. What you said about Facebook pretty much sums up her timeline. My uncle has been dead for 8 years, her son a few years longer, and first husband even longer than that. I can't imagine carrying so much grief for so long. 
This is honestly the possibility that terrifies me. She's got a chronic disease that will likely kill her relatively early, but at least we know about that and can sort of see things coming, even if it's going to be sudden if it happens. This, though... you plan for all the known variables, you think you're ready, then something totally unexpected happens and throws it all out the window. Life happens, and that's the scariest fate of all. 
Hug her tight. My dad died on the way to work. This thread has made me sad :( 
This is sad and sweet at the same time. I'm glad they found each other.  
Fucking dreams, my dad passed away in 2010 and I still dream he is alive and I know he is dying but I haven't spent enough time with him before he dies. Stupid brain, my dad was paliative for over 6 months and I had plenty of time with him before he passed away, but NO, my brian has to try to screw with me 
My mother said something similar about her first husband who died young. I was always conscious that her great love wasn't my dad but she told me that it wasn't fair to compare as they only had a few years and who knows how they would have ended up.  
I'm a widower too and have tried to start dating again recently. Acceptance is one of the biggest parts of grieving, and to try and think what I'd do if she were still here...well I can't even process that question. Like you said, it hurts to just read it.  
Sorry for your loss. It's an interesting discussion though. At 35, I am totally different to who I was at 20 when I met my partner, but we've grown together.   If I met the 19 year old her we'd probably not get on and if I met the 34 year old her without having been together in the interim, we might be totally different people too.  We are so shaped by the people close to us, it's impossible to say how different we'd be without them (or rather with different ones) 
Sending a hug your way! I am sorry for your loss.  
I like this. Before my nana died last summer, we were talking about how she hadn't remarried even years after my grandpa died. She said "why settle for hamburger when you've had steak all your life?" 
Stay strong. If you ever need to chat, please hit me up. You mean the world to someone and you matter to this world. All the best. Strength and love to you. 
My grandfather unexpectedly died in his 30's from a medical issue. My grandmother eventually met and married a man who also lost his spouse. In the end, they were married about four times longer than either of their first marriages, yet they both decided to be buried next to their first spouse.  It surprised a lot of people, but it was a decision based on logic more than choosing one person over another. Both had children from their first marriage and they never had any children together. They decided they wanted their children to be able to visit both their parents at the same place. My grandmother said she didn't really care where her body was since she wasnt going she be using it, so she thought about the people who would care. Even in death, she's doing her best to avoid inconveniencing others. 
Yikes. Was he suffering from any known mental illnesses or stuff like that? 
I think the talking about your grandfather is mostly because for some reason earlier memories get preserved better. Towards the end my grandmother would often ask my grandfather to go home to her parents :/ 
Was everything ok in your relationship when he announced his desire to transition? You mentioned the thing about being at the height of the relationship when a partner dies, do you feel like you were there at that time?   Was he happy in the relationship (though obviously not in himself)?   Did he want to stay with you after transitioning?    Ignore me if these are too personal, I'm just really interested.  
That whole show is full of "what would you do?" scenarios. I can't wait for the second season! 
Is a mistress a mistress if she doesn't know she's helping someone cheat? 
There's a French series called Les Revenants which has a similar dynamic between a now married woman, her ex that committed divide and her new husband. It's Kinda about zombies but they're not rotting and stuff, they just look normal but keep coming back from the dead. Think there's an American adaptation. 
I find it a very interesting question. Better than most questions asked here. 
Man. My "shelf broke" when I was 17 but the whole zombie sister wife/unmarriable widow double standard was always hard to choke down. Especially since it was highlighted in my favorite books, Tennis shoes among the Nephites. Men can have eternal marriages after their wives die. If a widow tries to remarry it's  not a "binding" marriage--it's a marriage for the next few years until her original spouse claims her in the afterlife. It devalues widows (who were specifically noted (by Jesus Christ)  as a group that should receive community support ) and makes them into concubines.  Blargh. R/exmormon is love. R/exmormon is not life cause religion or lack there of should never define your life.  
Sir, are there you aware that our planet is spherical? 
My exhusband is convinced that whomever you marry first is who you are forced to spend eternity with, and keeps accusing me on Twitter of screwing him out of a good afterlife. Uh... no.  
Last weekend I went with my mother to a memorial and on the way back we passed a car with their lights off. I gave him a quick flash of my lights and the other car immediately turned their own lights on. My mom, however, was horrified. "Don't DO that! Don't you know what that means?!"   Uh... it means they didn't notice their lights were off?  
I heard about this too and have never once actually encountered this. Also if your blowjob skills are so weak you can see the other girls lipsticks then what are you even doing. And also gross. This feels like one of those dateline tonight episodes our  moms all watched before demanding to know if we were involved when we got home from school.  
Definitely thought it was supposed to be an analogy. "Spread like a syringe in a ball pit." 
I guess you remember the particularly bad ones. That's probably normal. 
I have the opposite. I've never heard anyone complain about it, but I've definitely seen people post it and thought "fuck off" to myself. 
I've always believed this until a cashier had a 10 minute conversation with me about a certain item I was buying. I'd orginally gone to self checkout because I didn't want human interaction but she insisted I come to her line and asked me all sorts of personal questions. Idk maybe she was bored. It was 10 at night. I didn't want to be rude so I gave some vague answers to her questions but yeah. I don't expect it to happen again but apparently it does.  
Some Jewish people I know like to get Christmas trees and jokingly call them 'Hanukkah bushes'. Everyone's pretty chill with Christmas. 
Not religious at all. Love wishing people a merry Christmas. 'Tis the reason for the season.  
I think SJWs are something that people like to be mad at, so the people complaining about them are usually the ones who look for them. 
I remember my good friend's dad believed this whole-heartedly about Obama. He once said, "That sumbitch came out and said on live tv that he wouldn't give up his power after his second term!" When I asked him to show me where Obama said it he just acted like it was erased from the internet to prevent an assassination attempt. 
It totally is a felony. But there's also people who actively seek it, it's called "bug chasing" and it's pretty scary.  
We have lots of social welfare here in Australia, and it's pretty common for this to happen. If you earn a bit more you lose your Health Care Card (cheap public transport, cheap medicine), you lose your rental assistance and your family tax benefit is reduced, then you lose exemption to the Medicare Tax contribution.  It's usually worth it to work, but if you're right on the border then it can be better to work a little less.  
Taco Bell was my absolute favorite fast food place as a kid and I never had a problem. As an adult I hardly ever go there, maybe like once every couple years, but I still have never gotten sick from it.  It's probably from overeating. That'll give you the loose poops from *any* restaurant food. 
I was told to have a "Blessed day" at Michaels the other day. Obviously, public Christianity isn't a problem. 
I had one incident, where several people including me(f) entered a hall. Some guy held the door open and a man who was walking in front of me thanked him kindly. "Hodor" said "I'm not holding it for you, I'm holding it for HER!" while pointing at me. I deliberately ignored him for that.  There are people who even make holding a door open seem a dick move. 
The largest spoon collection is reportedly the Bertha Schaefer Koempel Spoon Collection in Paterson New Jersey, USA. It contains over 5,400 individual spoons, and I think it is safe to assume under 10,000.   This probably isn't counting cutlery manufacturers and people who have really large numbers of disposable plastic spoons for various reasons. 
Can confirm. Briefly saw a gay couple once, married a horse that same day. 
My cousin lives waaay out in the sticks. I mean, they have a use for the phrase "the main dirt road" because they live on a dirt road that is off of another dirt road. It makes the front page of their weekly newspaper when the grocery store has a new manager. Every second or third post on facebook (by some miracle they have decent internet service) is some macho bullshit about being ready for ISIS. A lot of stuff about Muslims too, even though I'd be a little surprised if any Muslims lived within 20 miles of him, or if he'd ever met one. 
The closest I've ever gotten to it is seeing someone I knew who LOOKED like a welfare queen...she was on WIC, so food stamps for people with infants, and had a cell phone, (knockoff) designer purse, nails done, and obviously dyed hair. But her parents still paid for her cell phone (she was married at this point), the bag was less than $20, and she did her own hair and nails (she worked at a salon). But anyone who just glanced at her likely would have thought that she was gaming the system.  
So you're the reason everyone has to watch those safety videos. 
Went to a timeshare presentation in Mexico. The guy hit us up leaving the airport. As this was not our first time, we entered the room with the lady who was pitching, and told her "in all honesty, we will listen to your pitch, but we are not buying anything. We are only here for the free stuff."  She was PISSED. Told us we were wasting people's time, and gave us the vouchers and told us to leave. But not before I chewed her ass about blindsiding people who had just got off a plane and were looking forward to a vacation.  Totally worth it, and didn't have to even listen to the hour long pitch. 
Still use hydrogen peroxide based cleaner for my soft contacts. Every now and then it gets me. Terrible feeling. Need to get contacts out because they are burning your eyes so bad. Eyes are burning so bad you can't open them to get the contacts out. Super sucks. 
What was the experience like while eating them? You say "peaches" so you infer you are more than just one? Why did your grandmother keep these peaches for 45 years?  There's so many details you're keeping from us. 
God this reminds me of a cringy story from my elementary school years.   Bigger kid in class got cast as Santa Claus in a school play.  I walk to Biggest girl in class room and asks if she tried out for Mrs. Santa Claus.  She asks, "Why?"  Immediately say, "Cuz you're fat..."  As the words left my mouth, so did my lunch, cuz she punched my square in the balls, which I rightfully deserved.  I'm sorry, Sandy. I was young, stupid, and didn't have a filter.  
Just reading the name *Southern Comfort* made my stomach roll. Apparently Southern Comfort and I have a history.  
 I had a similar situation, but mine was with rum. My mother would put red packets of koolaid flavoring or whatever those things are called into a gallons of water. It would turn the water into koolaid or rather that's what it's for. She would keep the gallon of koolaid next to an empty gallon of water which she filled with rum.   Anyways i poured it in a cup and took a gulp of "koolaid" followed by "EWW MOM THIS TASTES LIKE MEDICINE! Wasn't pleasant... 
Lent $1k to a co-worker once. Took almost 6 months to get it back, meanwhile she is posting pics of her out on the town and doing expensive activities while claiming she "doesn't have it yet". Haven't spoken to her since.  
honestly, it's a wild ride but not a bad one. felt like my bits were being gently warmed in the hands of a lover and at the same time like i was teabagging a stream full of glacial meltwater.   kinda exhilirating.

You need to be careful with that, with some medicines that are designed to be time released, that is a good way to overdose.    
I rented a beach cabin with 7 other people. 3 of them were content with just sitting on the beach, the rest of us got antsy and wanted to do things like play mini golf and visit a few breweries. The 3 beach bums were highly incensed that we wanted to split off. They didn't get that we're all adults and not everybody has to always be doing the same thing all the time. 
Maybe it would have been a good idea to explore the rest of Wendy's menu instead of going on an all-Baconator diet.  
Crawling trough a tight hole where you don't have any opportunity to turn around and crawl back? Imagine your flash light breaking down as well.   Big nope for me.  
"Never again!" after the next time after this one.   Promise.  
I did the crumb hunt when I tried it too.. once I realized what I was doing I just sat there and cried. Never again. 
When you say icing, I'm pretty sure you ment holding ice to your eyes, but I pictured the sugar paste kind. 
Christ we ate so much venison growing up, I once caught my dad rubbing his head on the bannister.  
My father said this after we were in China and he ate a Korean sasuage from a street vendor, about 10 hours later he broke lose the biggest fart I've heard on the streets. I could see in his face that something was wrong, very wrong and he just said to my mom; we have to get to the hotel now."  Now we jokingly say "never trust a fart"

I can't speak for all of pregnancy, but first trimester is absolutely horrible.   Can't tell if you're hungry or full, throw up multiple times in a day, hate literally all food....  Luckily, we picked the 2 for 1 deal, so after this pregnancy we'll have two kids and be done. 
I was only 4 years old when I tripped on an escalator and it really tore open my knee. Lots of blood running down my leg and everything.   I'll be 28 next week and while I have moved past the avoiding escalators altogether, I still get a little nervous and often need a moment to make sure I'm timing my step properly, and I have to have a hand free to hold the rail or it's not happening. 
Coming from a pack a day smoker I genuinely wish I could say "never again".  
The Blazin sauce used to be different. Now it is made with ghost peppers (allegedly) and not what they used to use.

One or both parties always end up catching feelings. I thought it was bad being the one that had no interest, and now I'm on the other side and I want to die.

Do they hate each other cause they fucked in the beginning and dad married her sister or what? 
My wife's identical twin sister is the best sister ever and she has no one else in the town of a tangerine.   Swear to god real iPhone suggestions 
She uh... brought her twin to your date? She kind of started the awkward train if you ask me.  
I like the different colors thing. Who wears the original? 
Do you ever think your brother started dating her twin because he thought your girl was a hottie 
That's crazy. That is literally the last thing I would ever think to ask the sister of the girl I was dating.  
Well said...I'm not gonna lie, my girlfriend's sister is *fucking* attractive. I HATE feeling this way, but her personality does not mesh with mine like it does with my girlfriend. 
My SO's dad has an identical twin who lives in another state with his family. Every once in a while his mom gets calls from concerned friends who don't know that he's a twin.  "I just want you to know I saw your husband with another family"  "Oh no that's his twin brother" 
I dated a girl who had an identical twin. My girlfriend was studying in the US, but her family lived in South America. We went to visit her family, and I met her twin, and her twins fiancee for the first time at a family party.   I few beers later, I came up behind 'my girlfriend' and started rubbing her shoulders...it was not my girlfriend, it was her twin. Her fiancee was watching me the entire time and was just giggling. Luckily he thought it was funny.  
This chick has clearly never seen a bowl of ice cream. There's literally nothing stopping me dishing up two and spooning both of them.  Could you tell them apart from which one was bad at analogies?  
I can explain this. I can't always tell which person I am in the photo when I am younger.  Usually, I have to look at which one is my twin and then realize: she's that one, so this one is me.   I think it is because I saw her 10000 a day when we were kids, but I only saw myself in the mirror when I was brushing my teeth.  So in my mind, I am looking for my mirror image.  Also, we shared clothes so that doesn't help unless I can see our watches or necklaces that we used to help our parents and teachers know who we were.  And sometimes shoes, I guess. 
Makes me wish that at some point in the future I could go to some fancy cloning clinic with a hair follicle, and be like "hey can you duplicate this but make it gayer this time around?  I guess that raises weird age issues though, even if they came out looking 30 
A close neighborhood friend of mine had twin sisters growing up. He was a year older than me, them a year younger. The whole crew paid very little attention to them until high school rolls around. They blossomed like a lotus flower.   I always knew they were off limits, but one time hanging in his basement another (drinking problem) friend started blabbering about how he was going to get with them and my other friend (who I think was also drunk, but not as much so) freaked out, punched a hole in the wall and dared him to say that again. He did, and promptly received a couple hooks to the face.  
The situation with the brother's girlfriend sounds interesting. Can you come up with any examples? 
Definitely misread that as "my girlfriend had long dark hair and dressed like a nipple" 
Holy shit I haven't thought about that anime in a while... 
I've never thought about why, but you're right, I have two brothers and have always been a bit standoffish with their wives, and I think you hit the nail on the head with your 'why'. 
Lots of carefully thought out answers in this thread.  But here's the truth. 
Nothing awakens me more than calling my girlfriend's mom "babe"  
If I'm honest,  I figured Jimmy Carr would have a cleverer user name.  
A long time ago the company I worked for had a similar situation. We had contracted a guy to do some programming for us and he wasn't delivering what he promised. Looking for prior experiences others may have had with him we Googled his freelancing email, which promptly returned the many forum posts he had made on creepshot/voyeur forums. 
On the bright side, if you decide to find a third, you know where to look 
Well when you're sleeping next to someone who feels like they care about you more than your wife, it's kind of understandable. Never been married, never had an escort, but feeling alone when your with the person who is supposed to love you sucks.    Have thought about hiring an escort just to hang out with lol. I'm sad.  
asking for a friend, what's the average amount of tips do dancers usually get from one client? 
She didn't know him at all apparently. That's so sad. 
For a while I was expecting the ending to be that the wife ended up paying your friend for services too.    
These people's SOs do realize that it's usually the client who initiates contact, right? So telling the escort not to contact the client again is just stupid. 
That's a genius cover actually. Offering the free trip made you out to be a telemarketer which would make sense to have on your phone.  
so, sir, we have your underage daughter on drug charges here...oh and um prostitution. 
Any time you ask Reddit a question you'll usually just a thousand "I'm not what you asked for but..." replies. If OP was smart he'd have tried reverse psychology. 
Thats so epic, imagine seeing some girl trying to put her clothes on scrambling out of a house with a gun and throwing it in a random dumpster before running off lmao  me irl 
so interesting.  a girlfriend from my past was super jealous of a close female friend i had and she said she'd rather i fuck some random babe than have an emotional affair with this friend.  
Well yeah you're not gonna hear from him if you block his number 
"So what does that make me?"      "Absolutely nothing." 
The lesson here is to never escort without your robe and wizard hat. 
That's fucked. So that shit is still happening? If your friend couldn't get the cops or cps to do anything maybe you can. It's really fucked up to hear that someone is hurting a child but no one is doing anything about it. Go be a hero, please.  
Baby-dump is also a shop. They even sponsored a cycling team and it was called Team Baby-Dump. At least if the sales go down, they can start an abortion clinic and keep the signs they already have. 
Went there for my one 13th/14th birthday or something. Despite the shit name that place was *way* better than Chuck E Cheese. Go Karts, peddle boats with water cannons on them, batting cages and a really dope arcade. I remember going on the boats with a pocket full of tickets from the arcade that, instead of using a counting machine, the prize lady weighed. I got hella extra tickets. I do remember that place getting shut down or sold due to a sex offender scandal of some sort. Not sure as I don't live in the area any more. 
"Hello, Allen, Allen, Allen and Allen"  "May I speak to Allen please?"  "Sorry, he's with a very important client and wont be available until tomorrow."  "Then I'll talk to Allen."  "Nope, he's in court for the day, and will be for the next week"  "Is Allen available then?"  "He's on vacation for another two weeks?"  "Okay, then can I please speak to Allen?"  "Speaking..." 
I once had two friends who both went by "other Josh". 
That actually doesn't seem weird to me.  Video rental has become a rural business because many of those areas still have limited streaming ability.  Chainsaw repair is also a rural business.  And because rural areas have fewer customers, it makes sense that they would not be able to support themselves with just one customer base.  There's a video rental place I pass by sometimes that is in the middle of the woods (still on a main road, though), and they do other things as well.  Hunting gear, fishing bait, etc... 
That laughing accident would have brought him more business. He's a genius 
I mentioned it lower down but there is a Pho King in Phoenix.  
Out in the prairies of Canada there are Rape fields as far as the eye can see.   Rape is the proper name of the plant Canola oil comes from. 
Yeah having associations with a pedophile kind of seems like a good reason to rebrand... 
Unicum is a really good name, it just sucks that it has 'cum' in it now.  The word means 'a unique example or specimen.'  That would be dope to have a design company named that. 
Dont forget about Pump 'n Munch, another Iowa gas station chain. 
I know someone whose name is Bich N'ga. So glad she pronounced it for me when I met her. 
"My name is Feedler... I'm gonna be *on the roof...* FEEDLER ROOFING COMPANY!!!" 
Boring, he should have gone with "Vegetas", "Beer Gun Festival", "Furtive Gals", "Vibrant Eel Fudge", "A Vengeful Birds Teat", or "Federal Vintage Tubs" 
There's a place in town called Kuts Klips & Kurls. Like, I get what they were going for with the same letter repeated, but ALL OF THOSE WORDS ALREADY START WITH "C".  
The A is so the company is at the top of an alphabetical list 
There's one around here that has a bright yellow honey wagon called the "stool bus". 
I guess I'm the only one who thought "Jew will restore"... 
I'm not far from there and my wife wants sushi on our date tonight.  I know where I am going now.  And she thinks Reddit is a waste of time! 
We actually have a site called publin.ie that documents pubs in Dublin. 
We have one nearby called "Shear Today, Gone Tomorrow" 
In Dublin currently, just saw knobs and hookers which is a bit of a white elephant shop, gets attention so I guess it's a good name 
I ate at a chain called Dicks Last Resort once. It is basically a Joes Crab Shack but the waiters are super rude as a gimmick. Pretty fun place, definitely gotta go in with a good attitude.  
There is a "Rustic Razor" barbershop near mine. Makes me wonder if the clientele needs regular Tetanus shots. 
I saw a liquor store called Discount Liquor but the sign was broken so it said Disco Liquor. That was a better name 
Actually, They get new amazing deals on the shelves every Tuesday morning. Not sure if they do that now, but that's why they named it that.  
I love my nachos with just the chips and cheese microwaved then add the salsa on top so it's still cold 
You should start a new weight loss trend "The Broke Diet". 
Why don't you just get a bag of corn chips instead of crackers? Slightly less crappy nachos. 
Wait is the coffee cup used to keep most of the explosion contained?  
Without a glass of milk that meal is like a slow death sentence.  
The problem is the people with the laziest food suggestions are too lazy to comment. The world may never know true Lazy Cuisine. 
Dude,  you forgot some coffee and a Hot Pocket in your microwave at home. 
You and my 4 year-old daughter share this belief. She wouldn't even consider regular chicken nuggets until I told her they were dinosaur eggs. 
Yeah, and when you're not home, always keep a pocket dog handy. 
In Norway, this is generally the way to go, except we use potato tortillas. 
I also eat peanut butter straight from the jar. My husband thinks it's weird but it's delicious and filling. No need for bread, just two or three spoonfuls of PB will get you through the day. 
Idk man, i don't consider dodging 5 flights of stairs lazier than cereal 
Get the multicolored pasta from Target. Makes you feel 10x fancier 
You can save a lot of time by softening the potatoes in the microwave while the oven warms up  
That sounds amazing, and "Stuff" is the perfect name for it. 
Our definitions of lazy differ by approximately  0.6 Garfields.  
So easy and so delicious. A little bit of HP, Chili Powder and Cayenne Pepper if you want to get creative. 
Add a couple cans of tuna and extra shredded cheese. It is amazing. 
Try some lentils and shit like that bro. Ramen is sometimes food. 
That used to be my meal for when I wanted to impress myself. 
Fuck yes Spaghetti Aglio e Olio! Easy to learn, but difficult to master and get the balance of flavours just right. Spent months trying to consistently cook a balanced dish.  
People definitely overestimate how hard steak is to cook. No need to dirty anything but one pan, takes less than 5 minutes to cook, add a pad of butter if you are feeling daring.  
For some reason I pictured you covering this with milk and nearly gagged. I guess it's time to go to bed.  
Why are you dirtying an extra bowl when you have a perfectly good measuring cup to eat out of 
As delicious as this sounds, that's a lot of work when most of us are thinking mac n' cheese or rice with butter. Chopped cilantro for fucks sake do I look like Gordan Ramsey??  Just putting in the effort to add the apostrophe after the n has me thinking about calling off work  
I once dipped uncooked tortellini in dressing and ate that for dinner. It takes 5 mins to cook the tortellini but that was just too difficult.  
In 1991, I had what was referred to as a Prince Valiant. I was in sixth grade. It was my choice and my parents let me do it. I never want to do that again. 
There it is. Those damn Hawaiian shirts and frosted tips haha. I was a rural Midwest kid looking like fucking Guy Fieri for picture day.  
Dude. I was a poor kid in an affluent school. The cool kids did it right. They wore baseball jerseys and loose jeans backwards. I wore kind of tight jeans and a collared dress shirt backwards once. Never again. Stayed in my lane from then on.  
Me too, looked great with my JNCOs, chain wallet, and black doc Martins. 
Ah yes, so we're the same age. Gotta have the frosted tips and that flip-up in the front, too. 
The mother of one of my friends when I was a kid got one of those.  She only wore it once to my knowledge.  Mostly because when she put it on it ended up with two brightly colored circles over her boobs.  Awkward. 
Minus the mullet, I think this phase is coming back, but in a more modern version.  
90's? We did this with men's briefs. Jeans falling off our hips and Calvin Klein briefs sticking out, tight belly shirt and pierced belly button. The fashion was stupid but I had nice abs back then so no regrets. 
I wanted to be a cool scene/emo kid at school and I couldn't afford all the stuff other girls had, too! I had the sweeping hair and cheap, shitty eyeliner layered on thick... and the most embarrassing part is that I took a selfie at school like that. Black and white, I was looking down, etc. and I'll admit that it wasn't a bad picture as far as teen selfies go, but my mother insisted that it was just such a pretty picture of me that she put it on her computer, enlarged it, printed it and put it in a frame. It's hanging up in our kitchen ten years later. 
Differing shoes sounds cute!  I wore the same black Converse through my entire school life, but I put mismatching laces in them... at the height of my emo phase, I had a Green Day lace in one and a My Chemical Romance one later. By the time I got bored of changing them, one foot had a sparkly pink lace and the other was rainbow leopard print. I thought I was so cool. 
The problem with goggles and quirky shit like that is you have no justification for wearing it. I want to wear goggles like Naruto all the time but I don't weld that often or have sandstorms that justify it. It is cool for the people that actually make it functional.  
Fuck I forgot about rat tails. Those were always hilarious to me. I remember I had a fake clip on one though to look like anakin skywalker when I had stick fights with my friends 
Yes, my sister and I use to think it was so cute after we saw a character from a show wearing it. We also wore pants with skirts. All of the other kids thought we rocked in the fashion department.  
I don't know when you did it but that was definitely a late 80's-early 90's trend. 
My dad and his buddies were so mad about the feather trend because it inflated the prices of fly tying (for fishing) supplies. 
My mom would patch mine with iron on butterflies and flowers! I thought I had the nicest pants out of all the elementary school girls. 
My sister went through a major industrial goth phase that's still wearing off a decade later. She got very into adding chains to pants for a while - but on budget.  Many dollar store dog leashes and chains were butchered for her look. She even went so far as to go to a hardware store and buy about 36 inches of industrial, welded chain.   Each link was about about 2.5 inches long by 1.25 inch (62mm x 38mm). Not sure what gauge,  but it was some fat chain.  The thing must have weighed a couple pounds (1kg+), not sure how her pants stayed up.  Good thing she was always wearing like three belts, only two of them weren't doing any work. 
I bought a pair of cat ears designed like Marie from The Aristocats at Disneyland and wore them to school every day for a whole year. Funny thing was, I'd never even seen The Aristocats, I just really loved cats! 
Long hair will never die! It's usually just that people get day jobs that they can't look like a heavy metal dirtbag at. 
by keychain do you mean lanyard? if so then I still do it. 
Townies. We used to shout mosh mosh get a wash. Then a year later I became a full blown mini mosher. Ah tribal instincts. I used to spend ages making sure just the tip of my shoe lace poked out of the hole, and never dreamed of tying my shoes.   
And you had to wear a couple of pairs of contrasting socks to tuck the roll into with your LaGears with 3 different laces braided on the ends. 
Most of my summer wear consists of cargo shorts and band tees. I don't even care.  
Bodysuits are back and man do I appreciate them now. I hate when my undershirts get untucked from my pants. 
The supreme dick move is to leave the cart in the middle of the space *right next to* the cart return. 
Honestly, I don't like public proposals period. And they're awkward as fuck if both people aren't on the same page and someone gets denied in front of everyone (I'm of the opinion you shouldn't really propose unless you guys have had a full, clear conversation about marriage in private already). 
I know a guy who noticed a new town was starting to grow and purchased two pharmacy licenses for the area (I think it's a 30km exclusion  radius or something).   The rule is that as many licenses can be issued as needed, but the oldest license has preference for trading for the first 25000 residents.   So by buying two, he essentially monopolised the town until the population exceeded 50,000.   He never opened a pharmacy, and sold the first license for $5m and the second for $3m.  
the bag seat is fine as long as other seats are available  not having headphones and listening to your music means we should be able to cut your fucking head off, for all to witness, as a warning to any other motherfucker who thinks that shit is ok 
Sometimes, things splash a bit. Sometimes, fluid pressure gets a bit outta hand. Aint none of us too good to grab a square or two of toilet paper and wipe up after we're done. 
My neighbors do this EVERY DAY and leave the street in front of their house open. Shit pisses me off so much.  
My mom was nine months pregnant with me when it happened to her. She saw who it was, tracked him down in Costco and verbally lambasted him in front of a crowd of onlookers.   People were like what the fuck is going on here? And my mom is just laying into him meanwhile my dad has fucked off somewhere trying to get the shopping done.   But yeah, total dick move.  
Fucking over your literal bro is the most severe violation of the bro code there is, surpassed only by fucking over a twin or litter-mate, with whom you shared a womb not only spatially but temporally. 
Some theaters used to have baby rooms. It's a sound proof room at the back of the theater where you can still watch the movie and hear through speakers, but your screaming potato won't bother anyone.  
Hell, not just minimum wage positions, but any jobs where you have to interact with the public as part of work. My wife has a biology degree and works at a museum taking care of animals (which, yes, involves lots of cleaning their enclosures). People see her cleaning stuff and just sort of assume she's uneducated and treat her like shit. She said one time she was cleaning something and this kid asked their mom what she was doing. The mom said something to the effect of, she's doing what you'll have to do if you don't go to college.  How she didn't snap that woman's neck is a something I will never know. 
Gotta love Cataan. There was one time I asked if someone had sheep to trade, they said "what for?" then played the monopoly card. They were unhappy 
Wtf that's more than just a dick move, it's pure psychotic..  
In the same vein, spitting your gum out on the sidewalk/pavement so someone else steps in it 
Also not putting weights back in the right place. If I have to remove two 10s, a 35, and a random clip just to get that last 45, someone is a douche. 5s go with 5s, 10s go with 10s, 25s with 25s, and so on.  
Yeah.  Goddamn as a child of divorce (one that wasn't that bad all things considered) this should be illegal. 
Yes. I know someone who had a golden retriever with a tumor in its mouth. It got so bad the dog couldn't eat on it's own or even drink water. Maggots we're starting to collect around the tumor because the flesh was starting to rot. The poor pup was constantly bleeding as well. The owners knew for months the dog was suffering but wouldn't put her down because they couldn't emotionally handle it. Bitch, you're dog can't physically handle it.  
I had this happen not too long ago.  My mom and I were the only people at an afternoon movie.  This woman came in with two toddlers and plopped them down next to us.  Then they proceeded to talk through the ENTIRE movie. 
Someone at my school is currently compiling a 20+ page peer review of a group project partner because his partner did nothing, 10 of those pages are references for texts and emails that they had in which they talked about agreeing to do something then not following through. The project was for chemical engineering and over 50% of the final grade and the dude is creating this review during pre-finals weekend, I don't think I've met someone who has ever been this pissed at a partner  
I watched a dude drive onto the dividers in between the roads to pass people stuck at a red light  Fucking Cuntwaffle 
I once got rear ended by a guy who was tailgating me. The car in front of me stopped suddenly to make a turn, so of course I had to stop suddenly also. He didn't get a ticket or anything but his insurance put him at fault for "failure to maintain a safe distance".  
Please remember riding shotgun is a responsibility, not a privilege. You are the co pilot. 
Seriously, the bin is right by the door. It's not like you have to go out of your way to toss your overpriced half-eaten popcorn tub. 
Took me 42 years and some really crap partner's to find the right one, heads up, it will happen.  Little while from now you'll realise it was her loss. 
At the Whole Foods in my town, they have a bunch of parking spots reserved for "carpools." Sure, it's a great way to save carbon emissions, but who the fuck carpools to go grocery shopping? Those spots are always empty. 
Or when they try to start a conversation while you're both pissing. 
Oh it isn't silent. That kitchen staff is pissed especially if it was a busy night.  
In the immortal words of that one sign at Jimmy John's, "a person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter is not a nice person." 
Seriously. My epipen, even with coupons, is still 600 bucks.  
it allows people to claim that they own a "small business" for very little money and effort. it's very popular with soccer moms who have nothing to do but want to feel useful 
I honestly don't understand why it's so hard for parents to control their children. I just took my kids to a local secondhand bookstore. We went into their housewares room, with lots of breakables scattered around for sale. I tell my four year old, "hands to yourself, okay?" "Okay mom."  Two seconds later another mom walks in with her three kids, and the oldest two, maybe 7 & 5, start *ransacking* shit. They knocked over these decoration African masks, split one in half, the other knocked over a coffee cup, shattered that. And what does this mom do? She grabs them and turns around and walks out the door. My 4 year old turned to me and said, "Well, they don't know how to keep their hands to themselves, huh mommy?" "You're absolutely right son, sometimes people just don't care about anything but themselves."   
This last election, South Dakota voted to regulate these types of loans. When the owner of one of the largest pay day loan companies in the state heard about the bill he lobbied to put another bill on the ballot allowing these companies to continue charging the same rates as long as they signed an agreement like they already did.  We voted to regulate rates and voted against allowing contracts to continue using absurd rates. Very shortly after the results were in, the owner of the pay day companies announced he would be closing every business he had in the state, putting hundreds of people out of work. He even closed the doors to his music academy that provided free music lessons to less fortunate children. 
Turning the conversation into how shitty it is when people record someone without their knowledge would have been fun.  
Nope. That's against the law. You can be fined a minimum of like $125. 
Nah man, you use reddit. Obviously you're an unemployed, sheltered no life whos life IS the computer. You didnt go OUT for lunch. 
On airlines like Air New Zealand, they don't let you do this. I've had flight attendants wake me up to tell me I have to put my seat up because it's meal time. 
That is illegal and you can be ticketed for that.  
Nope, that is legitimate strategy. I will never accept that its a dick move. It is a valid game theory option that is very much part of the game rule set. 
Also touching a pregnant woman's belly without permission. You wouldn't reach out and touch someone's stomach uninvited normally, what's the difference now? If anything, it's more rude. 
I hope that your teacher is okay now! I recently lost one of my favorite teachers in high school (coincidentally also a history teacher) to suicide. He was beloved by all of his students, he was the baseball coach too and he was the only teacher I would get up early and got to practice for. I didn't know of his struggles although I did know he always advocated for men's mental health. I miss him and I tear up now when I find report cards and homework from his classes.   I hope your teacher got the help he needed.  
My best friend lost her dad to cancer when she was 12 and her mom taught her to use humour to cope. She likes to tell people he died and then ask them if they want to see a picture of her and her dad, and then she shows them a picture of her smiling next to his tombstone.    Her mom died in February   They cremated her, put her in a wine bottle, and threw her at the las Vegas sign We make jokes about how nuts she was lmao 
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Who would do that? What did you do? What did your mum say? 
I have a friend with bilateral cochlear implants. That is, he was born deaf and still has less than average hearing with the implants.  Well, back in high school, he was in several of my classes. Stand up guy, really nice, yadda yadda. Anyway, one day, one of our teachers asks him some banal question. Here's a transcript of the following interaction:  Friend: ...What?  Teacher: *repeats question*  Friend: Sorry... what?  Teacher: *jokingly* What, are you deaf or something?  Friend: ...uh, yes?  Teacher looks horrified, entire class and friend start dying laughing. Teacher apologizes profusely. Luckily, she was actually a super nice lady and basically forgot my friend was, in fact, deaf without his implants.  
uhhh.. how did you know that the joke was *going* to be about her breath? 
I had something kinda similar happen. I moved from Ohio to Iowa during middle school. One day I was wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes shirt. One of my teachers grabbed me and dragged me to principal's office. When I asked what was going on she told me I knew exactly what I did. I had no idea what she was talking about.  At the principal's office she finally explained how I was wearing a marijuana t-shirt. The reason being that the Buckeyes logo is sometimes just a Buckeye leaf with or without a nut. After I quickly explained my teacher called me a liar. Then the principal just kind of sighed and told me I could go back to class and the teacher needed to stay behind. He clearly knew I was in the right.  I got a half-hearted apology from her later. 
Fuck her. My school nurse sophomore year of high school thought I was faking illness to get out of gym class, my favorite class.  Turns out I had undiagnosed Crohn's that got worse and worse through the year until I could barely walk without exhaustion.  
In the same vein, I had a high school teacher that nicknamed everyone; his name for my friend from Syria was "Green card". 
She's not *that* Mexican, Mom, she's *my* Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. 
Well to be fair that is probably true for all of us. 
Lunch ladies, in my experience, are either some of the nicest/most caring women you will ever meet or just straight up old bitching hags.  
Coming from a garbage man himself, fuck that teacher. My dad opened up his own sanitation company and he's way smarter than most people I've met. Garbage men's brains are like a freaking GPS too it's crazy.  
My teacher said the same thing to me! I was around 11 years old and she told me that I'd never achieve anything in life and that I'd be a screw up forever.  This was because I did an assignment with a friend of mine instead of doing it alone. Fuck me for having a friend right? 
The worst my shop teacher ever said was we were welcome to huff the glue or paint. He described what it does and how easy it is to die from it, but said it wasn't his place to stop natural selection 
tbh I can understand the teacher. I was in pretty much the same situation. One year our class was so bad, the teacher left after that year to a school in the next city.  
My sixth form tutor told us the same thing. He used to work as a councilor for recovering drug addicts and had had patients commit suicide. Now that I think about, I do hope he didn't give his patients this advice. 
Had a girl at my school get in huge trouble for her dress one day. It didn't break the dress code on her, and another girl was wearing the exact same dress and it *did* break it for her. The girl in trouble asked why she was the one being disciplined...  "Because *she* looks good in it." 
Please tell me his replacement was called Titsman.  
One time we were drawing this part of a photo we saw in art class with a pencil and paper, and my friend wasn't very good at drawing so the art teacher took it from him, and yelled something along the lines of it being a really bloody bad drawing, and ripped/crumpled it up in front of him and the whole class. This was in Grade 5 or 6, and of course, my friend was balling his eyes out.  
am i a bad person for slightly laughing at that? Yes, Yes i am. 
Was this the same teacher who regularly said "I didn't get off the slave ship yesterday?" 
That's terrible. And not at all what a teacher should do.  I was taking lessons to be a teacher and one of the first things we learn is if we find a student like this then we should find a way to get them caught up. Not to punish them.  
I taught for a while and there were times I was dangerously close to doing something similar.  
The girls couldn't get out temporarily to be fixed? Like that was their better solution? 
So, by that logic, a women isn't raped if she gets wet and/or has an orgasm? 
Ah yes all those white people in Palatine and Egypt truly god's chosen ones /s Edit guys I I get it Mary was from Nazareth  
I laughed my ass off. He sounds like a fun teacher. 
I guess they are dropping out because he is racist. 
As a teacher, this crap infuriates me. If a kid proves me wrong, I openly admit it and give them kudos for doing it. Throwing a kid out because they stood up for what they know is right because you're too insecure to let a teenager prove you wrong is the kind of thing that makes kids hate school. 
I remember when in the last years of high school I was the only male in the class and teachers would jokingly refer to us as "girls and boy" 
I had a teacher tell my mom I should see a psychiatrist and be diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and sent to an alternative school because I was sad and couldn't focus in class because my grandma just died. First time I ever heard my mom curse out anyone.   
Did you see her through her husband while you are/were working with him? If you did, what did you do or how did she react? 
Teacher here.  We take up cell phones during testing.  I told the students that if they don't finish on time, I'd sell the phones on ebay cause "daddy needs a new pair of shoes."   Smart Ass Student: But Mr. Santoriin you don't have any kids...   Me: Just cause I don't have kids doesn't mean no one calls me daddy.   it may have disrupted the testing environment.  
Alright, I know that's horrible, but it is kinda funny  
Do you need direction on every little thing, Timmy? Color it. Don't color it. DO YOU REALLY THINK I CARE? 
It sucks but he probably said it because he had a bleak outlook due to him having a front row seat to his mother's experiences. Still shouldn't have been said though. 
Damn that's messed up. Its good that you had the courage to say something though.  
Whoa... that's sooo illegall where I live to influence students politically 
Similarly, I had a World Religion teacher explain that "science and religion are coming closer and closer together. There's even a group of people who celebrate this called Scientologists and they...." She's the teacher responsible for our education on different religions and she can't get Scientology even remotely right.   I genuinely wish I was making this up.  
Is GDR just English for Deutsche Demokratische Republik? 
Great, now all I can think about is who conceived the most poetic hell. 
"I have good parents who raised me not to be an asshole." 
What the actual heck? Why would a human being do that ? 
In Geometry we had a girl was a cheerleader who used to wear short skirts and sit in the front row of class.  She was super annoying, as she never "got" any of the math problems on the board, and was always asking questions, etc.   The teacher hated her so much, everyone knew it including the cheerleader.   Well she used to sit there as he was teaching and spread her legs wide open with no panties on.  He sent her to the office a couple times, but she'd come back with a note from the principal saying "she was exempt from the dress code regulations regarding skirt length, as it was part of her cheerleading uniform"   Eventually, he started talking to the pencil sharpener  (seriously)  saying stuff like "32 years, I've been here 32 years, just 3 more to go"  or "can you believe it, can you believe how they treat me, I am a human being, a human being I tell you".  
Even restaurants have that advertised in the front of their buildings. 
You should be careful with bottled water you leave in the car. I don't know if it's true, but I think there was a study that claimed drinking bottled water left in card for an amount of time increases the risk of breast cancer. 
You don't really use water for cookies, unless they were scared of how she washed her hands. 
If you aren't going to trust the test what was the point of having it done? 
Sure, but the repairs are already under way and no amount of suing anyone is going to make it faster or less expensive.  
They just dont give a shit. Poor black people really dont have a voice over there. And the people privileged enough to have the power to potentially fix it are so lost in yankee jingoism they refuse to accept there is a serious problem.  
Im pretty sure most city water pipes are made of lead. Which isnt a problem, usually.  Flint is having trouble because of the other chemicals in the water that have corroded the pipes.  Im no chemist, but i know my city has lead pipes and the waters good.  
Don't forget all the fertilizer and petroleum waste runoff. But basically, nobody gives a shit. Waste has always been dealt with this way, and nothing has changed to accommodate the vastly larger population and strain on the local ecosystem.  
The Michigan AG is a worthless fuck. He is announcing new charges in the morning but it's political maneuvering to coincide with his gubernatorial run.  
It costs a lot of money to be in perpetual war with eight different countries. 
I wish the mods would just make a rule that all threads be serious. Damn near every thread without it turns into a shit show.  
Livonia resident here. The advisory was issued only as a precautionary measure and its pretty funny how some residents have been blowing it out of proportion on Facebook. Some people are freaking out because they drank the water, or brushed their teeth. It's just a precautionary boil water alert, no bacteria has actually been detected. They finished the first round of tests that came back clean. Now they have to wait another 24 hours to conduct the second round of tests to confirm. Just waiting for results to get the all clear.  It's been very entertaining to see the drama play out amongst the residents on local social media pages.   Our family didn't find out about the water advisory until the day after they issued it. My whole family drank a lot of water that day and we were fine. We have since switched to drinking bottled water, but have been showering and brushing our teeth with tap water.  We are all still feeling well and haven't grown a third eye.  
Boiling does not remove lead or other metals, primarily used to kill pathogens. Filters vary widely in their ability to remove lead. One needs to carefully read specs before choosing one and then test filtered water to see if claims are accurate.  
Still happening, the presidential candidates milked Flint for all the political points they could and moved on, little has happened since. 
Yep. I make zero physical contact beyond shaking hands when introducing myself. I'll hug close friends but that's it. 
My sister was really into the indigo girls and ani difranco and cut her hair off and joined the rugby team. This was about 15 years ago, and she is now happily married to a man.  We were all *shocked* 
I remember in girl with the dragon tattoo when the villian says "you'll be amazed at what people do because they don't want to be rude" and I feel like half of the crap we put up with is because we want to be nice or polite.   (This was from the movie and I paraphrased I don't remember the book very well) 
I once gave a compliment to my friend on a party. I just said his shirt looked nice on him when he thought it was too small. And then all his peers went "ooooooooooooooooooh" behind him. I just really wanted to compliment my friends and I do it all the time. :( I never gave a compliment to him ever again.  
Whenever I eat a banana in public, I aggressively tear it apart with my bared teeth 
I do this too! Except I'm a 6'4 man and in reality it's just because finding pants that are long AND skinny is very difficult, I have far too few casual belts, and I don't want to literally show off my ass. 
"Omg is that a grill gamer?" "Marry me" "Suck my dick"  Every time I start talking in an Overwatch comp... 
Also... who the fuck are you random guy? Am I supposed to just trust you with my stuff?  
What I hate more is when they tell me it's just because I've NEVER HAD A REAL MAN BEFORE. JEEZ I know confidence is sexy but your dick is not magic, it cannot un-gay me tyvm. 
Yep. Last year I ran into a coworker at the supermarket, and he offered to help me out with my groceries. We get to my car, and all of a sudden I'm arguing with him for 10 minutes about why I don't want to date him.  I started off joking, then got serious; Finally I just got in the car and left.  
For the life of me, I don't understand why people are so scandalized when a bra strap shows. It's not my fucking nipple, it's a strip of cotton with a little plastic slider.   As a kid, I never gave a fuck, and as an adult, lol I still don't care. Call me trashy if you want, I don't have time to care about that shit.  
You are engaged?   Screw you b*tch for leading me own 
Being bigger definitely reduces a lot of what I've read here. I was a nice, friendly, not skinny but not overweight girl a few years back and i couldnt look at a bloke without being harassed.   Now I'm not-so-skinny lol but the problem has done a 180, now i cant have a conversation with a bloke at a bar because they panic thinking a fat chick is hitting on them and wont give me the time of day.    Basically i stopped trying to make friends lol  
Hey I saw your post.   HI    hey   HOW are you   hey  
Not just that, but you've now given a clear green light for them to now seize every opportunity possible to talk about all the feelings they've had building up over the years that they've never shared with anyone else. You become their sole emotional support system when you were just trying to be a normal friend once.  
When I was 13, my Dad told me "nobody can think with a hard on" and "an erect dick has no conscience"   which, applied to 13 year old boys, wasn't bad advice    
I totally get why you reacted in the way you did, and have experienced similar things. The way I think of it is that my brain is automatically set to a polite setting. I know how to act like a decent human being. But when I come across a creepy guy and his behavior is so unacceptable it's like.... how do I react here? I guess I'll just keep on being polite?? My brain just defaults to that.  But nowadays I'm like.... fuck that. If a guy is being rude to me I am going to be rude right back because I don't owe him my politeness. I don't owe him anything. Most of the time these sorts of creeps are giant cowards. If you loudly confront them they'll usually back off. And if you're in a public setting, you have even more security, because strangers will make the guy back off and will be on your side if the guy has the dumbass idea to escalate. Slowly, I've retrained my reactions, and I think I'm the better for it. 
There seems to be a fairly clear pattern in those two threads: women are afraid of men, and men are afraid of scaring women. 
I always feel weird walking my dog (5lb silver/grey Chihuahua).  I will hear women/girls squee while driving by, or I get stopped a lot because of the dog.  I know full well they want to pet/interact with my dog, but that part of my biology is like, dude, they are standing right there, hit on them. I'm not trying to condone men always acting on that impulse, but it's there, and if you don't do a lot of introspection, you may not see it as wrong or that it makes people uncomfortable.  I'm usually pretty good about trying to be super neutral and just talking about the dog and not really about myself or the lady. I mean, my pupper is the fucking shit, she deserves all the attention, and I love dog people, so I don't want to creep any out. 
I literally could have written this post. I always loved having friends of both genders throughout my childhood and even some of my adolescence (it helped that I was a bit of an ugly duckling), but the older (and more attractive?) I got, the more complicated things became. I really hate having to be so cold to most men, but it's just the path of least resistance socially. :/  
Plot twist, both genders are gay when regarding bananas... 
Guys are dickheads. Was out with my gf one night. I moved away to light a smoke, and two guys came up and started hitting on her and her friend. She goes "no thanks, my bf is over there".   Next thing I know they are trying to fight *me* cause my gf told them she wasn't interested!  
Yay! I am so happy to hear not all women are terrified to be nice to men or dress however they want. I am the same way, but it took most of my 20s to get to this point...  
I assure you, there are plenty of women out there who do not have explicitly feminine interests.  
To be fair, a guy will have the same problem if they have an itch in the lower regions.  
I was friends with a girl, she'd had one boyfriend from the time she was 17 to 24 (when I met her). I could kind of tell she was a bit naive when it came to acting around male friends. I wasn't silly about it, she had a partner and I was so grateful for the support she offered me. During a super stressful time she was there to ask me how I was doing and offer support. Even just the 'Morning!' texts were such a ray of sunshine.      I can imagine stuff like that being misinterpreted as advances or whatever. But I was just happy to have a friend who cared during that time. Honestly, I did struggle with feeling for her, but I knew damn well that wasn't the appropriate course of action and it wasn't her fault either. But I valued her friendship way too much to do something so stupid like pursue her.  
I think your first male friend was off his rocker if he invited people to a house with a three week old baby to party.  The pillow thing is just weird though. 
My Uncle lives in Dingle, and I think this is the first time I've seen it mentioned outside my family. Lovely little place. 
This comment made me realize that, for some reason, it is easier to say berrydingle than dingleberry quickly.  
"Oh hey it's you! The guy with the dingleberries right?" 
Hangman was my first thought, too.  I'd probably just play it with my family though, I have elementary aged boys.  I'd be set for life very quickly. 
Hell, you could even sell your services for a fraction of any other photographer. People would be suspicious, but of course there'd be people out there that just want a cheap photographer for their wedding, so they give you a shot. With the millions you wind up making, you can get the absolute best equipment, take classes and courses to improve your techniques, and even hire professional photo editors.   Soon, you'll be one of the most wanted photographers around, and you'll just have that one quirk that people comment on (the dingleberry thing), but the end result is so good, that they just don't care. Eventually, you can have an impressive enough portfolio that even if people figure out why you have them say dingleberry (which I assume makes the money stop coming in), you could just raise your prices to reflect your new skill set. 
I can't believe I had to scroll to the bottom of this post to find the simplest and most logical answer.  
How are you going to work dingleberry into a convo?  
How about if you can't use the actual word you want them to say? 
-Acrudes massive amounts of money -Buys business -Eliminates source of income for the business and for how the massive amounts of money was made 
At least it's a better plan to scam money than faking cancer  YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Your other problem would be that you'd have millions but you'd have to hide it because you need him to call you dingleberry every so much time so you can't even quit.  
The thought of a Family Feud audience saying "dingleberry" just made me crack up in the break room.  
"It's the same guy. Sixth time this week. Look at his account too. Something's not right here." 
There's actually a YouTuber who calls his audience Dingleberries.  
I don't under and your second one. So you show them your hairy asshole with the word "dingleberry" on it, and the respond with "Oh, heavens! Dingleberry!?" 
I just tried it, it's a lot harder than you would think. 
I'd say that the chances of actually being able to spell that in Scrabble are incredibly low. But ok.  
I just realized this is what's going on. We've all been fools.  
Actually, this was my answer. I figured I'd just ask my least mature coworkers to wash my dogs, and I wouldn't do their sanitary shaves beforehand.  
This is where my main use of dingleberry comes from, also upvote for ass fluff.  
I think you'd have more luck playing subtle. They have to think you HATE that nickname, and you have to try and act like you're playing it cool, which should be easy since you make bank each time. 
I feel like you can offer way less and get the same results. 
Bonus: wear those shirts when you volunteer as a coach at a middle school.  12 year old boys will run around calling you "dingleberry" like it's the world's best joke 
Step 2: Post the word "Dingleberry" and send.   Step 3. Turn on the news.   Step 4: Profit. 
Did you vanish after the cloth wrapped around you? 
That is when you look dumbfounded and shocked at the audience ala Steve Harvey. Wait for the laughs to die down and then ask if there is anyone in the audience you can call Katie. 
Even if not magic, that's still an impressive memory  
That's when you start screaming 'WHERE'D MY HAND GO JESUS CHRIST WHAT HAVE YOU DONE" 
I did this one time.  I was talking to a buddy at a party and there was a girl behind him.  I picked up a deck of cards and fanned them out and told him to pick a card with his mind.  I asked him if it was the ace of spades.  "Nope! Haha!" and he got up and walked away.    The girl behind him just looked astonished and asked me, "How did you do that?!"  I replied magic.  Thought it was funny she didn't catch on. 
And that's why they shouldn't let drunks participate... 
Was this in Tahoe with a magician named Alex Ramon?  Exact thing happened to me at that show.  
If you're defeated by a 9 year old, you are not a good magician. 
Something similar happened to my sister, but it was with a bouncy ball and they had *her* drop it. 
Similar story, hypnotist was hired to come to our school and brought up a group of 10 of the students onto the stage. All was going well except one of the kids began to pretend he was hypnotized and being 'forced' to taking off his own pants. Remember this is a school so The hypnotist got understandably pissed and told him to get off the stage. I swear fuckin high school kids sometimes 
The pants peeing was the misdirection part of the trick, and the revealing of the buffet was the prestige. 
If that was about 25 years ago, that was me as the kid.  I was really into making balloon animals and did what you said several times.  The best part was when they were having trouble making things without popping the balloons (usually because they over inflate) so I asked if they needed help.  They thought it would be funny to watch a kid struggle, but then I made what they were trying to do.  Usually they got pretty competitive and would ask me to make something difficult, which I did.    
Man nice save. You almost lost the audience there for a second. 
"Why didn't you do it in your own purse?"  "Magic!" 
This sounds like a scene from Arrested Development with Tobias & Gob.   Tobias convinces Gob to see this new Magician in town after seeing an ad for "Tonight: Magic Mike" at some bar. The pair goes to the bar, get a table together. Tobias notes that there's pretty much only women there and Gob makes some comment about how it's pretty great.  They ask for volunteers and, of course, Gob volunteers to go up on stage. Seeing the two men seated together, the announcer doesn't ask any questions and Gob sits down, convinced that he's about to steal the show or steal a magic trick from someone only to end up getting a lap dance from a half dozen ripped, sweaty men.   Close up on Gob's face as he says "I've made a huge mistake."  
I wonder if there's legal standing on who would get charged for assault or whatever crime is committed while under hypnosis.  The person doing the act of the hypnotist? 
She probably didn't have any qualms about storing valuables in her bra. She may have easily had trouble with the idea of flashing a crowd. Flashing a crowd is not smoking or murdering, because smoking and murdering require paraphernalia and actions that are u usual throughout your life experience as a non-smoker and non-murderer. Changing clothes is common enough to get this to work. This is exactly the kind of thing hypnotism can do to a participant who ordinarily would not. 
Have to question your memory a bit on this one. The Linking Rings is classic of magic and does not use anything that could even remotely be mistaken for "clips" of any kind.   A standard set of Linking Rings consists of 8 rings: 2 single rings, a chain of 2 rings (permanently joined), a chain of 3 rings (also permanently joined) and a "key" ring which has a gap, or break in it. Fancy sets may also include a slightly oversized ring and a slightly undersized ring. There are also "locking" key rings that can let the magician open or close the gap, but no clips. Few decent magicians bother with locking keys as they're actually harder to handle.  The illusion is created by handling the rings in specific ways which let the magician initially conceal that certain rings are permanently linked and then swapping them in and out of play. Even knowing how this is done, I have seen performances that blow me away. 
say, "great.  Let's make it even more random by adding those two digits together..."  or you can say, "Deal down 11 cards... now turn over the next card." 
Your cousin doesn't sound like a very nice person... she deliberately damaged that man's property then had no regrets? Not friendly indeed... 
The trick is being well liked enough that your audience doesn't want to expose you.   I was on stage with Penn and Teller and they did an illusion where Another audience member and I tied up Teller and put him behind a curtain. He would make things that were out of his reach move and we had to check every so often to make sure he was still tied up.  At one point I was able to see that he wasn't really tied up anymore, but I still said "Yes, he is still tied up." because why would I want to spoil their show?  I also allowed Penn to tell his wife that their kids put the ice cream in the shopping cart, even though I saw him put it in there, cuz snitches get stitches. 
I made a plant cry once by implying his twin brother was the better showman, it was a petty thing to do but I was annoyed upon discovering that all the volunteers were plants when I ended up having to attend the same show a second time. 
"No, no, all I did was this"   *makes the card change*  "..."  *mother starts crying* 
Just don't volunteer to go up. If they try to pick you anyways shake your head out tell them no. 
I understand this however at the end of the day you need to think about yourself, you only have one life you don't want to destroy it. 
Jealous! I broke my ankle in Jan this year and once it healed I went on a hike for the first time in March/April I fell and cracked my ankle again about a mile away from my car about to go home. I can safely say I won't be enjoying any hikes soon :(  
Good on you! I really like that about myself too. My own personal motto is "do it *because* you're scared".  
I have an inability to stay mad at people for longer than like 24 hours.  Even if I want to be angry, usually once I wake up in the morning, I just can't be mad anymore. 
I am the exact same! I went to get my eyes tested last year with my fingers crossed I would get to buy some black think lenses geek glasses because I feel I really suit them  
And then it destroys your life but you're completely fine with it, until you aren't.  
I used to get thanked by parents when I worked at a bookstore, because I'd talk to the kid when he or she was looking for something to read instead of asking the parent what the kids wanted. Those were some of my proudest moments working there.  
Same. I can fall asleep anywhere, at any time. Thanks, Marine Corps. 
Congrats! Absolute well done I hope you are proud :) Anyone achieving their weight loss or health goals to me deserve a round of applause!  
Don't forget to be kind to yourself too. I hope you will have a nice day 
A ten inch cock would be detrimental in the bedroom. Larger than 6 inches starts to hit the cervix, which is very painful for the woman.  
Oh my god that is SO me, and I actually hate this. I always consider the bad in everything and treat it as a possibility and it just fucks my brain. Maybe I'm just an extreme case of what you've mentioned but like, assuming my family goes out to swim, I actually get so damn worried. Or if I meet someone new and am not sure he likes me for 100% certainty, I'll doubt every small decision I make and question the reasons behind every small thing he does.  In the end of the day, I feel very unique about this, it doesnt sound as good on paper but its just really fitting to my personality, it makes me feel unique.  Wow I'm going on full essay mode, I should stop. 
That is touching :) I'm so glad your happy and healthy! 
It sounds like such a cute personality trait too, I bet you love it.  
Seriously? Read "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Robert Glover.  Like you said, where you are is both a positive and a negative. You come first, always. 
That's great! Do you raise Charolais or Brahma? I reckon if they're good sized you probably don't raise Jerseys or Dexters. I've heard some have really good luck bringing in a Brahma bull to cross with some of the English breed cattle to get really good calves, particularly in hotter climes. 
Do you think you re more disciplined than motivated? How do u gain that motivation? 
same!! I admire you so much for becoming a therapist; I wish I could, but I don't think I'd be able to separate other people's emotions from my own in a way that would keep me psychologically healthy. you rock :) 
Same. Everyone tells me everything because they know I have no one to tell their secrets to 
If I could capture one feeling, bottle it, and sell it for $10 a hit, it would be the feeling I get when I suddenly realize that I'm reading a /u/fuckswithducks comment. 
That's great :) At least your growing into a more confident person !  
Most likely she assumed you were trying to pick her up when she was vulnerable. 
This sounds like me, with that positive kind of fuck it. I like that also! 
Is this a case of being book smart but not real world smart? 
This is me as well. It's the fastest way to distract myself from a depressive mood, just by diving into a new subject that has long piqued my interest. I have a pretty long list of bookmarked articles and podcasts that I store up for just such occasions.  
Just by reading that I started feeling low about myself. 
T Total! Good on you! Not many people can say this!  
Stay safe! You only have one life don't cut it too short 
You feel inferior or you feel everyone is inferior to you? 
Yeah will Hitler liked comics too.    **edit** So did the real hitler 
Refusing to go to Seaworld, definitely a good guy. 
I miss my ex's elementary school aged brother more than her. He was a cool little dude. 
I think there's a solid chance your dad doesn't like coffee but likes going to get coffee with you. Just saying. 
Some nerds make amazing spouses.  Im dating one and everyone in the family has offered too marry him(Jokingly) just to keep him in the family. 
The year was 1892  We don't know what became of Albert after that... 
If I met a guy like this I'd let him come across me 
Nothing is more beautiful than a mans relationship with his hot dog. 
I hope this story is true! Way to throw it back at him! 
I have never had a boyfriend who had any interest in being courteous or friendly with my siblings/their SO's/my friends before until my current one. It makes such a refreshing difference, and feels like he actually gives a shit about me and cares about my life.  
And there were condoms in the drawer under the bathroom sink? 
Also a daughter my dad said "I like the way he looks at you." This was a couple days after we got married. But that's how I knew I didn't make a mistake. 
Okay so I just met the parents of my girlfriend last Thursday and I spoke to them a little bit. It was a little awkward for the three of us (the parents and me) but we had a little bit of small talk while I we were helping ing pack my gfs things. This isn't bad right?  Thank you everyone for the help you're all too kind :) 
I've had a crush on Link since 1999.  It's probably been good for me, because the characteristics I imagined Link to have (hard working, patient, kind, etc) were all great qualities to pursue in young men. My husband is my Link. I am well loved by the kindest, most patient, and hard working man I've ever met.  
Man I hate that my daughter, 6 years old, is getting attention from boys already. One of the boys on her soccer team gave her a plastic rose and it made me realize all three of my girls are going to have boys chasing them like dogs. The boy that gave her the rose is a nice and sweet little boy but i just want to tell him to back the fuck off. I think I'm ok for now though, she's a bit of a tomboy and doesn't have interest in boys yet.  
Wish I had an office, how do I get one of these neckbeard losers? 
Care to enlighten those redditors who aren't meta enough? Asking for a friend  
Need to be careful with that. It needs to be understood that it is mostly an affectionate joke or it could cause some serious social and relationship issues for her down the road.  I have a sibling who ONLY dates a demographic that my dad dislikes and she's admitted that it's partly because of the whole 'don't date till college' and to spite him for doing the whole 'princess' thing to her. She hates that with a passion. 
That's a bit too far for burning a 4 year old alive. Probably like give him a scare telling the kid He's gonna be a daddy. 
I actually met my boyfriend online and now I live with him. My mom was very harsh about me dating someone long distance that I had never met in person. But since I moved in with him and he drove me across the country to visit my family, she seems to be pretty fond of him. My grandma wouldn't talk to him though.   I'm glad you're okay with your daughter having long distance relationships. The way my mom acted was pretty upsetting to me. 
Oh, like presenting yourself as an acceptable human being ? Who would've thought. 
If I took a salad when I first met my now in-laws, my father-in-law would have laughed me out of the house.   My mother-in-law would have also been offended if I brought something along as I was invited to their house for dinner as their guest, her thought process would have been 'is my food not good enough?'  I think once you know them it is fine but bringing things the first few times you meet them is well overboard. 
I love this. And can relate completely.   Congratulations to you! It's hard to rebuild, but can be so worth it. 
Shit man, I'm on the same chapter but it's chapter 26 in my book. Mundane career, sex has decreased drastically, and just smile at the neighbors. Does it get any better towards 30? 
Me: I want a girlfriend  Also me: *makes no effort to find one* 
When you're a granny you should have a chapter called Sewing. 
You too huh. Welcome to my life. Wife passed away from cancer in February. 
I'm 23 as well and I totally feel you on this, but just know you're not alone, buddy. 
No no no.  You've set yourself up pretty well. Go ahead and try. Worst case scenario you try again, maybe a different way. Don't let your brain talk you out of it. Brains are dumb and lazy. They don't want to put in the effort. You know better. Go pick up something heavy please.  
Trying to hard may be the problem.  I gave up on dating for like 3 years and out of nowhere I met and am with probably the most amazing and best match for me.  Never stop looking but dont make it a must have.  
I know parents that still has full control of all of their kids' income. 'kids' as in mid 20s adults with full salary incomes. My friend still has to ask his mom if he can go replace his iPhone 4 for a new one with his own money  
Happened to me! Quit that job- what a dick- still have nightmares about it 
I knew a guy in the Navy who brought his new wife overseas to his duty station to be with him. She wanted to stay behind and finish college but he wanted her nearby so he could "keep an eye" on her. When she arrived she was specifically prohibited from interacting with Navy wives. He got a place off base so she wouldn't bump into anyone who was American.  Then he insisted on doing all of the shopping with her. She had to stay in their apartment, with no internet, waiting for him to come home (dinner was expected upon his arrival).   When he told me about all of the restrictions he placed on her I was resolved to go to fleet family services about it if it didn't resolve in a month (lots of folks came overseas with weird notions of how they would live only to dramatically change course soon after). Fortunately she left his weird ass a few weeks later. 
My father did this to my mother. He controlled the money. Even though she worked all day taking care of their five children, he made her do extra tasks like wash the cars or do some random unnecessary thing before he would give her money for our groceries. It was never enough money to feed us all easily. My mom had to coupon and deal shop like a pro. At the time, I thought we were terribly poor and my father was an asshole. Now I know he was just an asshole. He's gotten less controlling as time has passed/my mom has gotten more of a backbone. However, I am definitely affected by the emotional abuse and control he had over the family.  
Having a mother who does this is a living hell.  None of my career interests and hobbies feel important when all she does is to downtalk me all my life about them. Grew up with a major sense of inadequacy and I don't think I'll ever shake this off for the rest of my life.  Having excessively narcissistic mothers can beat you down 
My ex used to do this.  Bonus points if he knew I needed to pee, he would start finding every pot hole and bump in the road. 
I hated being friends with someone because my parents needed their full name, phone number, if there was an adult supervising us, said adult's number, where I was going, and when I was gonna be home. Some friends understood, others thought it was super weird when I thought it was normal up until I got more friends but couldn't hang out with them. 
I find the way Jerry is treated on Parks & Rec really upsetting for this reason. 
Yeah at 14 I was allowed to decide which of my divorced parents I wanted to live with. I chose to stick with the status quo (switching between them every week) even though my dad was emotionally abusing me and I wanted to live with my mom. I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings even with the abuse and neglect. Children love their parents and will rarely express their true feelings when asked to choose between them. 
My step grandfather did this to his wife too. He did it to hide the fact that he was 80 with a 20 year old daughter that he had with his mistress that was half his age. He had been paying their bills for years behind his wife's back. His wife was the sweetest lady you had ever met and super talented. It was really sad that everyone knew but her.   When he passed away my stepfather had to take care of her (his grandmother) and her bills because no one else wanted to help her. He's a great guy and very sweet as well. 
My father in law did this with my husband while we were dating. He went to do it one night and I used my mother voice and said, "this is completely unacceptable and you will stop it right now. He needs his sleep." Truly thought he was going to hit me for it, but he took his drunk ass back to his own house and didn't speak to me for like three months. He doesn't pull that shit much now. 
Management does this too as a subtle form of workplace bullying. Employees who can't trust their own work or decisions become easier to push around. 
i'd say pay me or I won't do it if not report his dumb arse to HR 
Isn't that a felony? You can get close to 10 years in Illinois for that, I can't speak for other states though. 
I work at a public library, and we regularly have a group of semi-independent adults come in. They are well enough to live on their own, but still need assistance with a lot of things. Some of the people in charge are *awful.* There's one lady in particular who is so controlling and rude and mean to these people. She was temporarily banned for spitting on a library staff member (me) in an argument, because I was allowing one of the adults to follow library set guidelines, not her guidelines, as her's were arbitrary and the adult in question was capable of understanding that he was in charge of the material. But she came back this week and is just as terrible as ever. 
My mom has been ill and in chronic pain for over half my life.   My ex-boyfriend used to tell me that my mother was still sick because I didn't have enough faith in God. It wasn't until I told someone else about it months after that comment that I knew that spiritual abuse was a thing. Granted, this is a much milder form of spiritual abuse. 
Okay, so me and an ex have been discussing this lately. We're still friends, but we dated and had sex for a while. She thinks that if a future boyfriend/girlfriend for me or her would have an issue with us hanging out, that's on them and not our issue. I actually feel that it's not entirely unreasonable not to want your current girl/boyfriend to have a lot of 1 on 1 time with their ex. I see it from both sides but I'd definitely have an issue with that. If it's group contexts because of mutual friends it's one thing, but 1 on 1 I'd have genuine issues with. 
Love bombing as a means of control. It wasn't about her wanting you to have nice new furniture, it was about how she looked buying you the nice new furniture. Hence the reason she still holds it over your head today. I have faith that people like that get found out in one way or another, eventually.  
I think a YouTuber got his kids taken away recently over this.  
A girl I know was emotionally abused by her girlfriend for years. In the end the abuse became physical. The manipulation went so deep that after she got out, she had herself psychiatrically evaluated because she was genuinely worried she was a "narcissistic, manipulative bitch" like her ex said she was (She wasn't, she's one of the nicest and supportive people I know)  She's in grad school now and is part of a much healthier relationship.  
Id rather have physical abuse sometimes than verbal. Some people can be... creative, in their insults. 
My grandmother once tried to force me to show off my full length chest scar to a friend of hers. I didn't want to and she went fucking batshit on me about embarrassing her in front of him.  Like I wasn't embarrassed enough about being cut open, having to undo a shirt and flash this mother fucker in the middle of an amusement park.  I was like 13 and had just started developing. 
Mmm I think the acceptable form of "tough love" is when you're being honest and accepting a situation. A lot of the time we try to hide or deny any problems when deeper down we know what is wrong/right.  
Yes, this was the story of my life for several years. My (then) husband has an impressive salary but I had to beg him for change to take the bus.   I stayed with him for much longer than I wanted to because I couldn't afford to leave.  
Nothing makes me more wary of a person who "jokes" about harming animals.   And to a lesser extend, I am wary of people who are apathetic of the suffering of animals. If they don't care if an animal is suffering, I don't want to know how they are with people. 
Yes!  I was abused emotionally and seems like people are under the impression since they put  a roof over my head and fed me I wasn't abused and I was just acting like a spoiled brat. 
On the flip side in family law cases I've seen parents point blank deny their child has an issue (even though the other parent, school teachers, mental health specialists all see the symptoms and agree). Denying access to the medication is just as harmful as overprescribing  
I get "talked to" at work a lot about allowing potty breaks. I tell the boss point blank, I will never, ever deny anyone the use of the toilet.   I might offer to set up a visit with the school nurse if it gets excessive though.  
am a woman, and mostly have guy friends. with my girl friends we discuss red flags and what not, and there is a general understanding of what is abusive behavior. With my guy friends I was really surprised on how many red flags just flew over their heads.   
I'm bi and my ex straight up didn't want me to have friends.  
Dude in some cases, emotional abuse fucks you up more than physical abuse. You mentioned the "if you break up with me i'll kill myself" and that could not be more true. In highschool i heard this shit constantly because no one understands the mental strain and confusion that sort of threat puts on someone. yes, it's a threat and should be treated as one. i break up with this person, they kill themselves because of it and now what? all i would think about is it's my fault that person lost their life and that could end up with you ending your own life. such a horrible thing to say to someone that's about to end the relationship in all honesty.  
I had always felt stupid growing up.  It was the early 90's and in my area there was no real talk of learning disabilities.  I just got scolded from teachers about how I didn't "apply myself".  It improved slightly in high school (still got shit grades) and then I went to college because that's what you're supposed to do, right?  As my college years went on, I improved from being a lackluster student to pretty good upon graduation.  And then, when I went into "the real world" (you know, the one your parents told you would eat you alive, etc.) I started doing pretty good, and my managers would compliment my work and abilities.  But even to this day, when I get a work compliment I think they're bullshitting me and I think I am absolutely horrible at my job because of how many years I spent hearing how much I sucked in school.   
I feel good most of the time, working out, socializing, enjoying my cigarette and my walk. I feel confident. But it wasn't always like that, so when a day or two come when I feel down, I always fear that it will spiral down and that I will end where I was few years ago. That makes me even more sad. But it didn't spiral down so far. 
I feel this as well. Wife's dad was dying over a few days and I was focused on the logistics not the emotions, which came later. But I felt like a sociopath not caring in the moment about it.  
It's so terrifying when the one thing that you think you can always count on being consistent (yourself and your thoughts) becomes out of your control.  
I remember on one of those Askreddit "what secret could you never tell anyone?" posts someone talked about how they had a few drinks with the mother of an autistic child one night, and she started talking about how the kid had pretty much ruined her entire life. All her time had been devoted to this child, who, even when he moved out, still had to be taken care of by his parents almost 24/7. She finished it off with saying she wishes he'd just die already.  It was fucking heartbreaking.  
I feel the "call of the void" in social situations, which is interesting because I have pretty intense social anxiety, and so some social situations can feel like life or death to me. I occasionally get the urge to do super weird things in public. Like if I'm in a crowded place, I think about jumping up on a table and screaming and ripping my clothes off. Or if I'm in an elevator, I think about screaming. 
Never thought of it in that way but "meta worry" seems to sum up a concept that I've been trying to verbalize for a while. 
I have diagnosed OCD, and I often get thoughts or images that I hate so much it makes my entire body wretch/crumple.  It's like hating the thoughts so much makes them happen more often.  Totes sucks breh  
As long as you aren't hearing them reply, then it's normal. Everyone talks to themself occasionally.  
Right.  There are enormously profitable industries devoted to making people feel badly about themselves.  One time I saw an ad for some cosmetology service.  The "real customer" was a mom who wanted acceptance from her children because they were supposedly embarrassed by her (normal) appearance.  I hope this isn't something which people are actually insecure about because that sounds really sad. 
It's called perfectionism. If you can handle the stress and misery it can throw at you, you can soar to heights and successes those around you couldn't even imagine. You just need to deal with the fear of failure and constant belief of its not enough. Find the balance and you can do amazing things.  
I do the same thing! I do it as a coping technique to deal with anxiety.  
what if as a kid I had really low self esteem and thought there was no way anyone could actually like me so all my friends were just pretending to so i didnt feel bad. 
I know what you mean.    I am an alcoholic in recovery, and establishing myself in a community of like-minded people was critical in my recovery. If I had continued to surround myself exclusively with the people I knew in my active drinking, then nothing would have changed.    I am a big fan of 12-Step programs, as well as support groups and online communities for whatever problems seem to arise.    This allows people to go from "People around me mean well, but nobody understands" to "These guys get it! They're just like me".    But making newer, healthier relationships is easy to say, and hard to do. At least with support groups, there's a common bond, and a context for interaction where people can practice these skills. 
I assume most people just think of intelligence in a way that benefits them. For example, a person who is good at math will take that as evidence of his above average intelligence, while someone else might talk about how he's good at making life decisions, etc. 
I hope you're both holding up okay. I wish I had something more constructive to say than that. Just know that an internet stranger is thinking of you both and wishing you the best in this hard time.  
People just don't understand senses in general and that there are more than five. Thanks, Platobama. 
Again, not a psychologist, but I've been told that it's the way you respond to intrusive thoughts that determines whether or not you have a problem. A "normal" person might have an intrusive violent thought and just sort of think, whoa, that was a weird thought, and never think any more of it. Someone with OCD could have the same violent intrusive thought and spend ages worrying what it means about them as a person, worry that they are dangerous and a future murderer, take precautions to prevent becoming a murderer (e.g. avoid contact with people, avoid touching knives, etc). I was told that people with OCD tend to place too much significance on their intrusive thoughts, and struggle to understand that thinking a horrible thought does not mean they will then act on that thought. I hope this makes some sense - I saw an OCD specialist a while back and am trying to paraphrase what they told me. 
Not the same but similar.   Without going in to detail I had a moderately shitty childhood and now, whenever I'm not distracting myself with something too stimulating to prevent it, I get intense flashbacks to negative events. It can be a different one each time, or the same one repeatedly for a week.   Like you said it's just like being there again, particularly emotionally, and afterwards I'm left upset at having to deal with it and angry that something relatively trivial and from so long ago can affect me so much today, and a bad one can really throw my day out. It's been happening for ~10 years now and is slowly getting worse each year.  So long story short, idk if it's normal, but you're not alone and I hope things get better for you. 
one of the comments say that imposter syndrome isnt as common as everyone thinks and now you're saying the exact opposite. who do i believe lol 
As a kid i believed that if i just wish for something hard enough, like turning time backwards so i can do my test again or so, i would wake up the next morning and it would have happend... shitty kid's movies brought me to these assumptions and life smacked them out of me 
This is the stupid shit I would say and be haunted by forever. 
"Can you say the alphabet backwards?"  "teb ah pla" 
Funny aside, the MR2 is named diferently in France, 'cause MR2 sounds like "it's shitty" in french. Toyota "est merdeux"... 
"wow your job is cleaning police uniforms? Such a niche!"  
Have a friend who had a bike that actually got ticketed for not wearing a seatbelt while riding. He of course fought the ticket in court and it was dismissed.  Asshole cop just wanted to waste my friend's time I guess.   
Cop: Were you drinking a coke whilst driving?  Me: Can't I drink and drive?  Cop: Erm...definately not  Me: But I could smoke?  Cop: Yes.  Me: Then I was smoking some coke.  Cop: Please step out of the car Sir. 
When I was there, they were all wearing deinm as a form of labor protest.  At first, I just thought Canadian cops wore denim. 
Thats a trick they use, if you laugh you probably don't have anything to hide, but if you say no sternly then they'd probably search the car 
I said something similar to a doctor before he put staples in my head. He did not let me off with a warning. 
Either you follow rules 1 and 2. Or you are ugly and he felt sorry for you. 
Haha...Once, i got pulled over for passing some guy that was going 35 in a 55. I sped past him and went about 65 mph, but I guess I was close to him and I ended up crossing the fog lines...  anyways, guy pulls me over and as soon as he sees my last name, he asks "Are you X's son?" and I answer "yeah". (my dad was a firefighter and knows a bunch of cops, etc)  and he says he'll let me off with a warning, but he is definitely gonna tell my dad about my reckless driving.   He never said anything to my dad but I really don't think I was reckless. Oh well.  
I'm sorry officer I didn't know I couldn't do that.  
Yeah, TSA customs are stupidly anal.   When I was 13 and coming back from a vacation in England, I had some guy completely flip shit screaming at me because I dared to pull my old ass iPod out of my pocket for about 2 seconds to check the time, not realizing that was a problem. I got bitched at by some grouchy middle aged dude and he went on for a solid minute over it.   Like, is that *really* necessary to flip shit on some kid over something so stupid? Just say "Hey, that's not allowed put it away" 
Yeah don't ever swear in front of a cop. They'll travel through heaven and hell to make sure every expletive you say gets on the report. 
The only way you can get arrested for drugs at a festival is if they catch you selling hard drugs in front of them. If they were to arrest everyone who had taken something at a festival there would be no festival.  
He laughed *and then* smiled? How did he laugh without smiling? 
I'm sorry - four cops had to warn you for jaywalking? Were you carying a flame thrower or something? 
I honestly dont understand the rules with public intoxication.. I feel like you shouldn't be punishable unless youre actually disrupting people, but what do i know. 
This reminds me of a story I read on a similar thread a year or two ago. A college costume party got shut down by the cops, but one guy dressed as Captain Sparrow was able to get to the edge of the balcony on the second floor. As the cops surrounded him, he drunkenly shouted, "Gentlemen, you will always remember this day as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!"  He broke both legs on impact and got his minor in possession.  
My husband was pulled over in high school one night on his way home from work.  "Son, you didn't use your blinker."  "Uhm...my blinker is still on. Is my light out?"   "Don't be a smartass! Where are you coming from?"   *looks down at his Sonic uniform* "Work..."  "And where are you going this time of night?"  "Home. That driveway right there. That's my dad like....right there."   "What's in the backseat? DON'T MAKE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS. WHAT. IS IN. THE BACKSEAT?!"  "I don't fucking know by fucking memory, my girlfriend keeps shit back there, i keep shit back there. What specifically are you asking about?"  "The briefcase!"  ".....that's a CD wallet. Look, i have to piss, i'm pulling into my driveway now. My license is right here, you can write me a damn ticket but i'm going to go take a leak."   He got back out, no ticket, and the cop had left.  
Thanks to you, I will now forever carry a copy of the emancipation proclamation in a brown paper bag in my pocket. Thank you for this. :) 
Our tax dollars at work in the most productive way! :D 
At first I was confused, then I remembered Murica and their wacky drinking laws 
I've been in the car when a friend has gotten pulled over, it was night and the cop got really close to the back of his car and turned his brights on (probably to read his license plate/registration sticker) and my friend switches lanes in the hopes the cop was trying to pass him.  When the cop switched lanes too, you could see it in his face he knew he was fucked. 
Same thing in France, you're not allowed to put anything in your ears, unless medical prescribed (hearing aid) or while taking your motorcycle practice exam (getting directions).  Apparently, it distract you, but you can still blast music from your car's speaker or put speakers in your helmet.  Who knows why then.  Got arrested but they probably didn't know it was forbidden. 
You can still call 911 and tell them it's not an emergency. 
Riced out Honda civics must be pretty quick in his books then 
lmao he actually took you up on your offer? hilarious 
Sounds pretty similar to my story. I was 17 at the time.   **Cop: you know how fast you were going?**  **Me: about 70? (55MPH zone)**  **Cop: close enough. Do you know the speed limit down this road?**  **Me: ...you pulled me over, so it's obviously not 70.**  I thought it was funny. Him, not so much. He still only gave me a ticket for 9 over, instead of 15, so that was nice.    
Are you telling me you didn't walk up to him and ask "Do you know why I pulled you over?" 
"Where are you coming from?"  "Definitely not a bank robbery sir." 
The correct response would've been, "I always let my bitches light  my cigarettes." 
Lmao you never have the right of way turning right on red. Like I know you can but you have to yield to literally any other traffic, that cop is a moron. 
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Smartass the Wise? 
That's ridiculous. In Ontario you're legally required to move over when a police officer has someone pulled over on the side of the road, and oftentimes people will move over for *any* car on the side of the road to give them room.  
That's where you keep your right to a speedy trial? 
I was caught with a half oz. on Christmas Eve going through a roadblock once..   Cop said, "Good thing Santa's in a good mood"  Let me keep my weed and sent me on my way.  P.S. I'm Canadian 
Be carefull, you don't need to be caught by a radar or lidar to face a speeding ticket.  It becomes a your word vs the cops word in court and since the cop works the traffic department he is also considered an expert in the field.  Cop says to judge he was driving faster then 55, big chance judge takes his side over yours. 
Fuck, was it that bad your child didn't want to see him? It is a shame when kids cant voice their opinion 
I've used this one before. Cop grabbed my junk. Was more a caress than a frisk. I didn't get a ticket, but I left a little confused. I was seventeen. 
This one was really good, but who is the original quote attributed to? I refuse to google it   
"Our words are backed by nuclear weapons!" -Thankfully not Hitler 
This was kind of his real philosophy...he couldn't stand the idea of the Nazi party making mistakes, so anything "bad" that happened he found a way to pretend it was on purpose or positive. 
"If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best." 
Yeah, it's not that good a quote coming from mother Theresa either... Considering she was in it to convert people not to save them. 
GIMME FUE GIMME FAI GIMME DAWAJADAZA  -Adolf Hitler 
He is full of good, positive, badass quotes. He was quite the speaker.   That was kinda the problem. 
'I'm not a serial killer dad, I'm an assassin! Well the difference is one's a job and the others mental sickness!' 
"if I were your wife I'd poison your tea"  "if you were my wife I'd drink it"  Hey, you're right! 
I'm pretty sure it's Abrahoff Linkler... but i'm wrong. Just looked it up. 
I mean, she *did* have an affair with a German officer and involve herself with the Nazi war machine... 
This entire setup sounds like the start of a really good horror story. 
How *sweet* and honorable it is to die for one's country.   
I wanted to confess my love for someone on a drunk night, but I didn't want to be direct, so I posted it on My Story on Snapchat.   Hangover me wanted to kill himself.  
Well....she kinda had a point.  I mean, if someone stabs someone in your honor, etiquette requires a thank you. Even if it is just to stop yourself from getting stabbed. 
I've had a girl do this  - except her kissing face was one of the cutest things I've ever seen  - and her lips may have been the softest and best shaped I've ever felt  So instead of being the worst kiss, it was a top 10 for best pecks ever 
Haha this reminds me of me and my now husband, who out of nerves actually *backed away* from me when I leaned in for a kiss on our third date. It was his first kiss, luckily I was aware of that and knew it was just nerves. Had to do the soft "wait..", just like you! 
That was a big thing on MSN messenger too. Wanna video chat? Not really as you will know my 'lols' aren't genuine because you aren't very funny 
A girl I dated in high school kept up a box with all the poems and flowers I gave her, some photos. Etc. We reconnected a few times after college, but it was always short-lived. She got married, and her husband does not like me at all. Eventually, she started being really rude to me as well. We lost touch, even though I tried to patch things up in a friendly way. One day, I was visiting my hometown, and a very nice teenager stops me in the street and asked me my first name. Then she tells me she is my ex high school girlfriend's daughter, and that her mom still has the box, and that sometimes, when she has had a few glasses of wine, she gets the box out and she reads the poems with her daughter.  
Yeah... You don't preface a first date proposal with "I love you".  
This isn't even embarrassing, just plain psycho! What happened?  
Hah a friend of mine in the miltary's wife wanted to name their kid after me too. Felt pretty honored...pretty sure she wasn't hitting on me. He won some bet though and got to pick the name...Logan Tiberius Lastname...named his kid after Wolverine and Captain Kirk's dad. 
That's a huge red flag. She's basically already telling you not to date her, or she'll drop you for someone else as soon as she loses interest. 
The public confession is really sneaky. It's like blackmail. 
This reminded me of this one time in elementary school when my friends pressured me into "dating" a boy who lived on my street, while on the school bus together.  We got off at our stop, he tried to hold my hand, and I ran to my neighbor's house and made him chase the boy off.  Last I heard, he dated a friend's sister and put revenge porn of her online. I had a moment where I wondered if I was the one to make him so hateful towards women. 
I can almost relate. Had a "girlfriend" in middle school who would say cryptic shit and then respond with "Dont worry about it" when questioned 
Are you sure that wasn't his plan? You did stay even longer because if it. 
That...is... kind of creepy... Did you break up with her? Imagine if you were also part of the tattoo 
...and that's why you don't put all your points in INT while keeping perception at 0. 
I am so intrigued as to who it is...but oh god so much cringe  
Did you have to circle it or did he have to just assume . 
Honesty is always the best policy. It's attractive. If it were me, I'd have just shit my pants.  
Freaky! When I first met my wife she walked over to me, said hi and started to sit down next to me, farted, laughed, got up and walked away.   Later I tracked her down and introduced myself and apologized if I smelled like toot because of this "crazy" girl earlier. 
Heh, I had a friend that was a bartender and she dated a biker guy. She didn't like him because of the bike, she actually hated it. Well, anyways, one of her regulars at the bar was very obviously enamored with her, but he was quiet and I think a little slow. Well, he saw her boyfriend, and came back the next night with a cheap leather jacket, holey jeans, and a wallet chain (before he was a khakis and polo kind of guy). She asked for his drink order and he started explaining that he bought the leather jacket because he was getting a motorcycle soon. We could tell he was building up to ask her if she wanted to go out, so she interrupted him and asked what he wanted to drink more sternly. He told her, she walked off, got his drink, set it in front of him, and walked away again. The other bartender then served that guy about 3 more beers, all of which he drank in complete silence before just leaving. I never saw or heard anything about him after that. 
What the fuck???? The first one was pretty funny but the second one... Ouch 
Wow. What you did wasn't even "embarrassing," that's pretty damn reasonable. At least everyone got a first-class education in dickery that day (I'm hoping at least SOMEONE said something. If not, then I'll say it: what a bitch- and yes, if the genders were reversed I'd still call that person a bitch). 
I'm glad you were proud of him, but that part made me actually laugh out loud. 
See, that was the first mistake... you always buy the plunger first. Why? Because when you need a plunger, you need a plunger ***NOW***.   The same logic could also apply to toilet paper, antidiarrheals, etc. as well I suppose... just buy all that crap in advance or you're gonna have a really shitty time 
I dated a girl (ok it was FWB) that told me her biggest turn off ever was guys burping, but farting was fine.  "If you need to burp just fart instead".  I tried to explain that that's not how the gastrointestinal system works.  
Well he sounds like the very best, like no-one ever was... 
This. This just. God. Like, I just don't know anymore.  Everyday we stray further from the light. 
Prithee and forsoothe   Meyst thinks thoust is couthe.    I loveth you from crown to foot.   Thyst has a most rocking butt....       Take that sprog. 
Same. Mine's having a rough day at work. I better get dinner on the table before she walks in. 
I don't think a dude's nipple popping out isn't that embarrassing, reverse the situation tho... 
Ask your friends to get a copy of that song and finish the song with him, using his name and any pronouns to invert the names and pronouns he's using. Switching up the roles in the song, is basically what I'm trying to say. It probably make his day.  
So many questions. How close were you to this babysitter to have a rapport with the daughter? How old were you? How old was she?  
*slaps roses out of her hands* "Lilacs! How many times do I have to tell you I like LILACS" 
Oh God, NYE. Senior year of college we celebrated up at school. I was taking a class over the break, so some people were there, and some made the drive up. I was both stoned and drunk by the time midnight rolled around, and was just chilling on the couch. A girl who knew the same people I did that was at the house we were at just walks over, sits next to me, and tries to initiate a NYE make out. I'm far from sober, but was in no way attracted to her, so I just turned my head when she went in for it. She spent the rest of the night crying in someone's room being comforted by her friends.  
I would have melted. Im a huge fan of Friends and have begged my husband to get lobster tattoos  
He was hedging his bets. If you had rejected him, he would have sent you "Slowly lowers hand".

Famous is one comment with all the attention. Common is when the attention is split up between lots of identical comments. 
I inherited a house from my parents. It was built in the mid 50s and they purchased in the mid 70s. In that time, they did very minimal, if any actual maintenance. One time, the home owner's insurance company wanted to see a new roof (or maybe repaired?) on the house. My parents just got somebody to spray it down with bleach water to make it pass their inspection. That's the kinda shit they'd pull to avoid having to pay for anything. I'm about to have a new roof installed but all the wood from the overhang is rotted and gross. Then there's the plumbing...and the electric with no ground wires...  When all is said and done, it will still be worth more than what I'm putting in to it right now. That's the only thing that keeps me here. 
Well, I'm better than dirt!  Well, most kinds of dirt. I mean not that fancy store bought dirt. That stuffs loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff.  
I was trying to figure out how those two things are related 
I used to make rugs, can confirm. People would bring us carpet scraps to bind or serge and look at me like I'm insane when I say it's $4-6 per foot for the specialty binding they wanted. Then there were the people who brought in boat or RV carpet and were shocked when I told them that we charged for every inside corner.  
Yup, I had to take a short ambulance ride from my work to the hospital which was about 6 blocks away.  I initially told them I don't want to go in an ambulance but management said don't worry it will be taken care of so I went.  A couple weeks later I got a bill for like $600. 
I know how much my interest is costing me, I just choose to ignore it.  Amortization tables: *not even once*  [Mostly kidding, but I did just finance a car and the first 20-30 lines of the amort. table are pretty sad] 
And for older pets, unexpected diagnoses that require lots of maintenance. We took our senior cat in for a suspected bladder infection, left with a diabetes diagnosis and insulin prescription. Insulin is expensive, and the food we give him now is too ($100/month for two cats).  
I'm on accutane right now, after having dealing with acne for about 10 years now.  I've spent literal thousands on products, and not only that if it wasn't for my insurance accuutane would be $3,000 for a 30 day supply. With insurance it is only $5.  It's fucking crazy. 
Near me is Shopper's Drug Mart, which offers reasonable grocery convenience purchases, but at a price.  It's right next to a transit hub.  A couple km away there's Superstore, where things are typically about two-thirds the price of Shopper's.  But it's really hard to get there by bus.   People who use buses to get their groceries (i.e. poor people) get fucked pretty hard by this scenario. 
Yes this is so underrated.  Especially when people want to offer you a commission and pay in "experience" or "it will be a good portfolio piece".    Dude i just had to decide whether i will pay for groceries or a tube of white paint.  Shits costly. 
I bought my IPhone 5s outright for $100 on Black Friday. Sure it's not the latest model but it does everything I need & I prefer this body style. I pay $55 a month for 12 gbs of data and have never lost signal. Even in a small town with a gas station that only is open during fishing season & maybe 50 homes. I love it. My uncle has the same exact phone on a major carrier and only has 8 GB of data.. he pays $120 a month...  
Or just request to be thrown in the trash like Frank Reynolds 
THIS. Won a gold fish at a fair 6 years ago. Started in a ten gallon tank. Then a 20 gallon tank. Now he's pretty comfy in a 100 gallon tank that cost me hundreds of dollars. The kicker is the large filtration system needed to sustain the tank and the incredible waste goldfish produce cost MORE than the tank itself. The cost of replacing certain parts of the filter every two weeks-a month are well over $100.  Goldfish are ridiculously expensive if cared for properly. But most people put them in a bowl. Mines almost a foot long now so he doesn't even fit in a bucket.   10/10 wouldn't be as excited about winning a free goldfish ever again. 
Omg yes! We have needed to have new windows installed since we bought our house a decade ago....but we have 20 freaking windows at about $500-$700 a piece in total. That is a lot of damn money.  
I don't know about you, but I can feed myself for 3 days on 2 pizzas no problem. ....I'd be concerned if someone eats two pizzas in a shorter frame of time. 
Why would the family even pay it? Not sure how a train company could hold a family liable for an individual who killed themselves. I would think that's why they have insurance? 
How do you spend $50,000 for coffee brewing equipment? 
But flying across an ocean in a seat that reclines completely flat with a belly full of champagne is pretty fucking fantastic. 
"Buy once, cry once" is a good rule to live by.  I usually buy decent quality stuff so I don't have to keep buying cheap stuff when it breaks.  My ex would constantly be buying phones (like every 3-4 months) because she would get cheap ones and they would break.  I get a good quality phone and it lasts me for years.  I don't have to keep replacing it and it is a nice phone.  Same with a lot of (not all) products. 
It's less development itself and more testing it enough you know it's safe. 
Any acoustic instrument, really.... my $8000 cello is the most expensive thing I own BY FAR and is a "student instrument". 
Reloading will help you with the hunting rifle. Rounds for mine start at $1.50 for the cheap stuff, about $2 for anything you'd want to hunt with, and about $3 for the good stuff. And that's online prices, plus shipping. Counting that I already have the brass, I can reload to match the good stuff for about $1.50, and make practice ammo for 50 cents.   But it's hard to reload rat-tat-tat .223 for less than surplus ammo prices. People mainly reload that to get higher-end ammo quality for lower prices, like making $1.50 match bullets for about 60 cents each.   But yeah, it does get long-term expensive.  
If you can't afford a condom, you can't afford a child.  Looking at you, Philippines. 
My friend bought a house with his parents and he has got 4 warnings about his yard being a mess. He never does yard work and rarely hires gardeners. And smaller things like light bulbs going out. Yet he has big plans to redo the yards and finish the garage.  
I don't even think about wasting it, so much, although that's a big one.  Just the tasks that people will do themselves that someone else will do for a small amount of money.  I can change my own oil, but I won't. I have to go to the store to buy the parts, break out the tools, jack the car up, get dirty, clean up, dispose of the oil, and store an oil-coated container somewhere. There is no-freakin'-way it's worth $19 for me to do that, when the oil change guys will top off my fluids and give me a quick vacuum too.  There are lots of reasons to spend time to save money, and the less money you have, the less it takes to buy your time. But it's worth being aware of before you take on a lot of tasks. 
I'm sure your pizza is much better quality, but I can get frozen pizza at the grocery store for $5. I'd rather save the time and spend the extra $4.  
Its even better when your car is stolen. By some miracle the police find it and now you have impound fees up the ass. 
Depends on how you do it. My Youtube channel was just me, my phone, and my laptop. The channel grew *really* fast, and I was surprised to see myself grow without the expensive hardware. I think the only thing I have bought for my youtube channel was a blue yeti mic, so you don't need money to make a good channel, or any channel for that means. 
I hate seeing this in all of these topics.  You're not paying for the cost of ingredients. You're paying for the convenience of someone else doing it for you and not having to go home if you're already out.  Lots of foods/drinks are much more expensive if you get them away from home, but it's always coffee that people call out. 
Where do you live for a house to cost 300k?  Around here a broke down crack house is just shy of 1 mill 
Depends on what you eat and whether you actually cook food or buy stuff you just microwave.  I can do about $150 for food in a month if I just cook meals instead of buying pre-prepared food.  Beans, vegetables, rice, spices, and chicken are cheap as hell and can be prepared in a lot of ways. 
I had a spinal surgery that required breaking the ribs on my right side. Sneezed. Sobbed. Worst moment of the whole surgery. 
Wow that's terrible. I'm so glad you were able to be put into a coma to escape some of it. Hopefully you're doing well now.  
I'm 24 and I've had 4 kidney stones since 17. I've a broken few bones, doesn't even touch how kidney stones feel. Not even close. There is no way to escape the pain. No matter how you sit, lay, press on it, grind your teeth, nothing. Next time I have one I might just prefer a brick to the head instead of oxycodone and weed.        Best part is I know I'll have plenty more in my lifetime.  
appendicitis is also my answer.  was studying abroad in london, had a one night stand, guy didn't believe me in the morning that i could barely stand up.  somehow walked home, only to find my host family had ALL left for a short holiday.  i was alone.  in tears on the stairs to my program director who finally got another host family near by to come and take me to the hospital.  went to the er, waited for about two hours in excruciating pain, watched a paramedic get punched out by a drunk guy, couldn't sit, couldn't stand, nowhere to lay down.  finally got back to get checked out and the doctor barely laid his hands on my stomach, no pressure or anything, and i screamed SO loud the entire er went silent for a few seconds.    did not pay a dime for the surgery/hospital stay/medical bills though. thanks, england! 
*squeezes massive testicle*   Is this the one that hurts?   *no response, eyebrow twitches* 
Yes...that disease made me question my existence..it felt like some one was stabbing me with a white hot serrated knife and was going back and forth in my abdomen with the knife. The pain is relentless and i have had so many sleepless night because of the devil of the disease.  The pain made me throw up in the bathroom and pass out right there..  After an excision surgery 2 years ago, I am able to live an almost normal  I hope a cure is found in our lifetime and girls donot have to suffer.   
I got ear infections all the time as a baby.   I'm glad I was too young to remember it.  
My dad has TN. About three weeks ago he went for microvascular decompression surgery. It's the gold standard treatment for TN and it's been incredibly successful. He's still recovering from the op, but his pain hasn't returned at all and he says it's 100% worth it.   
My labor was induced using Pitocin. It ramped up the contractions to where they were seconds apart and I still was dilated at 2cm. Took some drugs, took a nap, woke up delirious and wanting more drugs and out popped a baby.   2 months later, I had my first major gallbladder attack. I couldn't walk, I couldn't move. Laying down or sitting up didn't make it better. The center of my chest felt like fire and ice at once. I bore through that for 2 hours before getting to the ER. Hands down, that was the absolute most horrendous pain I've ever experienced. I used to be a frequent flyer to the ER as a kid.. I've had parts of my bone sticking out of me and didn't feel any pain (shock is a helluva drug)... nothing compares to gallbladder attacks for me.  
ER doc here, this is one of the things I hate the most about the job. There's no good way to provide pain relief (local anesthetic often causes more pain like you alluded to) and the amount of pain inflicted during the treatment is absolutely horrendous. The worst part is that it's rarely a simple 'cut and drain' procedure, we have to take a pair of forceps and dig inside the abscess to break up the numerous closed-off pockets of infection. So we're basically digging around inside your body with blunt metal objects while you're screaming in pain. Like you said, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Sorry for your troubles, I hope it's all cleared up now. 
I have to second you in this. Very glad about it to. 
i can't believe they fucking held you down and circumcised you. it should be illegal to do a purely cosmetic surgery on a minor, especially if they're physically struggling against it  
In the beginning of this school year, we had this really awkward and squeamish student teacher in our biology class. My teacher thought it would be funny to tell us about her c-section and how she could feel the doctors moving her insides around and how the rest felt. He ran out of the classroom and I think he threw up. It was pretty funny. 
I've got 2 root canals scheduled. Never had one. Were you under anesthesia? Other that that quick flash was the rest painful? 
When I was 13 I broke a finger and it took 5 weeks to heal. Less than 1 week after I remove the splint, I broke my wrist on the other hand playing football. I started crying, not only because of the pain (It hurt like hell), but mostly because I would have to use a cast for another month or so, right in the middle of the summer holidays. I was devastated! 
Thought this said "canker sores on the vulva" and felt my lady parts wither up and die. 
I broke my tailbone and my mom made me go to the doctor they couldn't do anything except recommend Advil and ice. And it should be good within  a month or two. 3 days later football season started it's been a year and it still hurts.  
Pitocin is the devil. I was in it for 16 hours, most of that at a 4, no epidural for the first 10 hours, and pain so awful I started throwing up. All while my husband and stepson slept on the couch in the room at the hospital. Nothing has ever been as welcome as that anesthesiologist. 
Yup. White count booster after chemo round 4. It felt like being transformed into Wolverine when the inject the Adamantium into his bones. When you think of something in your hand or in your arm, you are considering it inside the flesh or muscles; the bones are supposedly 'solid'. The pain is a deeper level beyond something in my arm hurts. And that's not even the worst of it. Every bone hurts. Toes fingers whatever those are small and disposable. When your spine feels like someone just poured lava down it and you want to pull it out or your skull feels like the fires of mordor, then you will know pain.  
Sounds like post herpetic neuralgia. For older people it can make the pain come back, sometimes worse, and it can keep coming for months. Not common in young people. I had it myself at 18 and never experienced pain afterwards. Just the memories of agony 
My husband nearly died due to cops shooting off tear gas. Apparently in Eugene OR there's a yearly "riot" after the two unis play football or basketball or something. He was riding his bike home and a gas canister went off next to him. He collapses, because he's asthmatic. Cops drew fucking guns on him because he was desperately trying to crawl to his backpack, face erupting in snot and tears, to get his inhaler. They though he was getting a weapon. They then wouldn't let him go to the hospital until he was "questioned"... the man was just trying to get home from fucking work and they kept insinuating he was there to riot, despite being in his work uniform. 
I'm so sorry. I just learned about broken heart syndrome. What an intense loss you suffered. I hope time is dulling the edges of your pain.  
I had to have a suction abortion due to a sudden risk to my health during pregnancy. Literally a turned-on vacuum in your uterus. I have never screamed so hard in my life. Now I have endometrial cancer and have to get biopsies every 3 months. It's the same thing but with a tiny manual tube that works on vacuum pressure instead of electricity. I still cry every time. It's worse than the chemo. 
I've had stitches in my eyeball!!!   Unfortunately I no longer have that eyeball. Totally different story... Wrote a bit about it in this thread! 
did that on a motorcyle. Holy shit the pain. was able to walk away relatively unharmed, although  
I had that one night. That pain is unreal. I screamed and woke up my wife, but I couldn't actually tell her what was happening because I was crying and screaming and flailing in bed. The worst part is that you can usually stand up and stretch it out when you have it in one calf, but you can't when it's in both. All you can do is roll around in a fetal position and cry.  
Ah, yeah it's a fairly rare condition. It's formally known as Hurtslikeabitchitits. Sorry you had to experience that 
Everyone agrees because they define "critical thinker" as "someone whose views align with mine". 
Same. My initial reaction was that it sounds too much like #feelthebern  Then I realized it's much more of an issue that a campaign pushing for education uses a hashtag with completely nonexistent grammar.  It might as well be "#do a smart" 
yeah this is bullshit. shit makes it to /r/all just because of the potical subliminal messages 
If everyone thinks the same, then someone isn't thinking.   People will always continue to disagree with each other.    
Personally my math and physics classes in high school required a lot creativity and abstract thinking. I mean if you look at the average level of mathematics students are learning today compared to 50 years ago I'm sure you'd find an increasing level of abstraction.   
By teaching. Teachers have been fighting directly against "modern culture" for years, by dispelling myths and replacing them with facts.  It's met with resistance, but it's the only way. Otherwise everything just gradually slides backwards. 
No child left behind program didn't improve training it just lowered the bar. 
I apologize for the unsolicited advice here, but ToK caught my eye. I also wish that something like ToK could be accessible to all students.  Anyway, as someone who now works in higher education and also took IB courses in high school, I HIGHLY encourage you to still take your freshman level composition courses when you get to college, even if some form of tests or credit from IB/AP have allowed you to skip them (not sure how it might have changed since I've been in school). One of the biggest mistakes I see many intelligent students make is skipping freshman comp and not giving themselves more time to hone their writing and critical thinking skills at a college level. Take your time with any writing and critical thinking courses in college! I am a firm believer that we not only push high school kids to and through college at problematic rates, but that programs that allow you to skip college courses can sometimes do more harm than good for certain students.  
Who upvotes these pseudo anarcho bullshit rants? The most educated are not critical thinkers? What?  
That's a very loose interpretation of a system that encompasses many countries with millions of people working in them.   What business men? The curriculum in my province is made my educational professionals who don't benefit at all from stupid children.  In fact having met most of them they would be appalled by that idea. Many teachers try their hardest to make sure kids can think for themselves but you can't keep everyone at the same level in a bulk system.  
We definitely need more open minds. Philosophy can teach the intolerant that overwhelming existential dread binds all of us together. We all suffer from the human condition, regardless of where we come from, we all know we are going to die. 
Yeah. I've been teaching college level math for about 7 years. It is pretty common place for my colleagues to go on and on about "teaching critical thinking" and then have their students memorize a procedure so they can get the right answer without actually understanding anything.    This is exactly the opposite of critically thinking - It's sheepishly following instructions. I suspect high school is even worse judging from the level of understanding of a typical new college student.  
Ever since socratic method teaching was all about nurturing a critical thinking.  You must have a very peculiar interpretation of what "teaching" is. 
I don't completely agree with this view.  The bread-and-butter of a liberal arts degree or humanities degree are critical analysis papers.  You learn to formulate a thesis and construct a logical argument that backs up said thesis.  Coming up with a thesis, organizing it into paragraphs, and citing your work = critical thinking. 
They put him on trial for corrupting the youth (but really he was just a pain in the ass, and the sophists wanted to do something about him). At trial he was found guilty.  Funny thing is, the defense and the prosecution were allowed to ask for different punishments. The prosecution asked for death (but really all they wanted was exile, getting him out of their hair). Socrates, thinking exile was kinda bullshit, asked for a free lunch from the court for wasting his time. I'm totally serious here. Of course they told him no, and they had to go with the death sentence. 
I always wondered about the timeline of these men.   Thanks.  
Wrong. Tons of smart and educated people out there more evil than snakes.  
Beyond what we can gather form others who w rote about him. 
Isn't one of apology's English definitions defense though...? 
In the trial Socrates set his counterpunishment (as opposed to death) as being fed free food where the Olympic champions feast then added on although he had just a few silver his friends could pay a fine for him.   Pretty sure Socrates was fed up with Athens/Life and was ready to die at this point. He pretty much just didn't need to be a dick for a few hours and he souls his lived. 
I find my willingness to study philosophy for so long was fueled by immaturity and lack of care about future consequences. It is costing me much right now. 
I am a math professor. Can someone tell me what "smarter in math" means? 
I really hope the article wasn't written by philosophers who are actually bragging about their logic reasoning skills. 
Yeah philosophical arguments require learning formal logic, which itself is math.  And once you learn that, learning pretty much anything else, especially math becomes much easier. 
This is partially because of logic in both subjects, isn't it? 
I think children could be especially receptive to a Socrates. Pretty sure authority figures in education would want to clamp down on that shit in a hurry if the kids started learning too much from him, though. 
Negative examples can be helpful too. Or perhaps taking for positive example, the sparknotes for those particularly dense texts. ;) 
I think it's funny that they had to give critical thinking merit, by connecting it with math and English. As though any of them need the other two, in order to be a functional life tool... 
Check out 3 minute philosophy on youtube. It's a great primer on some of the basic ideas 
If by most you mean "a very, very small percentage", then sure.  
It's not about sitting in rows, filling out important forms, to sit in better rows and fill out more important forms-   It's about giving children the gift of critically thinking through multiple perspectives, As it can apply in life.- and it definitely can.  Do you think Trump would be president if children were introduced to philosophical concepts by age 10, about 50 years back?  Not that I'm frothy about it- but it's pretty obvious that people today have no grasp of philosophy. 
Really? Back it up with some links. Especially concerning Baseball and Magic improving english writing skills. Expanding your vocab by a few token words doesn't count. 
Hell, it had enough of an impact that I'm certain my views were affected before even knowing who Chomsky was were affected by his work third hand.  *editing sentences on phones is hard. 
First thing I thought when I read the headline unfortunately :( 
 He's definitely one of those names that should make it through the thickets of history and culture, but will he? Depends largely (as things stand today) on some of the very forces he's spent many years railing against. 
They're working on it I think, it's gonna take some time though to scan all of his notes and everything and upload them 
I disagree with him on plenty, and his blindness with Islam is especially galling, but he predicted the rise of Trump way back in 2010, and he has been calling out 'fake news' at least as far back as his seminal work 'Manufacturing Consent' back in the 80s. He's definitely right about a lot of what makes the U.S. government so dysfunctional, but his prescriptions misunderstand human nature on a very deep level in the same way that most liberals usually do: he mistakes the dysfunction in the U.S. as unique, and uniquely bad, which of course it isn't. The U.S. is *much* better than he gives it credit for, and it couldn't be the utopian country he advocates for* unless people were much better and smarter than they are- and they just aren't. Liberals *always* neglect the Pareto principle.  People are people, and liberals refuse to see that through their sanctimonious virtue signalling.  (*his nonsensical anarcho-syndicalist/Marxist philosophy is just communism by a different name)  
Check r/socialism. I think there are a few posts about the important stuff regarding your inquiry.  
I think that he's just created a different kind of bullshit. But at least it's thought provoking. 
I couldn't disagree more, the man defended the Khmer Rouge. 
A very nice thing about the way Chomsky supports many of his ideas is that he deals greatly in facts, simple facts often unadorned. He can make a statement about why he considers x to be hostile, and proceed to list several instances that back up his claim, revealing hostile acts by x. I think that's a great part of his charm, and a valid approach, specially when coming from someone who insists that the recipient of his message remain critical. After that's done one can go an review the listed events, and try to better understand their context and create their own idea of x acts and decide if the point he was trying to support with those examples holds up or not. Many, though, will just take his word on it and move along; many others will start listing unrelated facts about y that don't directly relate to the subject of x being hostile. 
Chomsky debated Foucault, who did your econ professor debate?  
Will it be understandable for a non student who just wants to know more? 
Given the vast scope of deplorable actions undertaken by the US government in the 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond; I find it hard to believe any damning of said government by Chomsky could be considered disproportionate. 
I'm glad /u/mundotaku has Noam Chomsky all figured out. Great job! 
Thanks, lots of laymen neurologists giving quick summaries, which end up misinforming everyone.    
Humanity will eventually. I believe it's likely to be 10,000 years out versus the mountain of articles and scientists that say it will be within 50 years. I'm 27 and I'm pretty sure the generations before me are still waiting for their flying cars and/or cars that run on water.  
Yes this is what I was thinking.  Unfortunately we can only get a neuron count in the autopsy though as you say! 
It's just interesting that he maintained that awareness without such a large portion of brain.  
It's odd that we'd do that considering how much brain matter is required for just our eyesight to work the way it does. Surely consciousness and thought processes would take more brain matter than just one of our senses right? Yet we still can't find it but we know where to find our eye circuitry. 
The brain is not "you". In fact "you" isn't really located in any one place. The brain is another organ that generally is the processing hub but the body itself is one thing, the brain isn't "you".  
It mentions that he works as a 'civil servant', is married with two children and other sources say he first noticed the weakness in his leg while recreationally bicycling. Seems relatively 'normal', substandard IQ notwithstanding.  
This is the first thing that came to my mind reading this article. Specifically mind uploading... well not exactly mind uploading, more like gradually replacing the brain with electronic components. The main worry for me would be the ability to make sure my consciousness was still me and not just a copy of me. I suppose we can keep our consciousness in tact, if it is done slowly, like this injury. 
The theory that consciousness is a product of the physical brain gets most of its empirical support from the fact that if you change something in the brain, you get a corresponding change in the mind.    With this in mind, instances such as this one, where you drastically change the brain but see little to no change in the mind, have the potential to serve as counter evidence.  
It touches on the mind/body problem and broader phenomenology. The article itself doesn't go too deep, but the implications are pretty apparent.  
One theory is that because the individual in the article became that way gradually, his brain had time to shift functions to parts it still maintained. This is plasticity, but in the case of a small brain from birth, things may be different, but I couldn't say for sure.  
This.  Logic class should be taught at the middle school level after they have decent reading comprehension and core math skills.   
Ethics is mandatory depending on major. I know doctors, nurses, lawyers, engineers, etc. Are required to have an ethics course before they get a degree. Tying ethics to professional action makes alot of sense and is reinforced alot in college. 
I would agree completely with that. Philosophy was actually a subject in school where I grew up, and I remember how increadibly dumb everyone thought it was, I especially loathed Parmenides. We couldnt grasp what the philosophers were trying to communicate, because we would always try to concretise the metaphors instead of thinking about the idea itself. Our prefrontal cortexes werent developed enough. On the tests we just regurgitated the textbook definitions without any grasp of what we were writing.  A few concepts were understandable though, like empiricism and some parts of logic. 
Maybe then they will finally be the generation that will fix the school system.  
Askphilosophy is a better sub. There is little to be found here. 
I hate to say it but I agree. Finance does need to be multiple years. The quality of life for the whole country would improve in a single generation.  I say start with 2 years and let's see what we can get after that. 
Hahaha, yeah tbh is was a bit of a circlejerk inviting title. On the otherhand talking about it might actually make change more likely! Whereas agreeing that we all like cute puppies probably wont change anything :P 
I think we should be doing both things.  A basic financials class is a gaping hole is public school curriculum - balancing accounts, calculating interest, etc.  But knowing logic is critical to learning quite a bit of biology, chemistry and physics.  Understanding formal logic at least a little should help people follow what's happening during experimental design and writing methods sections of reports. 
It's not developmentally appropriate for young children in many cases. 
Math itself is philosophy, in a different form(logic).  Some basic principles are covered when discussing the Scientific Method.  I think in general it comes down to interest.   Kids have so many things in their lives pulling in different directions that to devote enough time in understanding philosophy doesn't happen.  Hell,  look how history is taught and tested.  Most history teachers approach history from a purely factual basis(memorizing dates, events).  Tying different events together doesn't happen. 
nothing encourages children to question the accepted truth then to teach them what to read and how to interpret it.  
Could you care to explain how it would be bastardized? Don't confuse bastardized for simple, if that's what you're thinking. 
Wait... you read Judith Butler at a Christian religious school? I Haven't read a full book from her but I feel her whole gender not inherently existing thing wouldn't jive well with Christian interpretations of gender and such. 
it was my introduction, I read others, but it was the first philosophical book that was able to grab my attention. 
I read this part of the book not long after using a soda can as a shim for the controls on my handlebars. Definitely made me feel proud for figuring it out too. 
That book really sucked me in, one of the handful of books that I felt really made an impact. But what really took me for a ride was the epilogue. I have a sibling with the same condition as his son. 
You meant a lot to that teacher, I hope you appreciate that. 
I have been meaning to write Pirsig and failed to.  This really bums me out.  It's been a few years since I read ZMM and Lila. It's time I give them another go.  
I think it took me three months to finish it. It almost demands that level of introspection, I think. I can't say I enjoyed the book, but I certainly took something from it - a new way of seeing the world, perhaps.  
Loved Lila, but just not as much as Zen. He is willing to show the ugly in Lila though. Brave to do so I think... 
How do you, as a philosopher, look back at the philosophical ideas in this book?  The first time I read it, I was young, and many of the ideas he presents were really thought provoking to me.  The concepts had me rethinking my world view, and had a deep impression on me.  Reading it again as an adult, with more (albeit limited) knowledge of philosophy and life, I saw the flaws in his philosophy, as well as the inherent dangers.    His reductionist cyclical meta-value system, in combination with his mental illness, pushed him over the edge.  To me, his philosophical "trap" is one of the main antagonists of the book. 
It is too bad your pap wasn't more impulsive.  The world might have had another literary masterpiece about two war buddies on a trip to Mexico.. 
I felt it was very annoying. The author tried very hard to intentionally not understand certain things, mostly "quality". Not surprised he went nuts. 
My dad had schizophrenia before he eventually took his life. You think this is a good book for me to read? 
I definitely agree. His metaphysics of quality in Lila really helped me figure out an objective morality as an 18 year amoral idiot.  
I feel like a major theme of the book is that subscribing solely to objectivity or subjectivity leads to your own demise.  The protagonist has suffered a major breakdown wrought by trying to dice the universe into a million pieces. He seems more in touch with reality focusing on the details of one machine, but slowly realizes he can't put his own journey in context without also understanding the other places he's been   
I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction. It's very lengthy and dull to someone who isn't used to the style. But I would recommend it to non-philosophers who like to think about stuff from time to time.  
Having read them both, I think reading Lila before ZMM would be an interesting approach. 
FWIW, I think of it as a real and rather substantial novel.  Whether or not it's substantial philosophy depends on your point of view.  I will say that I've read it at least eight times, and each time it seems like a different book.  Not sure what that means, but it seems like a good thing. 
It seems like about a quarter of this thread (including myself) had to put the book down about halfway through. I wonder if we all made it to roughly the same spot.  
Please be sure you read it. I owned it for years before cracking it open in my mid 20's. I still wish I'd have read it the moment I acquired that first copy. Now I buy as many used copies as I can find when book shopping and give them away to my friends.   It blew the doors off of my reality, and I hope it will yours as well...in a good way. 
Those are the two books I consider the most influential in my personal life, with *Cuckoo's Nest* edging out *ZMM* for top spot.  Mental health aside, they both are wonderful and extremely insightful books about being authentic to one's self, and being mindful. 
Was a great book that seemed to talk right to you.  I know what you mean.  Nice user name btw.  
I forced myself to finish it thinking there was something there because of all the praise.  I didn't get anything out of it. At all.  It's not a great or even good book in my opinion, although it seems from this thread that I'll be in the minority in thinking that.   
My mom loaned me her pink copy. It changed my life, started me on a whole new path towards goals I never knew I had before. I know I'm not your dad, just an anonymous stranger on reddit...but I highly recommend you make that trip. You will not regret it. 
It's better for novices. Accomplished mechanics have already found their zen. So yeah, it's more philosophy and story than motorcycle stuff.  
Just ordered the book zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. It sounds awesome. 
What a delightful surprise. And yet, how unsurprising! 
mental masturbation is a worthless term only used to feel superior to things. if you have a criticism of the book, share it. your comment helped nobody, and similar comments will never teach anything worthwhile, except for an easy way to deride something. 
Ha. And here I am also giving away many copies, of Lila. 
It's funny looking back. I read it knowing absolutely nothing about philosophy. Now I know a little and it dawns on me that he might have tried to combine Plato's ideas of epistemology  (quality is participating in ideal) and Aristoteles' ontology, by way he tried to divide everything to make sense of it.  
*Lila*, Pirsig's second book, is the obvious next choice. But I like warpfield's suggestion of GEB, too. Both will make you think, and GEB is probably timely, given developments in AI. It's decades since I read it, but I suspect it has stood up well. 
it's funny you should ask if it's good. because the idea of 'good' is what it's about. just read the opening quote by phadreaus. 
This is an important question, because I think that a lot of people aren't super clear on what social constructs are. Here's how I was taught to think about it:  1. Natural kind - the category is determined completely by mind-independent, natural properties.  2. Social Construct - the category may be more is less related to mind-independent natural properties, but it is also determined at least a little bit by us. 3. Pure social construct - a type of social construct in which the category is determined completely by us.  On this view, lots of things are social constructs. Races, genders, and species, at the very least. To me, that doesn't seem like a bad thing to recognize. Then, the debate becomes how close or far they are from pure social constructs.   
Read through the comments here. You will see many people arguing that race is really important and a genetic absolute. Citing laughably archaic schools of thought about skull and brain size to justify pseudo racist babble.  
He literally says that it's known for a long time but has to be spoken out loud on a larger scale.  
It was 3 am when saw this and now it's 5 am. I haven't slept but I found the meaning of life. Thanks Reddit 
Watch Jordan Peterson's other videos on nihilism if you want to see him completely dissect and refute it. 
For one, the video is a two hour long static master shot.   Like it or not, there is an abundance of content available today, and audiences must compartmentalize what media they consume. Unfortunately, a two-hour long video of a seminar (that is shot rather dull) is not going to reach a broad audience. 
The comment about computers was about how we don't simply filter existing meaning from what we sense.  We take in data but then we use our consciousness to transform that data into "meaning".  Think of it like a painter, he doesn't get the picture from the paint, he creates a picture using the paint. 
I felt like I was watching a three hour version of some the better scenes in Ghost in the Shell. "blah blah blah well Baudrillard said this blah blah that reminds of a quote from Rossaeu okay cool the Bible said this..." I've seen this kind of thing in fiction and I love it, never thought an unscripted conversation between philosophers like that could be possible and so entertaining. 
There is value in listening to educated people because they have had a long time to think and explore these issues. It does not mean that they are automatically an authority and that you should agree with them, but that you get to be in contact with polished ideas which require a lot of reflection to develop and they can be useful to you if you assimilate them after self reflection and critical thought. Imagine someone spent 20 years thinking about an issue and reaching a very interesting conclusion with which you agree. Why not interchange ideas with such a person and save yourself 20 years of your time? My last example is simplistic but it captures what I'm trying to say. 
Translating between languages can lose nuance and meaning. So can translating the words you actually think into the most common words and speech patterns. Because we're familiar with transforming our thoughts into language, a sentence formulated in a specific way in a specific context can convey ideas that a different sentence that means the same exact thing on the surface does not. I doubt they're using certain words just to look smart. They're trying to be understood by each other with as much accuracy and precision as possible. 
Interestingly enough, Dennis McKenna (Terence's brother, a botonist) was a keynote speaker along side Peterson and Vervaeke at a conference revolving the matters of Mind, Consciousness, and Reality. This year's topic was 'Altered States'. 
Have you tried randomly jumping in the video and finding out for yourself? 
Just type in Jordan B Peterson on youtube, he posts all his UofT and Harvard lectures for free, he also has two TedX talks. 
Sorry for being four months late, but I'm really interested, how would you define 'meaning'? I personally see 'meaning' and 'function' as synonyms 
Can't the meaning of life be anything you make it?? 
mp3juices.cc can do long videos, just tried this one and it works. 
The quality gets better around the three minute mark if you didn't make it that far. skip ahead to see what I mean 
Not for the way they define meaning, a definition that they reach by speculating what one truly wants out of that answer. 
You need to be able to show your meaning to others, and try to understand theirs also. 
The key point:  The Western tradition has tended to abstract out meaning from the World. In fact, we are deeply embodied in the World, structuring our very stance towards the meaning. Grave existential crises are balanced against the need to have projects in the World.  The meaning is *how* to interact, the fitting in with the World. We don't see objects, we see meaning.  See:  Merleau-Ponty  Phenomenology of Perception  Russon The Self and Its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit    
What about efficiency? For example if someone is making a claim that is difficult to immediately verify, and I know that he/she is quite unintelligent and/or uninformed (or he/she has made an overwhelming number of incorrect claims in the past), so I just assume that the new claim is likely false. Basically "all of your previous claims have been false and I know you are not qualified to speak on this topic, so I am going to assume that your new claim is false (unless/until I become aware of evidence to the contrary)." Is this not a good practice to engage in?  
That's big when arguing with climate deniers. I brought it up with a co worker/ Trump supporter yesterday. The first complaint he made was that it had been politicized. I agreed and tried to discuss the science with him. All he would do is repeat Obama says this and Al Gore predicted that and Leonardo DiCaprio is a hypocrite. I just kept saying, "Yeah I'll give you that they're all hypocrites, but that doesn't mean anything about the science!"   No use.  
Right, there's a difference between 'you're a prick so you're wrong' and 'you're wrong because of x reason, and you're also a prick' 
The genetic fallacy is when you evaluate a position based on how likely the source is to know whether that position is true or valid. While technically a fallacy, it is amazingly useful in practice.  The ad hominem fallacy is when you evaluate a position based on irrelevant characteristics of the source. While a fallacy, it can sometimes be useful -- for instance, if someone seems like they're generally deceitful or manipulative, it would be wise to ignore what they say. 
Trump won this because of all of the name calling, and because the left refused to admit their own poop stinks. I've got a big mix of supporters on my social feeds and usually the conversation went like this:  "But the DNC cheated Bernie..." LALALA CANT HEAR YOU  "I have some issues with Hillary's thoughts on..." LALALA WOMAN HATER  "I don't think Trump actually wants to..." RACIST  I think this is less Ad Hominem and more identity politics, really. You're bucketizing people constantly, and then using those buckets to promote your agenda and ignore other people's opinion.  
Except the problem is that when you are talking about ideologies, you can't just say "no that's wrong and you are an idiot for thinking that", because it's all completely subjective, and if you verbally mine away at someone positions without trying to explain why they are (supposedly) wrong, what position *can* they take other than putting their foot down and saying that they are not wrong and not an idiot? By using Ad Hom without refuting the argument, you're far more likely to turn believers into zelots because many feel that they have to double down on their beliefs when those beliefs as well as the content of their very character are under attack.  Even if you don't agree with me, do you honestly think that if I had just responded to you with "fuck you, you are a fucking moron", that would've been better? 
Strawman?  A strawman is when you construct an example that your argument defeats, usually by misrepresenting their argument in some way.  An example would be if someone tells you that we should increase education spending, and your response is to say so that means you want Russia to invade western Europe because we'd have to cut defense spending. 
That is a different form of fallacy called argument ad verecundiam, or argument that is based on authority.  
We do this with a program called VideoScribe, by Sparkol. Great program!  We *did* it because we thought it looked cool. But we now think that *not* doing it looks even cooler.  So we no longer do this. 
Any accusation of racism is by definition an ad hominem attack, if the purpose is to argue against what is being claimed.  A statement is not false purely by virtue of it casting a demographic group in an unfavorable light.    That being said, it is not an ad hominem attack to argue that we shouldn't vote for a candidate who consistently makes unfounded and insulting remarks about large groups of people. 
The ad hominem fallacy is committed when a claim wrongly attacks an opponent, rather than that opponent's argument.  Here, "wrongly" doesn't mean "ineffectively".  A claim wrongly attacks an opponent when the claim doesn't bear on whether the opponent's argument is good or bad.  An ad hominem argument can be effective (persuasive) without bearing on whether the opponent is in fact right or wrong. 
There a common misunderstanding of what the appeal to authority fallacy is. An authority on a topic by its very nature is something we can appeal to to inform us of something that is true. It becomes fallacious when it's not a *valid* authority on the topic discussed.  When debating or discussing a topic, it's perfectly rational to point to the work of authorities in the relevant field. But it becomes a fallacy when you point to a dentist's opinion on genetic research, for example. 
Failing to win an argument and having your opponent refuse to engage in an argument are different things. 
They can be!  There is a fallacy called "ad feminam", which is committed whenever someone argues that a claim must be false *simply because* the person making the claim is a woman.  Similarly, arguing that someone making a claim must be wrong *simply because* they are/aren't X (some gender, race, ethnicity, etc.) is fallacious.  It's worth pointing out that someone's claim *may* be wrong for reasons related to whether they are X.  For instance, it might be that a privileged person's claims about certain marginalized groups are wrong; perhaps this is because the privileged person simply doesn't have access to the facts about what it's like to be marginalized, and so doesn't have an informed view.  In this case the privileged person making the claim is wrong *because*, but not *simply* because, they aren't marginalized 
To be fair,a lot of philosophical thought is pretty esoteric these days. And for the layman, even epistemology gets pretty tortuous the deeper into it you go. It's hard to do if you don't have a serious background in philosophy or a related field. 
I think you overestimate most people's ability to admit and accept when they are wrong.  At least here in the US, it is embedded into our psyche that being wrong is not an option.  Fake it till you make it is a result of this.  But people are faking it so hard, that they've lost touch with reality, and truly believe that they've already made it when they haven't got a clue. 
I agree with the majority of what you said, but coming from an undergraduate majoring in philosophy, my academic cohort has got to be some of the least empathetic, dogmatic, holier-than-thou people I have ever met.   Not saying that all who study philosophy are like that, but rather that empathy and confessing ignorance are not emphasized whatsoever, at least in my department. 
Also the humanities can do this too! If you read a book, instead of writing a book summary, write a book critique. "What was happening at the time the author wrote it? What social events or norms were going on? What greater themes or motifs? What is the moral? What would be different about the book if it were written in this time period rather than that time period? Do you disagree or agree with the author and why?"   Critical thinking isn't exclusive to one class, but a journey's worth of introspection and inquiry.  
Exactly what kind of school are you going to? I have never heard of a school that didn't offer the opportunity to put forward a course plan for approval. Might take longer than just selecting it, but you should consider asking an advisor about options.   But as a political scientist, we have a ton of philosophy, so you might be on to something there. Maybe I should start telling people I have two concentrations.   Overall though, I think that a lack of a doctorate for plain philosophy doesn't herald the end times of free thought. Or just a limitation of your university.  
Why do we need to reject nominalism (and what kind of nominalism)? Also, there are pretty much no Certasians around anymore, so it's basically rejected anyways. 
No, it's a phenomena throughout the western world. In short, it's just yet another wave of reactionism. 
I never want to argue with a philosopher who believes in his own theories. It would be pointless. I've had that discussion with myself before. My theories are logical, backed, and are even evident in day to day life. But I *can not* be certain because I am not all knowing. I became an agnostic early on in life because of that same reason. Science is the same way. It's theory, not fact. Political science is rumor, not truth.  Remember: All it takes is a needle to pop a balloon. 
A number of them seemed like "pure science policy".  All I can envision there is like almost extremist version of all science society.  We need a science tempered society, one where scientific research and evidence isn't undermined, but instead brought to the discussion as one side of the argument...  An it seems some people cash in all their chips into an all science, all empathy, or all business society... that's a bit terrifying. 
Screw that, I'm a practicing scientist and I wish that a requirement for any BS in any science field was one semester of philosophy of science. There were enough contradictory "SCIENCE IS X" claims being spouted out today to make Popper cry. 
Except the scientific definition of a theory is something that's supported by evidence. For example, evolution is "just a theory" but is universally accepted by scientists because of the mountain of evidence supporting it. In science, if something "shows no evidence or experiments" and " has to be taken on face value", it's not a theory. 
Unless they're either god-like or basically Vulcans, let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Basically, for all we know, the aliens aren't perfect either. 
Has Coke used public grants to produce research showing that drinking Coke is fine? Did that happen? 
Exactly. I try to approach people who fear science the same as I would approach a tribe that lived without any contact to civilization. If you tell them their belief is false then you won't win them over, because it would destroy their whole worldview. I try to simply show them the benefits of science, but I introduce them slowly to it so I don't scare them away. 
Hey maybe their just doing side quests and grinding right now. They'll get back to the main quest eventually!  
I remember when I was in primary 2 at school (Not sure of the US equivalent but age wise 5-6) I felt like I was still too little to be a 'big' P2, but felt like I was too 'big' to still be a P1. Kid logic brought me to the conclusion that the only explanation was that I must be dreaming and it's actually the summer break between both years.  
yea my life seems like it would be pretty boring to be simulating.  
Haven't you heard the news? It's made by the universe.  Jk, we use Sparkol's Video Scribe. It's a fantastic program. 
I'm going to butcher the quote and forget the philosopher who said it, but there a good quote that goes some like, "I worry about these thing during the day, but then I go and drink wine and play backgammon with my friends, and I forget about these things and all is well." 
Nope. Certainly there are epistemological issues with trusting the brain. But there are also questions about whether we can trust our "inputs" to the brain. Like the brain in vat connected to a computer that generates our world. In such a situation, how can we prove that we aren't just a brain in a vat? We really can't and hence our "knowledge" isn't real.  
You cannot ascertain that you know that you do not know, you either know that you know  or don't know that you don't know  Know knot known  
Thats because you compare it to being awake and any deviation from the norm shows them they are dreaming, eg having six fingers, not being able to read, etc. If you were in a lucid dream from the day you were born you wouldn't know any different as you have nothing to compare it to.  
I agree with this for the most part. I consider myself a strong "believer" in an argument and sometimes I ponder whether I just want to believe in "god" but maybe I consider "too cool/intelligent (to paraphrase) for mainstream organized religion  
I had this thought as well. Although I didn't know anyone who has ever said something like that so far, it does seem like the most logical conclusion one can draw from thinking. I guess most people just don't think enough... 
I agree with you, even if you somehow got the definitive answer, you wouldn't be able to do anything to change anything about your reality anyway. 
I agree. When tehy said the phrase "knowledge is impossible for humans" i sort of cringed. A better phrase is "everything is basically unknowable." or "its impossible to know anything with absolute certainty" 
Presumably it is only more "real" in so far as you believe it is a memory of an actual event in the "real" world.  This was the idea behind gifting replicants 'false' memories in Blade Runner. 
She doesn't know, that's kind of the point. If you look at everything through a sceptic lense you realize that there is nothing you can know with certainty. Additionally, if you don't know whether or not it is possible to know something for certain, you are still unable to know with certainty. 
Would an entirely apathetic person still be biased though? I mean prior biases could exist but if they really didn't care about whatever those biases pertained to could they really be said to have a bias at all?  
Watched that movie last night. I didn't walk in with any expectations but it was a great film 
Both trial lawyers are biased, but it would be wrong to ignore both of them. It would be wrong to ignore only one of them.  
There is subjective and objective truth. Society goes reckless with subjective lies so subjective truth gets a bad rap to the point where people don't believe it exists at all.  
The post features a couple instances of people saying things like that. 
yup. its not that a biased person is more likely to be wrong, its that a biased person is more likely to have constructed their argument based on their biases and (possibly/often/potentialy) ignoring details not fitting, in line with their biases.  If a media outlet with an anti immigration bias reports on any and all instance of crime committed by immigrants, its not that they are wrong about the crimes committed, they just have certain reasons for why they call attention to this. 
The evidence *and* the logical inferences we make from the evidence. But yeah. 
Correlation, in the majority of cases isn't accompanied by causation ;-) so I don't know how about your claim.   You can find Correlation very easily between totally unrelated things while a causal dependency must be proven.  
Next Up on philosophy for dummies: Why logically valid arguments are important. 
Not would...might.  Again, bias makes it less likely than an opinion is correct, but it doesn't preclude the opinion being correct. 
You mean, you're not connected to all your high school friends on Facebook? What else is Facebook for other than passive-aggressively sharing stuff like this on Facebook? ;) 
But the latter case depends on whether the bias is relevant to what they are saying. E.g., if they are simply stating a fact, then their bias doesn't *necessarily* matter.   E.g., "They're biased (toward a Keynesian view of economics) so their claim (that the unemployment rate is what the BLS says it is) is unreliable" might still be fallacious. It's not clear that being biased towards Keynesian economic theory bears on whether the BLS is reporting accurate unemployment numbers.  
Exactly. The doctor who tells you to lose weight while being overweight himself; he's a hypocrite, but he's not wrong. If the doctor tells you to take some drug, and he's been funded by the drug manufacturer, he's very biased, but *it still may be the best drug for you*.   Bias and hypocrisy increase the probability someone's opinion may be wrong, but it is not evidence by itself. 
Sure, we should only *conclusively* dismiss an argument if it can be demonstrated to be wrong, but it is perfectly reasonable to never entertain it in the first place if there's not a reasonably reliable source for it.   I'm sorry, but not only is somebody citing Breitbart not going to convince me, it's going to make me think less of them as a person and all their other arguments as well.  
But even if a source is biased, it doesn't *necessarily* follow that all of their claims are false. 
Have you ever met an unbiased person?   I'm not going to bother getting into a conversation about something I don't care about.. 
That is far from being a uncontroversial statement friend. Information can be factually wrong and useless (Swedish people call trees "gufulfilfs"), it can be factually wrong and useful (I have a pet koala that will kill you if you break into my house), it can be factually correct but useless (rubber tastes like rubber) or it can be factually correct and useful (ice is frozen water). Factual truth and utility are two different ways to measure information. There are plenty of other ways you could measure it as well. (Word count, areas of relevance, etc.). It is a bit silly to suggest that information exists along only one axis. 
Agreed. That's actually pretty close to what I say in section 5. 
1) Sorry. Reddit broke the site for awhile. It's working now.  2) I used the name for the sake of efficiency and clarity. "The bias fallacy" is much shorter than "those ad hominem dismissers that object to a claim by citing bias." And to call it simply "ad hominem" would be misleading. The bias fallacy is a *subset* of ad hominem fallacies. Not all ad hominem arguments are about bias.   3) I had no idea this would get so much attention. I actually expected it to be ignored. In my experience, people do not argue in ways that indicate that they're super interested in learning about how to avoid reasoning errors. That's kind of why I wrote it. I was sick of hearing/reading the fallacy. I thought it needed to be said. But, again, I didn't expect that anyone *wanted* to hear it. 
But not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases improve accuracy.   
Fair point.   But we should keep in mind that not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases *improve* accuracy.   
Sounds like you're assuming that all biases decrease accuracy. That's not the case. Some biases improve accuracy. Section 3 explains. 
Sounds like you're assuming that all biases decrease accuracy. That's not the case. Some biases improve accuracy. Section 3 explains.  
Sounds like you're assuming that all biases *decrease* accuracy. That's not the case. Some biases *improve* accuracy. 
Let's grant that it's a *subset* of ad hominem. Just because one thing is a subset of another thing doesn't mean that the subset doesn't exist.  
Not necessarily. Some biases actually improve accuracy. 
That or a genetic fallacy. And some have pointed out (in the Reddit comments) that it could actually be a formal fallacy.  
But not all biases decrease accuracy. Some biases improve accuracy. 
Not all biases skew that way. Some biases improve overall accuracy. Section 3 of the post explains. 
I see your point, but even that that latter heuristic is, strictly speaking, fallacious. One can report something that conflicts with one's biases and still be wrong.  The former heuristic is a bit better. Perhaps that's why you put it first. 
Fair point. Withholding relevant facts is a bias that might make it more likely that one is wrong. But even that bias wouldn't *necessarily* result in being wrong.   A fine distinction, but a distinction nonetheless. 
But surely not all false claims *necessarily* imply bias. In principle an unbiased person (if there is such a thing), could make an error and thereby be wrong about something.  
And some biases can *improve* credibility. Section 3 of the post explains. 
This. Where I live (Argentina) we are taught philosophy in highschool and we don't have a 'better society'  
"I can't go to the bathroom or go on my phone whenever I want, so I'm not free" 
Exactly what I wanted to say. Moreover, it's awfully taught: you can't really debate because the teacher has a program to cover and not much time. So you end up with a course considered as really boring by most pupils. 
Come to think of it, aristocracy is a *really* good idea! 
Yup. Logic and critical thinking would be a much more helpful place to start. 
Holy crap I didn't realize it was robotic at first. I spent 20 seconds trying to understand why they picked such a boring british voice actor to do this video. 
Your parents are supposed to teach you most of that shit. 
There is in terms of making decisions, individual or legislative mandates/prohibitions. And the nature of production flows from those decisions. 
This is really not true of a lot of schools. There are plenty of shitty high schools but the fact that you went to one doesn't mean everyone does. My high school was very open to discussion in most classes, I took several religious studies classes in high school and the majority of lecture time was spent in discussion. 
I think regardless of what philosophy is being taught, the point of the class shouldn't be to have students adopt whatever ideas they're learning and rather examine them and make their own decisions. A good class on Marxism shouldn't produce a batch of Marxists 
Not at all true in the US. Most students never have a class in philosophy even through college. 
Today's conservatives, whose worldview demands simple non-negotiable realities and/or religious obedience, would find it threatening on an even deeper level.  
The thing about the AI is that there probably will not be an AI with human-level intelligence. I think there's a general consensus, that once it reaches human level, it will very quickly (in the matter of hours to months) become super-human. 
You're assuming we understand it. AI will get to a point where it will understand itself and we can't, that's the point of super intelligent AI.  The question is, what is the super intelligent thing to do with the universe, and especially humans? Is it to ruthlessly eliminate waste to improve efficiency, which would lead an AI to exterminate Humans (and other "lesser" intelligence)? Or is it that seeing different view points is mutually beneficial, even for Super intelligent beings? At what point is our intelligence essentially worthless, and incapable of adding value to the universe? 
As someone who was bad at public speaking, and has become less bad at public speaking, it's like anything: practice makes perfect.  You work out a neat little arsenal of one liners, self deprecation, ways to sound genuine, humorous ways to deal with hecklers etc. - neat, flexible little tools that you can shoehorn into just about any situation. You learn how to read the mood of a crowd before you get up there. You understand how to think on your feet and lessen your need to rely on notes (which can be awfully wooden). You enunciate better. You know that your brain has a way of always twisting a crowd's reaction to make it seem worse.  Plus, like a funny comedian, Musk now has the advantage of genuinely being fascinating. People are ready to hang from his words before he even opens his mouth. And he's smart enough to not take that for granted. 
It's not a predefined thing that is bound to happen in a certain way. Sure, we can't know exactly what might happen, but there could still be a million different singularities. And those are defined by the design choices we make now. Intelligence isn't some ethereal thing. It has form and context and when it manifests it manifests in a certain way. It's not like we're tapping into some magic power. 
A lot of AI projects focused on very narrow areas.  AGI is an attempt to refocus people on intelligence that will work for anything, rather than super human performance at a particular domain.    For example, we have better than human performance at chess, Go, and Strategic Air Campaigns.  AGI is the demand that we build a machine that can solve all domains, rather than just one specialized area.  
I personally find this to be a fine example of philosophical discussion. But that's just me. 
When we can empathize with the creation. Our ability to empathize with the A.I will change how we feel about terminating it.  
I would actually like to hear more from Demis Hassabis. In this panel, he has the most practical experience working on AIs. 
You should read the book "Last Chance in Texas: The Redemption of Criminal Youth" by John Hubner. This wonderful piece gives the true account of several children going through the Giddings State School, which is a juvenile correctional facility in Lee County, Texas for the most violent offenders (25+ year sentences). What is special about this "school" is their approach to rehabilitation. They utilize very effective psychoanalytic techniques to reform these kids and teach them how to empathize with other people and conform to society. 90% of people who successfully make it through the program at Giddings State School will not reoffend. Hubner does a fantastic job depicting these children and the horrific experiences which drove them to commit such heinous crimes. 10/10, would recommend.  
I'm no expert on violent criminals, but I was under the impression that a LARGE majority of them are poorly educated and rarely reflect on their actions (nurtured sociopaths by virtue of their environment rather than their intrinsic nature).  Ethics is a phenomenal way to encourage self-reflection because it's all 100% applicable to our own internalized morality and as such - highly relatable. I'm not claiming this will make a bunch of pacifists out of everyone but the goal of prison should always be rehabilitation - and I think such a "treatment" would be moderately efficable for a modest cost. Why not?  If anything we develop killers with a code that are easier to manipulate and predict per your first paragraph :) 
How anyone could oppose teaching violent criminals ethics will forever be beyond me. 
I'm guessing you didn't read the piece. *She* has been doing this for years, and reports very positive experiences. (And she's worked with at least some people who come from supermax, too.) 
Arguably, any sources you can find online are now "education for free". Vast numbers of philosophical texts are in the public domain, too.  So...you *are* fine with it? 
There's nothing metaphysical about life - its a matter based system that maintains internal equilibrium and reproduces. 
There might not be a change in chemical composition on death, but isn't there a significant change in the more abstract 'composition' that is the electrical activity in the brain? If the neural connectome of the human brain gives rise to feelings, ideas, consciousness, etc., perhaps the definition of 'life' (and therefore 'death') should be partly based on that, rather (or alongside) chemical composition.  
We are in the process of building gods. The first truly AGI (artificial general intelligence) will be smarter than us by a billionfold.  
It is a good question and not answered well. It is not at all clear what "on this date" means. As you said, we have had calendar changes. Is "the day after Valentine's Day" a date? That is, do we look at some ritual and try to connect it to some ritual now? Or do we connect that ritual to the Sun or the Moon? What if there is more than one ritual involved and they deal with different time scales?   I don't think there is really a sensible answer. It was in mid winter is probably the best  we can say.  
I believe Socrates was expected to *request* exile as an alternative punishment to death, but refused to offer an alternative. 
I feel like swapping crito for symposium would work better if you're going for a theme. 
Read Plato and let Socrates emerge that way. It's hard, but you'll get more out of it if you let the dialogues speak for themselves.  
This isnt really true at all.  If anything, Socrates was lumped in with the Sophists until Plato, the only difference being that he was home-grown.  It's also not fair to cast the Sophists as merely rhetoriticians.  They had some very innovative and interesting ideas, and much of their work was questioning the "givens" of religion and society. 
He didn't present his death as for his own self, though. The very reason he refused to flee was for his love of his city-state and their laws: if his city commanded him to die, he would die. 
I believe that virtually all historians agree that he did indeed exist. However, most of what we know is from Plato, so we can't exactly say if he's tampered with the things that Socrates said and philosophised.  
I once saw a cuddlefish at an aquarium in chatanooga and he looked like the most pissed off animal I have ever seen. He had a very human look in his eye that said "I would fucking kill you if I could." As his skin flashed very intimidating colors at me. 
If they're so smart why don't they just figure out how to live longer?? 
Of course, if an alien species has the concept of a "spaceship" that it can use to travel here, we already have some common basis for understanding, unlike with the other more intelligent species on Earth.   Cephalopods are also a good example of how an alien intelligence doesn't have to be automatically hostile to humanity, unlike many people seem to imagine. Even large ones typically seem curious rather than hostile when they encounter humans.  
That's when you have to impose your own standards. 
Eh, I mean as long as the genetic modifications are not released into the wild it's not going to disrupt any ecosystems.  One could certainly argue from a utilitarian standpoint that the results of keeping a society of artificially enhanced cephalopods for the purpose of study might lead to a more harmonious existence with nonhuman (potentially extraterrestrial) intelligence. 
Thing is that time is relative. This seems like a short lifespan for us, but does it to them?  
Terrible moderation.   You can't go around deleting posts with 800 upvotes and 40 comments. At that point you are wasting everyone's time more than any off topic discussion ever could. 
I bet you could teach one to put on a little helmet and walk around out of its tank for long periods. 
Remember, in those kind of works of fiction, the Old Gods are always stopped (no matter what kind of hero stops them) and bad things happen to those who were in favor of their rise 
You may be wrong, my friend. The best (and scientifically verified) way to increase the lifespan of a man is to remove his sexuality. The sooner, the better. That is one reason women live at least 12 years more than men.  
I couldn't agree more. When I was in high school we had a few short seminars on philosophy to see if it suited our transitional year curriculum. Unfortunately it ended up just being another religion class, as the teacher was very religious and couldn't drop her preconceived biases. I ended up losing a lot of interest in the subject after that. 
I agree. I had rhetoric in high school and found it immensely helpful. Was blown away by logic in college, and wished I'd had some exposure to it in high school as well. I think rhetoric, logic, and ethics should be mandatory. Would love to see them taught in early education but I'm not entirely sure what that would look like.  
Religion is philosophy, a "special" type of philosophy, where the existence of God is an non-negotiable truth / un-questionable axiom and as such all logic arguments are just more inventive ways of circular reasoning because all truths must always and ultimately lead back to God. That circularity is the measure of the arguments soundness. 
I'm skeptical that the "philosophy" they'd like to teach isn't simply the politics of whatever ruling party develops the curriculum 
Ok then, no applying for philosophy PhD in the US. Don't see this problem much in UK uni's, at least my old one. Applying to French Unis now and they seem to be alive and kicking. 
disagree. the subject matter may overlap, but the approach and methodology of philosophy is very different and very vital.  
The English have never produced any great philosophers (speaking as an Englishman and a philosophy grad). Locke was most interesting for a mistake about primary and secondary qualities. He and Hobbes and JS Mill made some useful interventions on political theory, but that's about it.   This lack of interest in the subject explains why the English are incapable of questioning received wisdom.   They slavishly do what they're told by "experts", who almost always are nothing of the sort, but rather public-school-and-Oxbridge-types who have no independent thought process and who just spout whatever they read in The Economist.  Brexit was a rare and amazing exception to this rule. The howls of rage from the aforementioned Establishment are something to behold...   
And it's something that is taken for granted lots as well! 
The reason for this is because school is not just about academic and physical education but about socialization as well. In the real world you always have to work with other people to some degree, and your first "group project" shouldn't be when you're 18 and at your first job.  
If it were indoctrination then it would matter but in Philosophy you deconstruct models of the world so you can build and edit your very own.  It is in many respects the opposite of indoctrination, which can be painful to learn and also threatening to those in power. 
Why would you need a doctoral? Just start creating philosophy education programs 
The problem is that book is largely simply made up. The authors literally say this in the endnotes.  
People desire to be rich, adored, powerful, and to bully other people when in need of excitement to alleviate their boredom.  
Four should be Fornicate, just to keep the alliteration alive. 
Surely that's aquisitiveness?   Also, he credited the desire for power as the main driver behind all of human progress and civilisation. I'd say that's pretty positive. 
Russell didn't "propose a formula of human psychology," some clickbait pseudo-journalist edited a speech of his and put a misleading headline on it to make it seem that way.  FAKE NEWS.  Seriously, read Russell's speech (titled "What Desires Are Politically Important?") 
Nope, the original title was "What desires are politically important?"   The (very deceptive) clickbait title was added in the clickbait era.   
The title of this speech was "What desires are politically important?"   
Love of power, I guess. You're blinded, and thus powerless, when gazing at the sun. 
No Country for Old Philosopher-Kings, by Plato McCarthy 
Neither Plato nor Socrates necessarily believed all this literally. The point of the dialogue format is that it's multivalent and invites people to think about multiple perspectives rather than authoritatively proclaiming a Truth. 
Plato puts aristocracy in the best of light, then timocracy and so on.  
Just to be a devil's advocate, can you provide proof that he is wrong?  Edit-It's one of life's great ironies that we have 3,000 years of civilization to look back upon and gain insight from along with the availability of almost any amount of information you could desire at our fingertips and we are actually the most ill-informed and easily fooled than we have ever been. 
If someone can tl;dr Plato, and still keep all of the necessary information intact, they'd deserve a literary medal. 
That's a narrow view.  Both major parties are *clearly* not monolithic, and there are varying degrees of tyrannical behavior and ideals in each, most of the time Id argue very little (and Im pretty cynical about U.S. govt./politics in general).  I dont mean to sound condescending but you should really explore what true tyranny looks like, because it has existed and was far past what the U.S. experiences now. 
Popper is great.  His whole tussle with Wittengstein is an interesting footnote in the history of philosophy. 
Every society has a system for getting things done. What makes a society stable is that the system is honored and respected by everyone. This could be a hierarchy of nobles, a theocracy of scholars, or our own system of elected officials, among others.  His complaint is that democracy tends towards the disrespect and thus collapse of the system. The ends become more important than the means and whoever has power grabs madly at wealth and more power because they have no assurance that the means will protect them when they leave power.  The point where it becomes an out-and-out tyranny is when the last leader tosses out the system altogether. He'll either believe or use the belief that the other side is even worse to justify this act and the respect for the system will have atrophied to the point where there will be little principled objection. 
I kind of wonder if it even matters. The material for tyranny is here  regardless of who ended up winning the election. That I think is part of the point Plato is making. Tyranny isn't one person holding an entire nation hostage and putting him or herself in charge. In a way the tyrant is as much a victim as anyone else, or even more so according to Plato.  If the U.S. degrades soon, I could see it as a result of conservative leaders demonizing liberals, and liberal leaders demonizing conservatives. No one is being held accountable because it looks like partisanship, and conservatives hate their leaders but see them as their last hope, and liberals hate their leaders but see them as their last hope. 
maybe let the bottom fall out and try to reconstruct it in a better fashion? 
bah, the student would probably just read it to pass and secretly hate it unless he already likes philosophy or a professor who knows how to teach it in a way the student understands  
It does.  It shows how the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor and the elevation of slaves to citizens is how a tyrant buys popular power.  If you don't want tyranny to come from democracy you need to limit wealth redistribution. 
That's what authoritarians do.  They want you to believe that they're the only one who can fix all of the problems so that you have to listen to what they say and trust in them and only them. 
I don't think anyone is interested in your summary.  I'm wondering what value this judgement has.  This guy has been dead for a while and his works speak for them-self.  What need is there to try and demonize or aggrandize him, rather than just critically analyze his work. 
I had my niece and nephew over today,  my wife took them to church because their mother won't let us have them over unless we take them to church.  When they got home they were telling my wife all the things you need to do to go to heaven,  after their list I asked how they knew that was true and they just stared at me dumbfounded  like they're not used to beliefs being questioned. This article is exactly what I've been looking for.  
Please tell me you followed up with "and how would you test that hypothesis"-type questions instead of teaching her that made up facts are the same as tested theories.  
Books like Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder are great for pre/early teens and upwards, and I'm sure there are lots of other books on philosophy that make the subject accessible to pretty much any audience you want. But I agree with you, it needs to be taught by a Philosophy specialist like any other distinct subject, and not like an oddly specific history lesson or off shoot of English. Arguably it has more to do with science then any other subject. 
Yup. Philosophers are behind the greatest movements in history.  
You make an important point; I'm a Neuroscience student and one of the first things you learn in any research oriented program is that constructing a manuscript is a daunting task. You don't just slap on pretty figures and statistics for submission. The level of reasoning that needs to be applied to make sure your conclusions and interpretation of the results are justified is comparable to that applied in Philosophy (at least that's what I've gathered from discussions with my Philosophy Professor). Of course, not all philosophers are cut from the same cloth, as with scientists. These skills are not exclusive to either discipline, and not every one you meet will have them. What needs to be done is increase the amount of those educators that do instill these skills into their students: STEM, Philosophy, or otherwise.  
A life raft isn't a cureall when you're stranded in the middle of the ocean, but without one you will certainly drown. 
Maybe this points out the validity of an earlier poster, that may be we as a society want or value critical thinkers. Revolutionaries are dangerous people. We want people to have the ability of read, write and be numerate, but maybe not much beyond that. Even those who study a STEM subject, how many really think about what they are learning and just act as sponge because that is more economically prudent thing to do. 
Teach Theory of Knowledge to International Baccalaureate students. 
"If we keep treating children as if they're dumb" ... "Adults can easily understand metaphors, children might take things literally."   Is this a flawed argument? I'd say: Protect children from the world, as is the job of a parent. But weigh the consequences of fantasy vs reality. Not experiencing the happiness from santa vs living the lie until you're a bit older. Are these fantasies always harmful or sometimes beautiful? Does a kid really need to know all of the horrors that early? 
You mean not as easily manipulated.  Advertising still works even if you know how it works.  Placebos work, even when you know it's a placebo.  We were all born with all the basic instincts, emotions and general wiring of the evolution branch we evolved on. 
Ignorance is bliss. I learned that at age 20 after watching some of those clips from the Middle East. People refuse to believe what'd right in front of them.  
children can be capable of concrete operational thought 
Cause it's pretty easily to connect everything to existentialism 
That's not what is being suggested as the story arc. OP proposes that the character arc of Rick is developing a way to be happy even while knowing nothing matters, without retreating to some false meaning.  
IIRC the end of that essay is "one might imagine Sisyphus happy." which doesn't necessarily mean he's found meaning, it could be interpreted that he has reached a state of acceptance of the absurd and revels in the meaningless turmoil of life. 
It's not, it's content fluff filler. They invented a narrative around an advertisement.  
I think you nailed why I like Rick & Morty so much, by comparing it to my favorite philosopher. 
Hahahah I can attest, watched the series 3x through and it has challenged my philosophical tendencies each watch through lol 
Do you really think so? I just looked at their channel page and in the last six months they made about ~45 Videos, 5 of which were about R&M.  I would hardly call that 'the only thing they do'. 
Don't forget the Morty Mind Shield - THE reason why all the Ricks have Mortys with them. 
While I've always had an interest in philosophy, I really began investing time researching varying schools of philosophical thought following my transition from religion to atheism. From there, I spent a great deal of time researching a multitude of religious/philosophical beliefs, particularly by way of thinkers like Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris. Admittedly, my knowledge regarding religious convictions is greater in comparison to my philosophical wisdom, but I have attempted to accumulate as much information as I can and am always seeking to learn more as the quest for knowledge is never complete! 
He embraced Nihilism the same way a doctor embraces illness.  If they said Active Nihilism or "Overcoming Nihilism" it would be more accurate, but still, so silly. 
Two questions.     1.  What are your alternatives to a world with no purpose? It's not like we have definite proof what your purpose should be. You either have to find your own purpose or believe what someone else tells you your purpose is. There are no other options.     2. Why does the origin of your purpose even matter? You exist.  Leave the world a better place and enjoy the time you have here.  Find what makes you happy and how you can contribute to our world and do that.   
The Web is the best place to learn about and discuss our existence from a philosophical perspective, in my opinion. I haven't found anyone in-person who has had an existential crisis. Probably because a lot of people are religious. 
Is that so bad ? Nietzsche may not have been a nihilist; but nihilism was certainly a very important topic to him.  You can play the edgy philisopher all you want, but there are enough litterature about Nietzsche being linked to nihilism that both his wand nihilism page mentions him as being a key philosopher for that specific school of thought. 
This raised a question in my mind: should we interpret that freedom as altruism?  
It probably will once they put out a few more sub par videos.  
Watching those two guys sculpt each other was pretty good, too, but this one might have more lasting effect. My college English professor suggested to me that I am an existentialist, and given what I knew about it at the time I disagreed. But after this video, it might actually be a suitable description.  
The problem isn't that there is little depth in Crash Course videos. The problem is that they often say things which are outright false. 
As someone who has been studying philosophy at university for quiet some time I can confirm that they are fairly inaccurate. They dumb-down subjects, which could have two reasons: for the less informed public, or they do not understand it themselves. I think both are equally true. Regardless, if you wish to truly understand it, check some introductory second-literature and then read the original. That's the only way to truly understand, and even then it is a difficult task. But remember, those people spends their entire lives on these subjects, so just trying to understand what they meant in a few minutes is not just impossible, it is blatantly arrogant.   
I would argue that Sartre's view is off because he supposed that we do not have a human nature. Modern genetics has taught us a lot about behaviors that are inherited from our parents, so his argument there doesn't exactly hold up.   He also likes to use Freudian psychology, which is outdated. 
Why do you think the greens are generally disliked on reddit? Genuinely interested.  
One of my professors told this story in class.. I believe he went to war 
I think precisely the same, my personal observation is that they are trying to express the simplicity and emotion of this... psychological/philosophical thinking.  
I think that's where Sartre gets it a bit wrong: that we have no human nature. However, even with our external influences still being very powerful, we still are ultimately choose each and every one of our actions, and no one can actually force us to do anything. 
As is the case for all Turkish classes. In Literature class, the exams outright ask us "what are the 5 attributes of this very specific type of ottoman poetry" and the university entrance exam mostly consists of "from which writer's book was this exerpt taken from?"  We need a major rehaul. 
One semester (or year) of English. There's already four years of that in high schoool (at least where I'm at). And all the most critically important skills from English class carry *directly* over into philosophy.  I can personally confirm that one Intro to Ethics class made me a far better reader and writer than sitting through yet another semester of Shakespeare. 
To be fair, a VHS tape of a pineapple talking about kantian metaphysics couldn't make it any *more* impenetrable. 
My thought exactly. I learned my logic from being a "math" kid. Philosophy is a great for things like forming arguments, but things the American public deem more important can teach that just as well (history, english) 
This is why my father wanted to send me to private school; they had a logic class taught by a philosophy PhD. I think that you have a good point, and perhaps this should be a parent's responsibility. All you really need is a book and someone to talk to about it.  
Schools are struggling in the US just to graduate kids that can read and write, much less do math. Get real, indeed :( 
I totally agree, and I get the impression your students are lucky to have you. The shame of it is, from my experience training or observing teachers across a range of subjects this is not a common approach for various reasons - so formalising such skills (in an above reply I've suggested these are critical thinking skills as opposed to 'philosophy') in some way may be the only way to ensure it's something that can filter into the mainstream rather than being a fortunate bonus for certain kids in certain classes (not necessarily as a separate course though... perhaps in a cross-curricular manner or embedded in some of the achievement criteria as a more obvious way of linking these to a syllabus's "vision" or "mission" of whatever, which are often otherwise pretty arbitrary and easy to completely ignore when you're not in a meeting with the principal).  
Also the example is wrong.  Of course illegial aliens take jobs from American citizens. 
Yep, philosophy doesn't have any effect on most of the students even if mandatory  
"What is the task of all higher education?" To turn men into machines.   "What are the means?" Man must learn to be bored.   "How is that accomplished?" By means of the concept of duty.   "Who serves as the model?" The philologist: he teaches grinding.   "Who is the perfect man?" The civil servant.   "Which philosophy offers the highest formula for the civil servant?" Kant's: the civil servant as a thing-in-itself raised up to be judge over the civil servant as phenomenon. ~Nietzsche 
I'm confused.   I had a few mandatory philosophy course (mandatory here to have most degree after high school). The introduction course WAS essentially a course on rational discourse and logic. With some Plato and Lucrece thrown in.   So isn't that just a specialized philosophy course? (Though I guess everything is :P). It seems like the obvious starting point too.  
Hm, I didn't think of that. I'll look more into that later and might change my opinion to 6-12.   Do you think there is a way you could "plant the seeds" at a younger age though? 
Hell Yeah! But start the course off with some proper standing up arcade stuff - these kids have gotta learn some respect for history.  
I could also easily see a teacher deciding to push their own personal beliefs/agenda along kids. Maybe the teacher decides to emphasis god because they believe god is real, or vise versa.  Lots of ways this could go bad.   I think an argumentation class would be good. Something like speech and debate, but less about writing essays. 
logic, reasoning, and critical thinking is all present in other fields. 
This inevitably happens to all "school subjects", especially those that correspond to a state testing regime. 
Math classes usually don't teach formal logic. And social studies is hardly a substitute for ethics. 
Learning about some schmuck's opinions helps you to reason? UM No! That's like saying reading the bible will make you smarter. 
Username does not check out  Unless oxen are some real cynical bastards 
Thank you haha you're comment made sense to me. The characters on Sunny are psuedo-escapists, they make their lives miserable and then spend all their time getting drunk with each other in their bar to try and forget. I'm not quite sure how the OP arrived at the conclusion that we should take a page out of Sunny's book to be more happy, but I would bet that OP has his own psuedo-escapism tendencies and used the show as justification.     "If happiness is subjective, then I can make myself believe that these people are happy doing what they know they shouldnt , and I can be happy doing what I know I shouldn't."     Sure they smile sometimes and have fun together, but are they fulfilled in any meaningful way? No.   
To me that seems like absolutely valid/sound logic.  I guess I enjoyed the video for different reasons.  I read a book recently, Philosophy in Film by Mary Litch.  She proposed that film/tv can and should be used as a springboard for philosophical questions/propositions.  As a teacher, I'm happy to see the trend in video essays like these that explain ideas from multiple disciplines (Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, etc.) Anything that makes academia accessible to a wide audience is brilliant to me.   
thats not how i saw it at all.  I read a book, Philosophy Through Film by Mary Litch, where she absolutely persuaded me that film/tv can and should be used as a *springboard* for examining philosophical questions.  The keyword here is *springboard*.  I didn't see the video as an attempt at exposing a deeper meaning in the screenwriting,  I just saw it as an interesting attempt at making philosophy relevant and accessible to a wider audience than just philosophy students and professors.  
I agree with you. The person who's going to find value in it is going to be a Christian deontologist with very little background in moral philosophy. 
It sounds like you're describing Stockholm Syndrome. 
This seems like a fair question. I would assume that torture involves an inability for the tortured to escape from the actions being placed on them. In fact, I guess it doesn't even have to be actions upon them, you could torture them by attacking their family in some way for instance. Do we count prison as torture? I guess it certainly can be. Can I accidentally torture someone? Not so sure about that.  As such, I guess my first go at a definition of what it means to torture someone would be to purposely and successfully inflict physical and/or psychological damage onto someone with the desire and the attempt to make sure that the person has no means to escape continuous damage other than your own will to let them go. 
It isn't different. Leave aside the morality question, you don't know if they are a terrorist unless convicts by 12 jurors. The constitution prevents extra judicial punishment of people whether they are terrorist or witches or communists. Everyone is fair gave when you don't prove guilt first.  
In my view, torture is next-level prolonged suffering as a form of punishment, and/or cruel and unusual forms of execution (popular in medieval times). Like being broken on the wheel, boiled/burned alive, or crucified... Sometimes those events took hours, or even days to kill someone - not quick, or dare I say, humane like electrocution or lethal injection.   Nobody (in their right mind) is going to volunteer for that. I think we're hard-wired with a sense of self-preservation that wouldn't allow it. 
I love your insight.   If the West was to resort to depriving a high value prisoner of their sleep to extract information that could save lives, don't you think that would send a message to countries such as China/DPRK/ as well as the organizations the West was fighting, saying that the morality of torture is more subjective than we claim? 
What would they say? Is it effective or is it not? 
Pretty much, you cant. There will always be a hypothetical situation that justifies almost any action. But in reality there will most likely never be one man with the knowledge to save an entire race, who will only divulge the necessary information if you torture him.  Personally I think torture should be avoided at almost all costs, but in your hypothetical or similar situations, the choice is obvious. I dont think humanity or the world benefits from looking at things without a completely open mind, even about something as awful as torture. There are too many factors to consider in all decisons to ever say it can only be '*this*' way. 
Police would likely be far more effective in preventing/prosecuting crime if they had CCTV cameras in every room in every person's house, but any reasonable person would find that gain irrelevant compared to the intangible value of privacy.  The same argument can be put forth here. 
Well the argument against nuts in a vice is that a captive will say anything at that point to avoid further torture. IIRC there have been studies done on this that conclude that information gathered during torture is generally inaccurate. 
I could imagine an ISIS sympathizer making this exact same post. You think they are just crazy animals slaughtering human beings for Allah. In reality, they are retaliating. Avenging their dead and lost. Just like we retaliate and avenge our dead and lost.   I am not equivocating you with a terrorist, but rather inviting you to take another look at your rhetoric and see it for what it is. 
But people are too stupid / have the wrong perspective. 
How so? Just because you're allowed to kill people under certain circumstances doesn't mean that you can torture them, just like how killing combatants in battle is different from killing prisoners.   
And then they starting fighting to the death, killing more cops and solders, to avoid being tortured. 
bring on the lab grown meat.  If it costs the same and tastes the same, Im totally down for it.  Im sure the "real thing" will remain highly sought after as a status symbol. 
Though I completely agree with you for today. What about when we are capable of making all of those produce items in a lab with no death. I am all for hunting but only if you are going to eat it. If you could go get venison for the same price would it not be cruel to go hunting for simply the sport? 
Then people will complain only the rich can afford to eat meat, while the poor become malnourished. And if the tax is high enough, you will create a black market in meat just as with other goods in demand.  
I see what you're saying, but I disagree.  Killing and eating animals isn't a problem...if it is necessary for your survival.  Our society affords us ease of access to all foods, so it is hard to see the moral side of killing any animal for food these days.  It isn't necessary for our species to survive. 
But what you gotta think about is, what is our definition of cruelty, is it species based, life based, intelligence based?  wikipedia says "behaviour which causes physical or mental harm" and killing causes physical and mental harm, whether it is yourself, or other people around you. If you saw someone die around you, you'd suddenly get shook and scared. Its the same for the animals. 
we absolutely can do things which will make sense in the future. much of what we call civilization is in actuality the machinery which we use to do those kinds of things, like plant vineyards and educate children. 
I like your style. In some less developed countries the communities have erected huge contraptions (basically a large funnel with a spotlight on top) to trap and collect grasshoppers and other insects that they later fry and eat for an incredibly cheap source of protein. I can't see the downside to this.  
I took discrete mathematics in school. It blew my mind for the first 3 weeks and then it became so fun and interesting. We would use it in class to analyze controversial statements. I've never used it since though :/ 
a valid argument is obviously not necessarily true, but a valid argument is a tool you can use to determine truth, if your argument is valid, and your premises are true your conclusion will necessarily be true aswell, and invalid argument can't be used to determine if anything is true or not 
My thoughts exactly, I don't get why would anyone do this. 
Geometry no. But we did have basics of discrete math in high school. 
Nope, I watched the entire thing and I'm still none the wiser. It would be interesting to see a video that explains how this works fully though, I'm sure I could start to understand it fairly quickly.  My main issue was that she glossed over why so many of them "don't matter, they are true" when there was an F in the column she was referencing. But then that's not what this video is for so that's fair enough. 
I'm sure it's hard for you to imagine HAVING friends 
It's about understanding how to use a truth table, not about the logistics of drinking coffee, I don't get what your problem is. 
You can't charge tens of thousands of dollars or take out student loans for a degree on common sense so no.  
You can set up truth tables for multiple propositions at once, and then test for validity by looking for counterexamples. So truth tables can in fact be used to determine whether an argument is valid. 
Yes there is an errounous assumption that Machiavelli advocated dictatorship but as I understand it he was for a republic. 
His conclusion doesn't really answer the question he asks either, "what makes a good ruler? ... Pay attention to your politicians!" 
I'd rather the candidates know nothing of Machiavelli or The Prince. Not only is the book outdated and therefore inapplicable, but it shows a very unethical way of ruling (which is in itself unethical). The idea that humanity needs a leader is not a good one, and it is only used to justifiy the injustices that a ruler would do. 
Well, yes and no. Machiavelli described various forms of government and how one, as a ruler, can implement them to maximum effectiveness.   So his advice was based on empirical evidence of successful rulers, so it can be argued that it properly defines how to run a country.   The controversy lies with the idea, supported by some, that to rule effectively does not mean ruling benevolently.   For a quick example, Machiavelli details how there was a ruler that came into power and immediately set upon purging every single person that could even remotely challenge his power. This would be regarded by many as a huge dick move, but the guy then had a lot of freedom from then on and managed to make his city prosperous and peaceful. An ideal dictatorship of sorts.  
You are not necessarily wrong, even though you're being downvoted. There is a long tradition of viewing Machiavelli's The Prince as ironic. Recent scholarship doesn't go that direction any more though, so I'd suggest to look up some recent sources and see whether you still think that to be the case. 
Don't fall into the trap of mistaking revisionist history as legitimate history. 500 years of scholars have taken that book seriously, Machiavelli wrote dozens of works from plays to novels to history, many a historian has spent their careers studying him; none of them thought this was a satire.   People like to say He liked republics and thusly couldn't to be a proponent of dictatorship. But the philosophical view of republics was different then than it is today. Today we think of republics as a form of democracy. before circa 1800 republics were thought of as being a combination of an oligarchy, a democracy and a dictatorship. Machiavelli believed that democracy was just as evil as the dictatorship, as did many thinkers in ancient Rome and Greece upon whom our model of the republic is based. 
I agree. I should probably send a short email to the creator about this- the flickering is tolerable for me, but it gets distracting in some occasions.  
As long as no one starts telling me I'm wrong for loving Thug Notes, I can continue on surviving. 
I was expecting further reading. Instead I got the episode told back to me without the jokes.  
I turned it off to just watch the show instead. Regardless of the quality and depth of the video, the show itself has taken me down some paths deeper than the show itself goes. In particular the episode with the Council of Ricks, and how vehemently Rick argues that a core quality of being a Rick is that Ricks should be anarchists.   After watching that episode I began to wonder, with an infinite number of slight variations of myself, is there one inherent quality that would remain universal?  Rick assumed that it was his anarchism, but it strikes me that he miscalled himself and it was actually his questioning nature. So, what value do I misvalue in myself, that if changed, would not fundamentally alter my existence?  
Easy views. People are desperate for rick and morty content.  
For real.  This was, bar none, the absolute worst episode of the show.  Worst.  Unfunny, ridiculous, meaningless BS.  It felt like a leftover script for an unmade episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and it probably was. 
I found that to be the best part, that all of that cult following occurred in a matter of hours.  
Nice ad hoc hominem hoc cogito culina fallacy there. 
I thought what morty meant by "come watch tv," was    just to accept your reality no point in fighting it because it gets you nowhere. 
We understand over-simplification. That's why we study philosophy. 
Also, the air we breathe, and everything else that we interact with. It's just as essential as the lung. 
Consciousness is universal and sufficiently complex systems, such as our brains, act as 'lightning rods' for this consciousness to act through. Thanks for listening to my one-sentence crackpot theory. 
Could you expand on the idea of minds only existing? Its an interesting thought 
Acknowledgeing your biology doesnt cheapen your existence! Humans are amazing enough with out having to apply made up stuff to make us seem better  
Yup. This article was basically "did you know you have a brain and it does stuff? Also fuck religion, just learn to appreciate your life here cause there's no heaven and you're as stupid as an earth-centrist if you disagree".   There is a very important need for neuroscience to understand things, but this attitude is just so pointless. First of all, consciousness is not explainable by functional neuroscience. Philosophy of mind leads us to conclude that qualia is something that needs to be scientifically explained.   Qualia is just the specific awareness of experience. Everything else is functional. Isolating that qualia aspect will maintain all neuroscience while also understanding 100% of the picture, instead of being a snobby anti-theist close minded know it all.   
Right...so you're a dualist?  What do you mean "the consciousness interprets data"?  Are you suggesting that consciousness is not physical but somehow causal?  If so, you have your work cut out for you.    If you see a ball flying at your head, you duck.  If we cut out the part of your brain that processes visual info, you get hit by the ball.  Your theory works there. If we leave the visual system intact but cut out other pieces of the brain bit by bit in every combination possible, we will eventually hit the part of your brain that "interprets" the visual scene - you'll see the ball coming but you'll get hit by it because you have no meaningful interpretation of what's happening.  Given that - there's no room for "interpretation" happening outside the brain.  If we can take all your inputs and predict all your outputs, there is no room for something "outside" your brain to do the interpretation. 
personally, i've seen so many objections to this and it is completely surprising to me. I'm in the habit of just thinking everyone understands that science has shown that it is not only plausible, but *likely* that consciousness is nothing but an emergent property of a completely materialistic brain.  
I'd think the answer is the same as to "when I open a website, do I interact with a computer program or with a bunch of chips and wires?": Yes and yes - on different levels of abstraction. 
First time I've ever seen a "Thunk" and looking forward to more.  edit--holy shit there's already 113 more. 
I subscribed to this channel after seeing an older Thunk post. I highly recommend going back and watching all his previous videos, especially the one about cognitive biases. If you go all the way back, don't mind the hats, I think the host was going through a phase. Loved all the puns though.  
That's not what the principle claims. It only implies that we are *in a position to know*, not that we *actually do know.* 
Could you elaborate on how your skepticism led into the understanding of faith and mysticism? Genuinely interested 
Unfortunately, almost every actor pushing forward a proposition has at least one thing to gain: attention. Not a very useful heuristic by itself in practice.   Looking at how much incentive they have can be one factor in your estimation, but I'd strongly disagree with "not much more to it".  
If you think it is OK I have a bridge you would totally love to buy!   
I fundamentally disagree with this article. I know a lot of people from college who grew up middle class in china. None of them felt any type of general unease at government control. We, as westerners, have rights ingrained in our society to the point where we know rights abuses when we see them. I don't think that this comes from human nature. I think it's culture internalizing legislation. Anti discrimination laws will become unnecessary at some point not because we are unbiased by nature but because western culture has used legislation to change the culture. 
Capitalism. It made it ok for people to take advantage of other people for their own benefit. Other's ignorance shouldn't be exploited, unless they've consented. Bc Violence. In that case, we must then decide if they are competent enough to make a logical decision. If they are not, what then?When will the violence and control stop? 
But morals are a societal construct as well, so that doesn't really change matters. 
I was just thinking this. Ancaps for example derive ,dare I say, all rights from bodily autonomy. 
From an evolutionary perspective, we have evolved behaviours to function within a dominance hierarchy. This social hierarchy is perhaps the most important cornerstone of the world we inhabit. Laws are the codification of these evolved social behaviours. Human rights are the codification of some of the most fundamental social behaviours when applied to the world population as one people.  
Sorry, are you actually claiming that human rights are inherent in nature? Because unless you posit the existence of a higher power, I don't understand how you've arrived at that assumption. 
One example might be how we view women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Legally, they don't have many, but there is a general perception in the West that that is a problem. That's a case where the idea of rights transcends what is legally true. 
The law, as such, was invented to protect the interests of a limited caste of people. You could say the law evolved to protect human rights, though. 
What "proper" rights do you consider to have been objectively derived? 
I am afraid there is UN declaration of Human Rights. And that is enforced. 
is that good, though? if jay walking were punishable by execution, nobody would jay walk. but it would be a hideous law. and in the abstract that's what all laws are designed to do 
Are you talking about the U.S.? Because the majority of citizens support it. The public support of it combined with key victories in various states is what led the supreme Court to hear the case in the first place.  Now go look at a country that does not have a majority of their citizens support gay marriage: chances are it isn't legal there.   That alone disproves the idea of human rights existing independently of concepts and values of society. If they truly we're independent and existed regardless, then gay marriage would be legal everywhere. 
Yes exactly. This whole thing doesn't make sense because the rewards in the payoff matrix are based on nothing but speculation. In order to compute expectation, you need a reward matrix with measurable rewards.  
Much better than I was going to express it.  The benefit of enjoying a heathen's life, should there be no benefit in the [possible] afterlife, thereby becomes of infinitesimal value.  It all really come down to making an all-or-nothing decision and living with the consequences.  Or just repent on your deathbed. 
The main thing I'm confused about is, if you believe and follow a diety(or dieties) you inherently have a hand in the pot; those ignoring any diety (like atheists and others do) don't even seem to be placing a bet at all. The only explanation that they are in the pot is the "God who only accepts people who don't worship one" view which would be a paradox.  So you can as a believer either be right or wrong about your God, or as a non believer you can either be right, which would be like never playing and not like 'winning' since you would end up with nothing, or wrong because you didn't follow the real God. The odds are infinite yes, but the rules are you have to play so the second number is constant and we can only affect the first #/&infin; 
I would agree that the biggest flaw with the God example is that in a situation where it matters the logic being used undermines the entire point of following a religion. 
I really don't think OP does. IMO, all the qualifications that he states, his gotchas, are implied in the "false wager." When people say, believing in God is worth the reward despite the fact it might not pay out, they mean specifically their concept of god. That's pretty much universally understood. 
Why do you expect "Hate" from religious people?  Most have loving and sharing intentions.  If I knew Dairy Queen was handing out free ice cream cones, and I told you because I saw that you didn't have one, would you think that's because I hate you? 
Belief is not the same as counterevidential faith. 
The utility of resources falls off as you get more of them.  $1001 is not as good compared to $1000 as $1 is to $0. 
Actually, if we have no information about God at all, then any of his possible demands has an equal probability of being real. They all cancel out, since !D is possible for every D. He could either say "don't eat fish" or "do eat fish," and so on; for every possible demand obeyed, there is an equal and opposite demand *dis*obeyed. Therefore, Pascal's Wager tells us nothing. 
I can imagine the most perfect possible argument for God. But the most perfect possible argument would be *real,* since a real argument is better than an imaginary one.  :P 
Yes, thank you. The entire article is based on a complete misunderstanding of quantum physics 
*Maimed by machine and no longer able to participate in lottery* 
This is interesting. I thought that einselection assumes that wavefunction collapse happens since the particles are in superposition before decoherence time and in a certain state after, or did I misunderstand it? 
The theory only works if you assume that the quantum changes save you in the alternate universe. If you don't start with that assumption obviously it is highly unlikely to occur. The point of thought experiments is to assume a theory as valid and to extrapolate scenarios based on that assumption.  
Just because there are infinite universes does not mean all possible universes exist. For example, if you had a set of all even numbers it would be infinite, but there is no odd number in that sequence 
Not really.  The argument for this being a simulation usually hinges on two premises.  The first is that most known universes are simulated.  We've already simulated a sizable number of them, albeit crude ones that are smaller and less complex than our own.  Nonetheless, they exists (or at least existed at one point in time, even if they have since been shut down).  So out of all the universes we are aware of, the vast majority of them are definitely simulated.  Second, we have no way of reliably determining that our universe is *not* a simulation, for much the same reasons we can't say with certainty that we are not dreaming or exist as a brain in a vat being fed false sensory data.  So basically the argument goes as follows: we don't know whether we're in a simulation or not, but to our knowledge, most universes are simulations.  Ergo, it is more probable that we are in a simulation than not. 
It doesn't matter, as you and your counterpart are exactly the same person up until that point. The universe splits AT the point you die, so up until that exact moment you essentially have no counterpart (in this particular "universe-line/time-line"). When the universe splits, THEN one of you dies and the other lives. But as you were exactly the same person in terms of memory and thoughts etc up to this point, and as you cannot be "aware" of the universe in which you die *following* death, as far as you're concerned you're always the one who survived.  
Yes. Which is true unless you don't consider your consciousness being the same consciousness as 1 second ago.  
You may exist in the non-predictable ones, just like you do in this one. The guy in the 'all coin flips are heads' universe is probably not reading this thread however, seeing as the "many universe theory" is pretty much universally accepted, since there could be no other explanation for all the weird shit they see all the time in that particular universe.  
Yes, I would say we have. You could also apply it to our existence on Earth. It's just the right distance from the sun, life was able to evolve/be seeded/whatever, and we haven't been gamma-ray-bursted. By mass alone, odds indicate we should be a big cloud of Hydrogen. 
Or is this a prediction based on theoretical knowledge about the inner workings of physical phenomena within the framework of quantum mechanics? As in, everything we know about the behavior of particles indicates that they occupy such multifarious positions or states, yet we cannot "catch" them in the act or otherwise document that they do so?  Yes. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle also states that we can only guess at either the speed or location of the particle, but not both.   Hope this helps a bit. If you are so inclined lookup Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for a better definition.  
It should be noted that the authors understanding of quantum physics seems to be shaky at best 
I don't think it would be reasonable to assume that everything will just end. After all - the universe had to come from somewhere. Also, I wouldn't trust the predictive power of modern science on those time scales, as we still don't quite have nailed down what things like dark matter and energy are. Looking at dark energy specifically, it only came into play (overtaking gravity) in the last few billion years. Who knows what other factors may emerge? 
Yes, if somebody proposes that there is a thing (system, universe, etc.) that we cannot interact with exists, it's a pretty useless proposal. it might as well not exist. If you believe the universe is made of information, you could theoretically "create" any universe/arrangement of information if it doesn't exist already, proving that everything *can* exist.  The idea of this multiverse is that there are multiple futures ahead of you at any given time, each just as real as any other, and one is assigned to you at random (or by some choosing mechanism). As soon as you observe a particle/wave thing, you find out which future you're in. This eliminates the need for a mysterious "collapse of the wave function" as suggested in the Copenhagen interpretation.  In the famous double-slit experiment, the weirdness found there can be explained by parallel universes interfering with one another. If this is a mechanism we can take advantage of, then these parallel realities will be useful to us. 
But we know enough about thought experiments to do so. 
Nothing in science explains why the universe exists in the first place. The scientific conclusion could be that nothing exists at all, so everything else that doesn't exist is just as real. 
What we measure is how the particle affects other particles, which affect other particles until it reaches our eyes/ears/etc. The numbers (0, 1, -1) are chosen arbitrarily (or out of mathematical convenience, if you prefer). I'm not sure if that's what you're asking. 
I suppose that since you still have to live with the consequences of your action the same social incentives would be in place as in a non MWI world. That is unless you kill yourself. 
The difference is that I'm privileged to my own consciousness while my assistant isn't. I wouldn't call that paradoxical but it is surely not a practical experiment... 
Yes! I believe this is an important piece of many-worlds that makes it much more elegant. 
At this point, it's useless to try and have a discussion with people because there's always a fallacy they bring up to try and discredit you. It got old fast.  
It's not a fallacy, there's just a blatantly false premise. 
I run a half marathon nearly every weekend. Now I have something to listen to when I don't feel like Dan Carlins hardcore history! 
PEL, VBW, Philosophize This, and HoP are all good. The first two are conversational, the second two are scripted. Different animals.  "In Our Time," "Philosophy Bites," "Philosopher's Zone," and "Elucidations" are also good, but they're mostly scholars talking about their own work or weighing in as experts. That's great, but there's also value in vicariously participating in a conversation among fellow learners, which is really a novel way of learning that podcasting has opened up to us. 
"I mean I get what he's saying, but this is basically the categorical imperative." - Wes 
The Tractatus episode is not the place to start... very very difficult text. Plus, the audio on that is about the worst we've had.  
I use PlayerFM and can access all of the episodes. So they have been uploaded at least. Just give it another go after restarting the app 
Uh, no. The name itself is making a philosophical point about the impossibility (and undesirability) of full, constant examination. Early episodes were concerned in part with how weird (unhealthy?) it is to actually do philosophy as a profession. 
Science tells us stuff such as last thursdayism shouldn't be true because it makes less sense than our current understanding of the universe. I think that's what he's saying here is that since it makes more sense for us to not have an otherworldly soul of some sorts it is more efficient and will make us happier to assume it does not exist and operate under the assumption we do not have/need it.  
It seems to me that Epicureanism has the opposite problem of Stoicism. Epicureanism is basically about how to maximize happiness when happiness is easy to achieve but it doesn't really prepare you for when things turn to shit. Stoicism does a good job of helping you get through shitty times but doesn't really have a lot of advice about how deal with the times when life isn't kicking you in the teeth. 
I'm interested in this perspective and philosophy. What do you mean "seem"? What would be a legit way to be interested to you? 
Manipulation usually comes through either the promise of gain or the treat of pain. If you are unconcerned with the pursuit of luxury and are also able to manage pain without much consternation, you would be hard to manipulate.   Your second question is interesting. I could imagine that establishing and exemplifying a model for the pursuit of happiness does do good for future generations. After all, what is the reason for improving life for future generations if not --- fundamentally --- to help them be happier?  
I always have lots of questions. Thanks for asking. Can this philosophy be summed up by saying: "Dont worry about what is out of your control and inevitable (fate). Be satisfied. Since you are currently in a living state you have much to be thankful for, the rest is just self induced misery." Therefore, satisfied gratefulness, is the only mindstate conducive to true happiness and fulfillment? 
Sex is kind of a necessity, just not a necessity to survival. 
Why does one have to be inspirational, why should that be the goal? Why is simple personal happiness a bad final target? 
If by emasculated you refer to the need for conflict, violent or otherwise, that's why we have sports and games. 
Yes, because Epicurus is saying that "ambition" in your context is an unnecessary and unobtainable goal that will never bring you happiness. The things most people associate with ambition (money, prestige, etc.) ultimately don't lead to happiness because there is no limit to how much those things will take to satisfy a person, making it a Sisyphean task.  
It derives from his physics (material atomism). Epicurus rejected a perfectly planned world of intelligent design, ordered and directed by divine beings. He'd point to natural disasters, drought, disease etc. to justify this. How could such perfect beings as Gods preside over such an imperfect world?    He didn't necessarily reject the concept of Gods existing somewhere, just the notion of participatory Gods intervening in human affairs.  
Well, it can but you can still choose to believe whatever you want because you still have hope. 
That level of writing is consistent throughout the New Yorker. It's the only magazine I consistently take time to read, cover to cover, in print.  Note: not friendly to anyone further right than Barack Obama. 
It's important to be skeptical about newly discovered facts. Your friends might be thinking that because it's new there hasn't been time for replicated studies, critical reviews and it is very important to find out where you got the information and also where/how your source got their information from. There's never really new newly discovered facts of life, more like, "Well for now, this is the best evidence we have that suggests etc..."   
The way people confront each other adds to this, people take aggressive umbrage which usually puts people on the defensive . That's why the best way to get someone to re-evaluate their position is to lead them to question their belief themselves. 
I would call that smart. In a sort of egotistical way. I mean we arent ants, we are mainly concerned with our own interests first, and others interests second. And it works fine. Until inequality comes into play like rich vs poor. Luckily the poor did in the past kill the rich when they were fed up and the cycle continued. All we can hope is the same is true still even with modern weapons. And that the rich will look after their own interests and not want to die. Not that I want to kill anybody. But if we dont get bread and potatoes anymore... I donno what do you think would happen?  
A parroted talking point you commonly hear on reddit is "Watch a lot of news from different perspectives"  Which is BS.  Without proper reasoning skills, different perspectives just muddy the waters and an individual is worse off than when they started. 
Well I put my trust in the system of determining facts that has brought us technology, if not for it's understandability across largely unrelated fields or it's reproducibility at the manufacturing level, then because I have lots of fun with it. 
I don't remember the article listing the actual elements tested, but there are a lot of interesting parts that can be missed. Just because you know what parts are in the toilet doesn't mean you understand the functions and principles involved. That's exactly the problem they are trying to explain in the article. I'm not doubting your ability or testing your knowledge, I'm just pointing out that some people may have never looked inside a toilet bowl, or looked at a cut out to understand how the trap works.

To ellaborate on #2, another point was that it was a way of ensuring that others weren't taking advantage by not doing or taking more than their fair share. As a result, people evolved to be critical of opposing arguments, but this did not translate into the ability to be self-critical 
Google "mercier selective laziness of reasoning". It's a 15 page pdf (about 4 google results down) of the study in detail 
The article postulates an evolutionary mechanism for irrationality in general.  
I assume you are en expert in scientific bias. What bias did you detect? You didn't mention it or provide any evidence, which is weird, because clearly you are an expert and not just a triggered right winger.  
I wonder what combination of intoxicant and location yields perspectivists.   
If I'm drunk and someone asks me whether I'd flip a switch, my response would be: "Dude, I'm drunk. I probably wouldn't be able to find the darned switch." 
Contrary to common sense, a lot of people think that things that are the best for everyone are callous and cold. People believe that *they* deserve special treatment and to be exceptions to the rules. When they are told that they are not an exception and that the rules are working as intended, they say "how can you be so cold?"  Don't believe me? Look at what people say about taxes and healthcare.  
I'd say the utilitarian choice is usually the obvious one, and it takes some mental gymnastics to reach a more philosophical idea. Drunk people can't do these gymnastics. 
It's a philosophy of ethics for determining, when you're given a list of possible actions, which action is morally the best one.   In utilitarianism, you attempt to measure the goodness of the outcome of each action and pick the action that leads to the most good. (Eg. 1 dead is better than 5 dead, so kill the one guy to save the others)  In contrast, deontologism says that you should have established rules of behavior before hand (eg. Never kill) and choose the action that obeys your rules (eg. Don't kill the one guy. Let the other 5 die) 
Most people over 18 in France will have done part or all of their final year of high school, which includes compulsory philosophy classes. So theoretically, everyone questioned will have studied at least some philosophy (although the drinking age is hardly ever enforced in France). 
Not entirely wrong, but there are times when utilitarianism would lead us to uncomfortable conclusions and deontology preserves more comfortable moral intuitions (just like the reverse is also sometimes the case). Some of the classic examples are things like the Trolly problem, or incest/necrophilia, or eating one's dead cat, or something along those lines. Most of us have strong intuitions that these things are wrong, but a utilitarian can't condemn people who engage in these activities if they're utility maximizing (and we assume that they are because nobody is harmed, or, in the case of the Trolly experiment, more people are benefited than are harmed). 
Yes, I prefer a mixed utilitarian/deontological ethics, where a few fundamental deontological rules provide constraints for the utilitarian calculus. Constrained optimization problems are both easier to solve and less likely to produce absurd solutions. 
Immanuel Kant was a real pissant who was very rarely stable; 
But Utilitarianism, here, is being described as "cold[ly] logic[al]," so the decisions made when our cognitive faculties that deal with logic and reasoning are impaired would not be examples of utilitarian thinking. 
But if I'm presented with the same situation, except that the 5 people were 5 crash test dummies, it seems obvious that I have a moral obligation to flip the switch. So it doesn't seem true in general that I can maintain moral neutrality by ignoring the situation and walking away. Do you disagree? 
Gravity causing things to fall is also embraced by drunks, as their numerous experiments in the gutter have shown. This is not damning evidence that gravity is wrong.  This result does not mean utilitarianism is wrong, merely that drunk people are more utilitarian. 
Then I guess the question is: "Who is buried in Aristotle's Tomb?" 
That was a 10 second emotional roller coaster ride:  * They found Aristotle's tomb, who cares. * Wait! THAT Aristotle! * Oh, it's undefinitive :( 
This simply wouldn't work, all jokes aside.  I read an interesting theory somewhere that if you clone Albert Einstein, his copy might not even be anything like the original Einstein.  He may look identical, but the clone's mind could be completely different.

Sounds similar to how it's pronounced in Spanish: "Arr-EES-TOH-teh-less" 
How would finding his DNA help? There wouldn't be anything to compare it to

'Send my ashes to the beach, cause waves are red'  -Aristotle. 
Who cares if this benefits philosophy? It's Aristotle's friggin tomb(Possibly). Finding his body holds historic value in its own right.  The people on /r/philosophy care for the same reason a Christian would care about finding Jesus' actual body.   Well, you could care about their bodies in both scenarios because of what would could learn about history due to finding their bodies. That's a reasonable way to look at it, but I'd imagine that most people on here just think it's cool.  
It's probably the same story, this is in Greece also 
Kind of long to go viral. Maybe a good starting video, though. I only made it through 5 minutes of 45, and the language seemed geared to people who already knew about philosophy.  
Difficult voice to keep focused on, but still really nice. Mainly analytical or not, thanks! 
There are attempts to do so, but I've found that studying the history of philosophy is a more effective way to answer your question. So instead of asking, "What are the philosophical underpinnings of all philosophies?", and getting lost in a spiral of theories to explain theories, we can ask, "How has philosophy as we know it today developed over time?"  This helps to reveal how various intellectual movements that have been labeled 'philosophy' are related, who inspired who, and what ideas paved the way for later thinkers in their formulation of new ideas.  For instance, I think it's more useful to ask the historical question "To what extent is Kant's work a response to Hume?", rather than the strictly philosophical question, "Does Kant's thesis solve Hume's problem of induction?" 
Outside Martin Bernal, do any historians believe Ancient Greek philosophers learned anything of substance from the Ancient Egyptians? 
Isn't the issue that people aren't being prosecuted for breaking rules that already exist? The whole idea of this article seems silly. It's not about rules, it's about actions.  
Also, having had this training, your colleagues are better equipped to navigate communications on delicate subjects that could have public opinion or even civil liability backlash.  Up in the cheap seats, corporate ethics is about getting covered so that litigants can't rightly argue, "that corporation shows a complete disregard for the ethical conduct of their employees."  No doubt you're getting much more sophisticated instruction, but surely most of you have the guile to understand part of this is about calling attention to subjects best handled with special care if journalists or inspectors are involved. 
The author actually concedes this point in this piece, and acknowledges that war is inherently unjust, as did Cicero and Aquinas. But all of these thinkers also accept the existence of war as a fact and proposed the just war theory as the best available remedy.  
I imagine they're being careful to avoid bad headlines and regulation so soon after all the bad headlines they've faced. It's not a set of moral decisions, but practical ones, that would lead them to calm down. 
Your notion disregards the coercive forces present within said markets and how the social relations in regards to concepts of property function altogether. 
Laws that restrict monopolies have often been effective at preventing them. Similarly, rules that regulate economies, when enforced, have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of economic downswings. The 2008 recession is the result of both deregulation and failures to enforce regulations that prevented similarly catastrophic downturns. Keynes simply works, and we have decades of statistics to back it up.  As for war, there are definitely rules, and theyou work. Hollow points see very little use on battlefields, even in brutal conflicts. Gas and biological agents are rarely seen, and governments are quick to respond when they are. Rules work.  
How do you "change the notion" of the incentive to earn a profit?  Stock price reflects the markets best guess as to the current value of all future returns. Because people can vote with their wallets, corporations, on the whole, act in their own long term interests, as devious and deceptive behavior will, on net, be reflected in future earnings. 
And if you've ever read Walzer, Nagel, or Augustine you'd know that you can, indeed, have ethical considerations in war.  Name dropping is easy. I should study philosophy. 
Can you recommend a work by Cams? I tried one several years ago and found it impenetrable. Sorry, don't remember which one.  
I think a part of that is the unknown. If we do not know how something works, we can interact with it mostly based on the input and output. I think it is a large part of why we consider ourselves special. We don't know enough about our mind so we can still fool ourselves that we are somehow fundamentally different from computers that we know exactly they work. If one day we can perfectly create, analyze, and replicate our brains, then despite our vanity, we should be capable of seeing ourselves as a biological computers rather than a unique sentient enigmas.  
It also leaves out the most interesting aspect, which is the implications of modifying minds in the context of a brutally evolved ape species.  
The Devil, too. The Man in Black, whose mission is to bring free will to the androids in defiance of "the gods," is clearly a Lucifer figure. 
Although it is a possibility, I hope they don't have that happen. I found Ford's character so compelling because of his view of the androids. If he isn't actually dead I think that takes away some of the depth of his storyline.   As for the extra robot, I think it might be an android that Ford programmed to help lead the conscious androids. This android may resemble Ford. 
"If the first season was defined by control, the second season is defined by chaos." - Jonathan Nolan    
Got to disagree with you buddy. For many people in this world, the subject of Philosophy is a big stretch away from interest or comprehension. This *'pop-philosophy crap'* that you call it, is an accessible bridge for many people who have never dabbled with philosophic topics before.   Now by all means, feel free to offer your counter arguments as to why this stuff doesn't hold up for you, but don't be a stick in the mud. 
r/iamverysmart    It doesn't pretend to be the most sophisticated philosophical analysis, and in my opinion, it serves as a catalyst to further divergent discussions rather than a definitve conclusion.   Maybe they should say this explicitly. 
I'm not a philosophy graduate or anything, but I also found the video very underwhelming.  Every point made seemed trivially obvious and failed to address *why* events are and are not correlated and/or causally related. I'm glad somebody with relevant education is calling this out.   It also seemed like he said some things that were false as well.  For example, to say "earning good grades in high school causes one to earn good grades in college if the grades are transferred" seems to me to be incorrect.  If the good grades one earns in high school are transferred to college, aren't they the same thing?  How can you say that earning good grades from high school *causes* the earning of good grades in college if what is referred to by "earning good grades" is, in both cases, the exact same event?    
Imho, "correlation is not causation" might also very well be used to deflate lazy or long-stretched arguments. Obviously, it will always depend on the argumentative framework the sentence is used in. 
I agree with you. The unfortunate fact is that a lot of people haven't developed such common sense. Although I take the view that no amount of educational videos would make them develop such a common sense either. 
hey man, just because you know it, doesn't mean everyone else does. Props to you for remembering grade school though, give yourself a pat on the back. 
Yeah or how the decline of pirates correlates with the rise of the global temperature. 
Basically.  Not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles. Etc. etc.  The parent-child and sibling-sibling problem. 
The key point is that you find something(IV) that changes one but does not change the other (say cause and outcome). Then looking at how much the IV changed the outcome, relative to its effect on the cause, provides an estimate of the effect of cause on outcome. 
Ever since I got this tattoo on my forehead, I haven't repeated a single misleading study. QED 
I think one could argue, semantically, that all events have a cause.   Something caused that event to occur, whether or not it's correlated with a second event occurring.      
Rules vs Exceptions. You won't always die falling out of an airplane without a chute opening, but I wouldn't bet on not dying if you fall out of an airplane without your chute opening. 
We use Sparkol's VideoScribe! Great program, very easy to use. 
This is accurate.  The majority creates a society of those sharing the "mostly" similar ideals, rather than a few over the majority... which in Democracy is a flaw.  The few learn quickly how to manipulate the many.   
Reasoning should not be subordinate to personal beliefs, and you should not hold everything you think in high esteem.  Additionally, its fine to not form an opinion on/belief about something. Largely preferable even. Its just being intellectually honest considering the often limited/flawed available data on a given subject. 
who decides the content of the education?  who certifies who is educated and who is not? 
I think you just did.  You perceived a post, considered it, intended to reply, and I'm here to claim you really did.   
But there's no reason why *subjectivity* can't be an intrinsic property of the universe.  If you want to make a compelling argument as to why that isn't the case, then you should be able to positively identify a minimum set of circumstances required for subjectivity to emerge. 
They're distinct in that one can't describe an *experience* (i.e. a what-it's-like quality) by describing physical states.  One could conceivably describe what a cake is by describing physical states (at least, to a degree).  
Also full of weasel words and sentences that lead you to baseless inferences. 
The point is that you can't. Consciousness is something other than the objective; it is its complement  
The experience is subjective *precisely* because you can't be sure that your experience is the same as that of any other person. In other words, your experience of the color red doesn't have to be like the experience of the rest of the world for it to be meaningful.   So if a blind person were to spontaneously hallucinate the color red, he would have a sudden understanding of what it means to see and what it means for something to be red. Let's suppose that this blind man was miraculously cured of his blindness, presented with a color wheel and then asked "do you recognize any of these colors?"   The blind man, having hallucinated the color red already, would point at the red portion of the wheel and say "I know that one, though I don't know what it's called." 
totally agree. Way more applicable to the real world than a lot of philosophical discourse and that's kind of the theme of the article.  
I came here looking for someone to say this. It's hotly debated whether or not *the Prince* was a work of satire.  
I found that before I read it I could kid myself into thinking the politicians were just incompetent. Now it just seems like they're doing it on purpose! Make's you think - if politicians weren't Machiavellian would they even be at the top? 
Machievelli didn't really advocate for cruelty to the populace in the sense of a Kim-Jong Un or a dictator. While cruelty is evil, it can serve a purpose (I believe 1 example was the public display of a cruel man who was murdered and left out for all to see). And even then he said that you should do it in 1 quick succession so that nobody can take up arms against you and so the hated of the people would fade with time. 
Glad you mentioned this, because this article's interpretation of The Prince is a more outdated opinion. 
Maybe if you bought the "Cliff Notes" for specific books, then you might understand the meaning of  the story and style of the author. These notes sometimes are used to bypass reading the assignments, but using them together with the book could help you remain interested.  
While I don't agree the book was a satire, it wouldn't matter. The subject matter is held in high regard and holds valuable information for ruling subjects. In other words; whether or not the book is satirical, or whether or not Machiavelli was just joking around is irrelevant and your professor did you a disservice. 
Who say they aren't?  For the analogy to be as close as possible, the requirement is humans obliviousness to the fact that they are livestock.  
A vapid meat eater huh? So you like your meat boring.  Nah, but in actuality I agree with your comment in that I find this carnivorous sentiment distasteful. 
Nature is arguably far more cruel and animals suffer far more when in nature. It's full of starvation and ruthlessness.  If it was between living in a non factory farm (which is disgusting) or in the wild, I might choose the farm.  Food security, safety from predators, communal living. Sure there is death at the end but my life expectancy would be higher on the farm (obviously not in all situations e.g. lamb or calf). 
And unless you're the one carrying this out and have a way to not get caught, what makes you or anyone you know and love immune from the "culling"? 
Fucking thank you, I'm glad somebody here said it.  
A key to the argument is that animals live happy and comfortable lives until their premature death. I don't think anyone is arguing that the way many industrial farmers treat animals bred for food production is ethical. It's an argument that prematurely killing them might not necessarily be unethical, as long as we also treat them well while they are alive. 
And occasionally are forced to cannibalize, leading to prion diseases... 
I see your logic but by that logic we should all go totally vegan (as in not eating or using any animal products), stop owning pets or livestock and all zoos/wildlife places that aren't for species preservation purposes as well as all circuses (because there still are some) should close down and we should give all animals all human rights as well as political power (and we should learn the animals' language naturally because would *we* want to be uplifted through cybernetic implants?). 
That seems true, I've read a bit about the gates foundation. As I understand it Bill and his wife set the high level goals. Then they have people to see those goals are met, these people are professional and knowledgeable in their field and want to do good. Also I feel like this article doesn't consider that philanthropic organizations like the Gates foundation can direct money across borders. The W.H.O. is comparatively weak not because it lacks funds but because countries don't like big powerful NGOs telling them what to do. 
Exactly. This boner's idea to have Zuckerberg's shares put into a trust and then have the public vote on where the funds should go is beyond moronic.  
It's funny how the Catholic church in my own country don't want to apologize to victims of church sanctioned paedophilia until they are compelled by a court but feel so brazen as to wave the flag of, "human beings have an innate dignity and you best respect that", when pointing the finger at other people. Other people who spend billions of dollars curing disease nonetheless.  
The teachers should run the school systems not people with contrary interests to both the students and teachers. 
You know there was a time where the income taxes on the top earners was around 80-90%. We call people from that era "the greatest generation." Maybe we shouldn't rely on the humanity of people to maintain our clean waterways and interstate system.  Just a thought.  
I enjoyed the read because its interesting to think about how if we assume the catechism is correct that "The goods of creation are destined for the whole human race" how can we reconcile that with the idea of the philanthropy or "love of all people" being increasingly controlled by powerful individuals who then decide what that "love of all people" means.  
I remember, as a young boy, when Microsoft's cronies came to our home and stole my mother's pearls. Then they peeled out while chugging Red Bull, leaving only a copy of Windows 95 in their wake. Damn capitalists! Stop making things people have a use for, you know we can't control ourselves! 
You have to really abuse the word "selfish" to construe working one's whole life to generate a fortune and then giving it away to be "selfish". If you don't like what these people are doing with your fortune you are free to make your own and give it to the government or a public trust.  Having the government seize it and waste a lifetime of work in a few days of war and wiretapping is a position driven by envy and bitterness. 
What, you think that capitalism is magically moral? That the invisible hand of the market will give money to those who need it most if you reduce your profit margins? That's just silly. It's transferring culpability and responsibility to a faceless mechanism that was never designed to perform that task and never has performed that task efficiently. 
I've yet to see this  Firs time I've looked at r/philosophy 
Sometimes you dont know if youre actually helping people and sometimes so called philanthropists are scammers. Its fine to be skeptical, discussion should have no bearing on the genuine philanthropists anyway. 
DAE addicts are scum of the earth and don't deserve compassion and understanding and help for their obvious self medicating behavior, poverty and hopelessness, but these obscenely wealthy capitalists who steal labor value of others and then launder their vast amounts of wealth through their charitable organizations for tax reimbursements and good PR are totally awesome?  This sub is rife with ridiculous neoliberalism and bootlicking. Disgusting. 
Gates has given away over $30B already in his life. Real piece of garbage.  
Metaphysics is crucial to formulating potential outs in physics discoveries but I doubt any modern day metaphysics philosophers know or even engage with the world of experimental physics in a meaningful way. At best its a poorly informed parrot of paper conclusions and abstracts. 
Well, before there was anything, before there was apace or time or hyper-time, dimensionality, or the 'physical universe' (which only existed for you when you were born.) what was there? Can you think along those lines? That would be along the lines of Metaphysics. How did you find out about stuff, after you were born? Two brothers, having the same parents and growing up in a family still can have different outlooks...I mean other than through conditioning. 
You don't know what metaphysics is. It has nothing to do with crystals, auras or any new age woo. 
Zagsebski (i think thats how her name is spelled) helps highlight the  main tension that Gettier cases bring up. If your view of knowledge includes a form of justification which is independent of truth to some extent then it will be susceptible to counter examples where even though you will fulfil whatever set of conditions you want then you will not have a case of what one would intuitively call knowledge.   
Doesn't it seem then like you're in the category of "throw up your hands and admit that you can never 'know' anything"? 
I read somewhere that he has the highest citations-to-words-written-ratio by a factor of at least 10!! 
JTB + ABILITY to reflect on one's answer was my Epistemology professor's favorite 
But, in this context, 'I can see Zuckerberg standing before me' implies the statement 'Zuckerberg is at the concert.' The fact that Kanye can see someone who looks like Zuckerberg justifies his belief. His belief is also true. Therefore, the argument goes, the JTB account has to say Kanye *knows* Zuckerberg is at the concert. But this conflicts with our intuitions, so the conclusion is that JTB is false. 
True, but I think that's true of a lot of things in philosophy! Part of being a philosopher is taking edge cases too seriously! 
You're collapsing the justification and truth aspect into one. This would make emperical knowledge production impossible; how do you prove something is true? And not just "beyond a reasonable doubt", because that's justification territory.  
I ... what? Justification is not needed if everything is going right? You *are* kidding, I want to hope. 
The thing is, RD's definition of knowledge isn't the one we want to say applies to things like "I know how to get to the store from my house". We can certainly always be fallible, but to be permanently open is to lead to global skepticism that we truly cannot know anything and that doesn't seem very useful for us to believe. It's self defeating anyway (cause how can you know that you know nothing).   Epistemology is about finding a non-Cartesian definition of knowledge.  
It's not about believing outside testimony. The common definition for knowledge has been "justified true belief" up until the time of Gettier. Do you think knowledge does not require belief? 
Piggybacking off the top comment, but thanks to you (PM_ME...) and the rest of posters who provided criticisms and questions. I'll take more care to address these in my next videos. I've already made changes based on certain responses that made me more aware of what I need to make clearer.   Thanks!  Also, I'm very aware that this first video was *very* lacking and is more claim than explanation. First video, and it was rushed for the sake of putting something out. 
Precisely because of the thesis-antithesis-synthesis bs. Someone took a class or read a book and saw a similar pattern to 'false flag' crisis manipulation as a triad of creating a fictitious problem and fanning the flames of public reaction towards a desired predetermined solution outcome.  Nothing to do with Hegel, it just sounds a lot more ominous if you connect an old philosopher considered to be super intelligent with shady power-players controlling everything thanks to having knowledge of this philosopher's work. 
He clearly states that his method is not a typical method, it is not a formula to repeat on all content like formal logic's rules are.   Sublation is a *very early* concept in the Phenomenology and Logic, chapter 1 stuff. It's a descriptive concept, not an active one. 
No. Hegel is very stand-alone (especially the logic), background only makes things more interesting and clearer in context. 
No need. All you need to know is thesis, antithesis, synthesis right? I mean, he says it so often in Phenomenology... /s 
But... he didn't try what you're saying he did. Second,, it's not *that* hard when you finally get how to read him. It's hard, but not impossible. 
To get rid of arbitrary/contingent factors and maintain a purely necessary conceptual structure. If you intend to conceive what something is and necessarily must be, it must be on its own ground and no other. If it has context, you must likewise derive that context either from it or it from that context, and that context must itself be derived from something that eventually is actually absolute and not contingent or arbitrary. 
He had personal problems with him, his critiques aren't good. 
I'll take that in mind and work it in to further vids. 
" I can't bake a cake today and eat it yesterday, the period wherein I baked the cake comes logically prior"  Perhaps not the exact same cake you described.  But if you were to never die and live millions of billions of trillions of years, a cake MAY appear in front of you one day.  You may eat it, think it was great, try to recreate it...  ...and then it disappears the next day right in front of you 
1. Surely everyone can have a perspective about race since, insofar as race even exists, we all have one?  2. Surely anyone can be as objective as anyone else therefore?  3. Isn't demanding that there be a black contributor without regard to the merit of their contribution or the volition of the contributor... solely because of their race... racist? 
I'm mostly riffing off of the word "autopoiesis" but I realize the semantic isn't exactly the same between the two.  But by teleopoiesis I literally mean "the making of end directed behavior." 
There is a lyric from The Prince of Egypt movie (wait wait...stay with me) that goes "when all you've got is nothing g,there's a lot to go around."  I've always liked that lyric and I feel it is more or less true. There is a stark difference when hanging out with a bunch of "lower class" people vs. "upper class". It's so prevalent that there are plenty of Hollywood movies that touch on this very idea.  
I am glad OP had such a good experience but much like you, I had a bad experience living in a "bad neighborhood". There was a general rule in the town I lived in that you did not live on a street with a letter for a name because these were the neighborhoods with the most crime. They were right. One time I came home and someone had thrown a large rock through our window. Another time, I came home and it looked like someone had tried desperately to kick our door in. There were footprints all over the door, luckily it held up but another couple of kicks and it probably would have given. When kicking the door in did not work, they just smashed a window (note that this all took place in broad daylight) they ransacked the house and tossed everything everywhere, stole a couple of things. Great for OP to have had a good experience but I refuse to go through this again so I will be avoiding the "bad neighborhoods" from now on.  
Some homeless people are ok. My friends in college used to give away peanut butter sandwiches to homeless people around the city. Some of the people we met were functioning, in that they were coherent and could carry a conversation. They chose the life they lead. Others were probably insane. Many homeless are veterans with psychological issues.   Just because people are dirty doesn't mean they are bad people. Sometimes they just don't want to get caught up in the rat race of life or they went through a crisis and are trying to come out the other side. Lots of them are mentally handicapped though and that's why I would recommend caution when approaching homeless folks even if you have good intentions.  
Yeah, and a person got murdered in his neighborhood. I think this guy isn't seeing the big picture here. 
Yeah, I live in the "bad" part of town and I love my apartment and being close to everything, and I don't plan on moving soon. But, I'm finding myself being envious of the house my sister and her husband just bought in the suburbs. It would be nice walk outside of my building and not see vomit or urine or used needles and getting hit up for change or smokes every 10 feet.  
I guess because his neighbourhood isn't too bad, all in. I'm in a similar situation- I moved to the "diverse" part of the city and people talk about it like it's scary, but it is so nice! I never have any trouble and I can get waffles and kebabs at 4am. Living the dream. 
Yep. I hear gunshots often, and regularly see police responding to calls but never actively patrolling. Never felt the need to buy a gun before I moved here, but now my roommates and I each keep one in our rooms and we have a "what to do if you have to defend yourself or your home" card on the fridge. The neighbors are all super nice, but I'm sure they all have weapons in their houses as well (though that's pretty much everyone in this town tbh) 
I would actually, probably be pretty hilarious to murder. You'd be all stabbing me to death with this stupid, serious look on your face and I'd gurgle in my own blood and say, "hey, you missed an organ."  
One single murder does not mean dangerous at all. It could be a neighborhood of 100,000 people.  
Perhaps. My next door neighbor sells weed. A couple weeks ago I answer my doorbell after midnight to find a young black couple utterly surprised to see me answer the door. I told them they were looking for Sha'niece next door. They thanked me and then the guy said, "don't call the cops." "Oh, I wouldn't, why did you even? What? No. Don't worry." I replied. Then I realized he only said that because I am white. It was the first time I was a victim of prejudice. I was pretty excited. It was just like when I got my first pimple. I was so stoked to oxycute it.  
Thankfullly, my neighborhood does not have a gang problem. I see some teenagers walking around at night with their friends and the worst I think they're up to is smoking weed. That's no worse than anything my suburban friends did back in the day. We were probably even dumber, breaking into the local golf course to climb the water tower and drink vodka 100 feet up. Lucky no one died.  
They're not puppies. If he wanted them to go away, he'd ask them to, and most likely, since he's been cool to them, they would do it.  
I've heard the phrase, "don't shit where you eat," but I thought that was just something my mom said to scold my brother for pooping on the dinner table.  
Oh, you will, you're just new so it throws people off. Just say good morning or something to the neighbors every so often if you see them and wish them a good day or someshit and you'll be fine.  
I got the Not Hotdog app on my phone and I constantly find excuses to make my girlfriend groan and test the app. We were in line at the gas station last week behind a guy buying a hotdog. I loaded up the app, grabbed his shoulder, and said, "hang on. Let me verify this for you." I snapped a picture and it came up Hotdog. I showed him, the clerk, and my girlfriend. Everyone involved was so confused except my gf who wanted to disappear and disown me. It was hilarious to me. Occasionally since I'll grab her hand while she's about to take a bite of something. She'll be caught off guard until I pull out the phone, snap a pic, and say, "yep, not Hotdog," after which she groans and probably questions why she's even with me to begin with.  
Caught me quite surprise with the Germany twist. I've grown up being taught that Americans should take pride in the diversity of our heritage. We should accept all religions, races, and such because we are all minorities in some way. If we protect the rights of all minorities, we're less likely to ever find our own backs against the wall.  Because every American is a minority in some way.    As such, I'm very disappointed in the current political climate. I'm not surprised. But I'm disappointed. We claim to be a freedom loving nation. Once we legislate caveats to those freedoms, we're totally full of shit. We're a nation of immigrants. Well, not any more. We support freedom of religion - asterisks. For shame.  
Wow, thanks for saying that. Kind of humbling and I'm not sure I deserve such praise.  
Whoa. What's the "AROUND" operator? I've never seen that before. Is there a list of such operators? 
This was actually one of my first thoughts. But based on their comment history I really don't think I know them. They seem to live on a different continent to me.  I can only assume that, at some point, I mentioned this on Reddit. It's still amazing though - if I did mention it, it would have been a year ago, and it can't have been a particularly popular thread.   Maybe tomorrow, when I've calmed down, I'll go through my comment history and try to figure this out. But then again, I kinda enjoy the mystery of it all. Maybe I'll just leave it... 
What song?   My advice would be to post it to a random thread on Reddit, wait a year or so, and eventually some random person will PM you a link. It worked for me, it'll probably work for you too.  
Yeah. Read the whole story and was looking forward to hearing something that wasn't generic car ad crap. Was disappointed. 
Yeah I like it. Me jamming to it is helping with my paper grading in any case :D 
Modern TV's should have an option for song titles to appear in the corner of the screen :o. 
And the YouTube comments section for the ad is now filled with "Shh bby is ok". 
Haha really? Tracking down the driver, that's impressive. You are my kindred spirit. We made it!  I had to delete that YouTube comment, it had my real name associated with it.  
Ha, yeah, it's definitely not the sort of thing I normally listen to. And as I said, I won't be downloading the full song, it was pretty disappointing. But you know how music sometimes just grabs you, even if you know it's shit? I can't explain it. I guess the fact that I couldn't have it made me want it more.   Honestly, I've had about 50 people reply to tell me how shit the song is (with varying degrees of politeness). I've ignored them all, but I'm replying to yours because you seem to have put a bit of time into it.   But then again, I've also had loads of people replying to tell me how much they love the song. Music taste is just one of the most subjective things there is - I thought this was commonly-accepted? I'm sure there's stuff you enjoy that your friends think is utter garbage - and vice versa.  
OK now I'm really freaked out.   HOW DO THEY KNOW I'VE GOT A REALLY SMALL DICK?!?!?!? I know for a fact I've never posted pictures of my dick on Reddit.  
Thanks! I have no idea as of yet but I'm thrilled either way! 
THIS.  SLEEP NOW!  I have a 9 year old and I haven't slept since BEFORE he was born.  Also, congratulations.  There is nothing better than fatherhood! 
I just got off a 14 hour flight back from England  T'WAS HELL 
Congratulations!!!!!  My husband and I tried for a year, saw the doctor, started fertility drugs, and got pregnant and had a healthy, happy baby. (Yay!) On his first birthday, we discovered we were having another one. (Oops.) Everything worked out fine-the kids are closer in age than we'd hoped, 20 months-but I just want to warn you, trouble conceiving once doesn't mean trouble conceiving always! Lol!   Seriously, parenthood is amazing. Congratulations to you and your wife.  
It felt real good when I did the sex with my penis  
27 and 22 ay? Ok well do you mind if I message you sporadically for the next two decades about advice? 
No idea! Don't wanna know till the day of arrival! 
It's really so much easier than you think it'll be. You've managed to keep yourself alive thus far-you'll probably do the same for your kid. My first was a month early and my husband and I hadn't even put his crib together yet. We had no idea wtf we were doing. But he's 3 and doing fine!  
Same here, but if OP is stoked about it, hooray for him! 
I'm genuinely in shock and excitement. I've never felt like this before, I'm seeing the world in a whole new light! 
Congrats to you as well! I hope everything goes smoothly.  
Healthy. Cliche but boy or girl doesn't bother me, I'm already raising a step child at the moment. Kinda freaked out about if anything goes wrong though. 
If you're not in America or the UK that's irrelevant, because that's where 90% of redditors are. 
I just had se-ee-eeex, and it felt so good, (felt so good)! 
Haha I told his Sister and she told him how disgusting he was before I let her in on it.  It was pretty funny.   
I'll do what I can to limit the frat parties.  Thank you!  
Wow, I'm proud of her, too! I hope I can be as successful.   
I'm sorry I toyed with your emotions. My ex husband was a jerk, you can comfort me about that?  
Haha, well it's a short walk to crazy from here, I won't let them waste the gas driving.   
Haha I'm like 10 yrs older than my professor this semester.  I should!  
Haha, thank you!  He does think I'm awesome.  He has 13 degrees himself.  Masters and a few bachelor's and associates. He is so very encouraging!  He thinks I'm the best thing since sliced bread.  I just appreciate him so much.  He thinks I'm smart, so I'm just going to work hard and do my best.   
Um... Tommy Chong has rectal cancer. Is that better? That ruined my day.  :p 
You mean refrain? I'm sorry.  I thought I was being funny.  I'll try again.   
Really? That's great! Was it hard?  I'm kind of worried I am not smart enough anymore.  No school in like 28 yrs.  So far so good but I heard the program is hard 
I was, too.  And I believe you should be!  It's so very important.  There's always time for other stuff later.   
Oh, that's awful and awesome!  Wait... You know what I mean!  So what are you studying?  
Dorm sex would be weird!    Thank you! Best wishes to you.  What are you studying?  
Thank you so much!!  I'm happy for your mom, as well! Tell her an internet stranger is proud of her!  
Thank you so much!  I'm happy for your family!  Hug your mom for me, please.  
It's really strange that so many people care what I have to say and actually like what they hear.  I'm really shocked.  This is a quiet,  little sub of nice people, and I just thought I'd get a little laugh.  It's really weird.   
I'm from the mid US.  There is a history of inherited mental illness in our family.  Passed from my grandfather (I suspect) to my mother, to me, to my children ,one of whom killed himself.  I've been drawn to the mentally ill for some time and enjoy helping them.   What are your views?   
It's really different to be back in a classroom after 28 yrs.  Trying to relearn how to learn.  But so far so good!  
It's crazy!  I was just trying to be funny.  I had no idea!lol 
That's wonderful!  I hadn't thought of being a practitioner in psychiatry.  That's something to think about.  I'm so glad she has helped you.   
He does, too!  He tells his work mates all the time!  Actually, he tells them all kinds of stuff.  Lol 
I know I'm a bad person.  I'm sorry... Kinda... Sorta.  
Aww!  I'm sorry I made you feel bad! I usually only use my super power on my kids!  Lol. And thank you! Also.... You be you.  If it makes you happy, and no one is being lied to,  do you.   
Thank you!  Send me the bill from the cardiologist.  Or you could wait until I'm a nurse and I'll check on you!  
Thank you! I'm so excited. I've gotten A's in my first class on everything.  I've never done a power point before and I scored over on it.  It was pretty fun!  
I have no idea!  Put it in your Google calendar? Thank you for the thought!  
Few reasons. My mother was ill, and she passed it to me, in turn I passed it to my son who committed suicide 8 yrs ago. I didn't know I was sick, just thought all the crazy ups and downs were normal. Didn't know my mom was sick until recently because she died before I was two. I have a feeling, reading her file, it was not an accident when she died. I've always been drawn to the mentally ill, and I just want to help the people that are closest to my heart. I believe because I was sick and am now stable several years, that I have a unique perspective to offer and give hope.

Yeah, that was kind of the joke,  sorry, I'm the freshman.   
That's really encouraging!  I hope I do well.  Nervous still! But I'm doing OK so far.  Have A on everything so far 
Thank you!  Yes, like an episode of snapped and I'd be getting my degree in prison .lol 
Thank you!  You are awesome, by the way.  Good job!  I'm nervous but I really want this.   
I can.  I don't mind.  I raised 4 kids.  I'm used to it.  :) 
I think it depends on where you go.  Some nursing is more hands on.  Thank you, though.  
Haha thank you!  My humor is a little.... Different  
There are! And I'm really excited about exploring as many as I can.  Thank you!  
I'm going to order one first thing tomorrow!  I'll wear pigtails and everything.  Lol 
No, we are married.  I just started school so I am a freshman in college, so the freshman he is sleeping with is me, see?  
Thank you!  I appreciate those in the field so much.  They have a hard job, but it's so rewarding when you can help.  
Wow! You are welcome!  I'm so happy right now!! You will be amazing!  Thank you!  
I'm sorry,  take a deep breath and have a drink of water.  Head over to /r/aww for a minute to regroup.  :)   and thank you.  :) 
I will do that!  And thank you!  Your mom is a special lady.  My grandmother was a nurse, eventually the director of nurses at her hospital.  People would stop me on the street years later and tell me about how she was an angel of mercy to them.  I don't want all that,and neither did she. I just want to help people.  Hug your mom for me.  I'll message you later.  
:) I'm glad.  I like making people happy.  It's my best and worst feature.  
Oh, wow! That's awesome!  I needed to hear that!   
We do have one on the ceiling... That would have been funny.  Haha 
My late mother was a prominent scholar and professor teaching in universities in several countries and working on key projects for the EU. She never stopped her academic work while raising us.  
I spend too much time in that sub, and that's EXACTLY what it would say!  Sometimes I'm over there and I just think... Wow... Really?   
Thank you!  I appreciate hearing that I'm brave!  Because it was really scary and still is.  So far so good.  
Lol, no I had not.  Let's see how my writing class goes first.  
Ah! Nice!  So what did you decide to be when you grew up?  
Yes, he insisted I needed a 'younger man' in my life.  He's such a goober.  
Thank you.  Hopefully I'll enjoy it!  If not,  I look into another aspect of nursing.  I really feel like that is where I belong.   
You are probably right, because your upvote quote is the same as /u/Supernintendolover's - "master of karate and friendship". 
Yes, because it's done with subreddit styles. Apps don't use subreddit styles. Or at least none of the major ones do; it's possible, but it likely wouldn't play nicely with the app's layout (not to mention that it requires a full browser -- CSS support is extremely complex).   
I'm on a PC and the message is in red...you have to be quick because the message fades up. 
Ohhh my gosh that's cool !  Upvotes for rockets!  /r/blep has the cutest upvote kitty face. And when you make a comment, it's another kitty that appears as the curser.  That's a cute tool for that sub! :d 
There's new ones here!  We should start another thread!  Yours said:  *Out of body, back in five minutes.* 
Yay!  Upvotes for everyone on this thread!  It made for an interesting Thursday I would say.  :-)  Well I never 
"WHOOMP THERE IT IS"  p/s: what I saw when I upvoted you. This almost feel too coincidental to be true. Are these mods real? Maybe mods are just a collective manifestation of a supercomputer hiding behind reddit. Is this sub real, or is this an alternate reality? What does 'real' even mean? 42?  
Batman has that affect on me too.    I can relate to your giggles.  2Casual4Me 
This was a fun experience.  I liked all the upquotes.  Let's get weird 
Yes, I agree.  These messages are cute & funny!  Come on and slam  
OMGAKITTY.  Come on get happy.  It's a good feeling actually. :d 
I'm glad because the fun is almost ending.  It was a hell of a ride.  You missed out on some of it.  But you need to at least catch the ending.  Pyrowolf8 is awesome  
Are you on a PC?  Use FireFox or Chrome.  That appears to be the browsers that show the upquotes as someone called them.    Upvote people on this sub and a quote appears.  You have to be fast, because it's in red and it fades upwards quite quickly.  If you miss it, upvote again, the arrow becomes gray and if you upvote again you can see the message again.  Keep doing those steps until you can read the message completely.  Hope that helps.  "What are these words?" 
Yes, that's coool tooo... Would be better if there were more quotes like on here.   wumbo 
I think so...these comments don't lie.  I think it's literally all true!  :d  2Casual4Me 
Yayyyy!  that is awesome.  This was one of the most funnest threads *I* have ever been involved in.  Thank you!    And *Nope, Chuck Testa*....hehe :D 
I'm really glad to hear this! I could hardly say anything so I just kind of blurted out what felt right. I've said in other comments that I really just felt like what was happening was just going to let everybody down. So I felt like somebody needed to hear that I wasn't doing it deliberately. 
Maybe its odd to say, but I would imagine that particular night  was much worse for my friends and family than it was for me. The recovery afterwards definately sucked though. 
No problem! Most people think that its really strange that I was concious up until the fact. A lot of the doctors wanted to interview me about the experience after they had found out. 
At least I made an impression somewhere, I suppose haha 
The girl did survive, her car ended up spinning out and hitting a utility pole after we hit her. She went to the hospital for minor injuries according to the police report.  My friend was trapped in the car because the dash had folded in and pinned his leg to the seat. The fire department ended up using a bottle jack to push it back forward enough to get him out. He also went to the hospital but was only bruised. 
No, I really don't. It was just like I had nodded off and had a very rude, yet much appreciated awakening. 
It didn't feel like any time had passed. I had no idea that I had died. I learned it later at the trama center while I was getting my stitches.  I actually can't answer if I was groggy or not; honestly I don't think so though. I mean, I was jolted awake and then given shot after shot of adrenaline. They're pretty mean with those shots too. I got one of them right in the chest. After that you're pretty awake haha 
A couple of recent episodes of the Mysterious Universe podcast has focused on near death experiences. Fascinating stuff. A lot of people having out of body experiences.  
That's really interesting. I was actually put under to have my wisdom teeth pulled and I had a dream that I was the dentist pulling them!  I'm glad your mom made it through. Being shocked is a super strange experience. 
As in "the light at the end of the tunnel" occurrence? No, literally the only way for me to explain it is by attributing it to a dreamless night of sleep.  When I woke up I remember being really warm though, which people like to joke about quite often.  
Really? This story comforts me that I won't feel a thing and will not notice dying the same way I can never remember the moment I feel asleep.  
haha it's okay! reading it once is enough.  I had gone through the windshield, as I was ejected I had gotten major lacerations to my head, face, and shoulders. I assume the one that was bleeding the most was from above my left eye up to about the top of my head. 
Thank you for reading it. I'm also pretty happy to still be here! If not for anything I would hate to think of my friend blaming himself for it. 
Mostly bloodloss, I lost an estimated 3 - 4 pints. I also had some minor swelling in my brain and a concussion. Which is probably why I started to lose my motor skills in my hands. 
haha something along the lines of "HOLY SHIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED." and then I was confused about the ambulance guy yelling at me and the ambulance girl yelling at him and then I got a lot of shots.  I had a chance to think about it later though and I realize that they were probably just communicating with eachother on a play-by-play of what was happening.  
Yeah my memory was fine, I don't vividly remember much of my time in the actual hospital, but I attribute that to the pain medication that I had been given. I don't have any memory problems from it. 
I know from the police report that her car had spun out and hit a utility pole on the opposite side of the road and that she had gone to the hospital with minor injuries. 
Wow, that's terrible. Hearing was the last thing that I remember, I couldn't really hear what was going on around me though. It was more like my body tuned to the sound of my heartbeat. 
You are correct, I'm also not a medical professional and I'm not exactly sure of the steps that they took in between heart stopping and defibrillation. I know they did chest compressions, and I assume that there was also some kind of medication in there.  The man from the ambulance told me himself how long it had been though, its the only reason I know.   
It hurt a lot for about the first 2 minutes. After that I between the shock and Adrenalin none of the pain is particularly memorable. 
That and the way the bystanders were looking at me were some of the worst parts of the whole thing. It really felt that it was something that shouldn't be allowed to happen by the laws of nature. 
yeah I did get transfusions, but i'm not exactly sure how much I was given. I assume that it was mostly blood loss that brought me to the point I was at. I also had minor brain swelling. 
Hopefully most people find it a lot less eventful. 
I mean that's the point though. You can return from the brink of death. Death is permanent though. It's semantics I know, but you can't have died and still be living, it violates the definition of the word death. 
you will be in a very controlled environment, I'm sure that everything will work out just fine for you! 
Yes I did, and I told her that I had heard her while I was being loaded in the ambulance. She cried a lot and I gave her a thumbs up because I couldn't move enough to hug her. We laughed about how awkward it was. 
Yeah I lost about 3 - 4 pints of blood, mostly from my head, neck, and shoulder region. I had a gash that went from above my left eye and up to about the middle of my head.  
diabetes is no joke, make sure you take care of yourself! 
1. Yes, he got away with very minor injuries. A bruised leg and a bit of whiplash.  2. Yes, I had lost a ton of blood. They had a hard time cutting my clothes off because they were heavy from it.  3. I had some serious lacerations on my head, neck, and shoulders. my biggest one being from right above my left eye running up to about the middle of my head. second biggest was on my shoulder, about 4 inches across and a quarter of an inch deep. I also had ripped a muscle in my back and compressed a spinal nerve on my right side.  4. I was in the road, about 4 feet away from the front of the car. 
No, I had my blood donor card with me so they hooked me up to a blood pack right away. They also did chest compressions which from my understanding is to circulate your blood while your heart isn't working.  I ended up pretty lucky, I didn't even have broken bones. It was just bunch of really nasty cuts, a torn muscle, and a compressed spinal nerve. 
Yeah I had no idea how odd of a thing it was until a person in their residency asked if they could interview me about it for a paper. 
Wooo! I'm not so strange afterall!  Thanks for what you do! 
Haha thanks! Hopefully I'm here to stay for a while. 
haha The only really nasty ones are hidden under my hair and the doctors did an especially good job with the stitches on my face.   My cuts were pretty clean so they healed nicely. 
Actually no I was told that I'm not at any kind of extra risk of a heart attack or anything because of it. My ears would ring on and off for a few days and I would get spots in my vision but that could have also been from any number of things. 
In the beginning, before I could actually feel that I was dieing, I had a lot of random thoughts that were just me reflecting on my life, but nothing too crazy. Things that I was happy I had done, I was glad to be single and not have any children at the time.  I was in college at the time; English lit. Major and my focus was on children's literature. My only morbid thought was wondering which quote I would want on my gravestone.  
Not at all, it was like no time had passed. I couldn't feel the chest compressions, and there was no pictures or dreams. I know that a lot of people have those types of experiences and I believe people when they talk about them, but it's not how it was for me. 
Hell yes I did. I've recently answered this twice but its worth saying again.  While I was in the hospital I told her that I had heard her call out to me while I was being loaded into the ambulance and that I love her too. It made her cry a lot. My dumb ass gives her a thumbs up because I can't really move. It was so awkward that It made her laugh. 
Haha it sucked at the time, but i'm still here and well. I can't complain too much about it. 
I had an awkward conversation once where I tried to practice my Mandarin Chinese on this girl from Hong Kong. In my defence she told me she was Chinese, so it wasn't a terrible assumption to make. :) 
I like languages, so didn't really think much of it at the time. I guess when you grow up speaking English, you don't really think of other people learning your language as anything other than normal.  It definitely feels nice to make someone's day though. 
Standing at a subway station in toronto I had an asian girl come up to me and just say "Downsview?" to me. I figured she was mainland Chinese and was either unable or far too shy to speak much English.   Handily I spend a lot of time in China for work and have managed to pick up a good deal of basic mandarin. Her eyes lit up when I started explaining to her in shitty mandarin how to get to Downsview station. A mixture of surprise, happiness and total confusion (I'm a big white guy). Glad I could help her out! 
Haha, he got fake mad at me when she told him, like 'what have you done?? You're making me look bad'. He messaged me afterwards asking me where I learned though, so I think he has realised how much it would mean to her :). 
This is awesome, good job for making random peoples day :D 
Just takes practice! Become fluent at the language! The rest will follow! 
What? How could that ever be racist or ignorant? In school one of the best ways to have a conversation with the international students (or even second gen immigrants) is to talk about their language, their culture, their home because surprise! It's part of who they are.   I wouldn't have thought that Lithuania is particularly interesting or relevant, but because I was able to talk to a Lithuanian about their language and country I found out that their language is the oldest surviving language in Europe, and they have a god damn interesting history.  
Same. I thought it was going to be a TIFU kinda post until I noticed the sub.  
If they end up in reddit, they usually do. I was also very pleasantly surprised. 
Because Russian is far less obscure than Kazakh. Most people probably know a word or two, so it's more of a hassle. Not that your gesture isn't welcome or anything. 
Nah.  Everything he says in that movie is actually Polish 
Also because they can convice voters to vote for them. Regardless of your ideas, you also need to be able to communicate them in such way that the people want you. You need to be good at the political game, which is not just about different opinions but also about making alliances and enemies at the right times with the right people. I think many geniuses have trouble communicating to the "normal" people, so they could never become president. The charisma just isn't there. Let alone that they could dive into the political game. 
What do you mean, "I couldn't be the president of the United States of America"?  Tell me something, it's still "We the people", right? 
Your letting us down cactus!  But I expect to see your name on the ballot next time.  
Hmmm.... I have a pretty nice ficus in my office.  Running mate? 
Is honest and honorable the best thing we should look for in a leader, though? That one character from Game of Thrones got his head chopped off, after all (I don't know how to put things in a spoilers link). 
And almost literally one candidate from every race ever. In the recent decades it's just been the shiniest of two turds. 
He would probably just ask you to vote for Hillary.  
The problem in this election is that the two mainstream candidates are not equally bad.  I dislike Hillary and do not want her to be president, but I think Trump would be an indescribable disaster.  Hildog will have to have a *very* secure lead in the polls before I'll even consider voting 3^(rd) party.  Also, dunno any specifics about Gary Johnson, but the Libertarian party has its own streak of batshit crazy positions that turn many people off. 
Seriously.  Hillary absolutely has the resume for the job, if not the charisma. 
Problem with 3rd party candidates in the US is that they're fringe and can't really get the votes that the major party candidates.  
I got 142 mil from a census... so something in the range of these numbers 
The executive branch employs over 10 million people. It's decidedly more powerful and larger than the legislative branch, despite only a single individual being elected to run the branch. It no longer resembles what the Constitution proscribed.  
As much as I hate to say it, I agree with this line of thinking.   "Meh. I know she'll use the opportunity to line her own pockets but at least she won't wreck the place. And who knows, she might end up throwing us a couple of bones while she's at it." 
It came out steaming hot and it was a light brown (I think it's actually a caramel/vanilla flavor), so it didn't occur to me it might not be coffee. 
Best thing I've read today too. As a white, coffee drinker. 
Drinking straight creamer? More like freshman 150. 
Huh, I started with black tea (no additions), transitioned to shitty coffee drunk black, now consume great freshly burr ground coffee with a little milk to cool it down in the morning, a 200mg pill at noon, another cup drunk black after getting home, a latte in the late evening, and a 3 bag kettle of green tea at night.   Fuck. 
Or if you're like me and never liked caramel, the mocha frappuccino is the same thing but with chocolate instead. It's pretty much a frozen chocolate drink with whipped cream and with a coffee undertone. 
I figured stuff at the cafeteria probably wouldn't be the best, but I could get it free on my meal plan as opposed to dropping $2-3 for every cup. Such is life as a student 
Usually when someone asks me how I take my coffee I say "black and bitter, like my soul". I think I'll switch to this.  
No, but after reading the comments I'm thinking I should give it a go 
This! I've been a daily coffee drinker since I was 12 (now 29) and for a long time, I drank dark roasts exclusively. A couple years ago, I heard that lighter roasts have more caffeine, so I decided to give them a try, and as it turns out, I actually prefer the taste. They aren't just for noobz. 
Heh after reading this my first thought was "man I'd make this guy the best french press coffee"    There will be a day when we just crush the beans and snort them. 
Well, I've left the church I grew up in and it's a "thing" for us apostates to drink the devil's liquid, so I thought I should at least try it.   I really like hot chocolate and would like to able to replace it with something that has fewer calories.   I just like the idea of grabbing a coffee with someone. It's a tradition lots of people do and I'd like to be a part of it.  I don't want it to become an everyday thing though. I just want to get to the point where I don't hate it. 
The search continues. I had a cafe au lait yesterday and it wasn't the most terrible thing ever. Next time I go, I think I'll get a latte. 
The smell keeps me from trying it enough that I've never gotten around to forcing myself to taste it at all. 
I'll probably be trying something along those lines next time I go. 
Or if you want to survive in the office environment you're more than likely studying to participate in in the future, get a Mr. Coffee and some ground coffee.  Yuban if it still exists.  It's second only to the bulk unbranded "coffee" sold at discount/warehouse "stores".  (I'm not saying that's what I drink; it's simply the opposite extreme to the coffee neckbeard philosophy ;) .) 
Not even sure where the nearest Starbucks is. There's a cafe that's popular with the locals and has several locations on campus. I've been getting about one coffee a week for the past few weeks. I've mostly tried different types of drip coffee. Haven't really found anything that clicks yet. 
It was a light brown and I think it's a vanilla/caramel flavor. I haven't had much exposure to coffee, so I just thought a little cream added could make it that color. 
I might do that next time I grab something. I've tried dark/full city roasts so far, but I don't think I've tried a light roast. 
Don't know how I would notice since I don't have access to a scale. Are you talking about my username that's relevant? 
I've tried medium/dark roasts, so I'm thinking next time I want to try something lighter. 
I actually emailed them a couple days ago, so we'll see if they write back. Some people are theorizing it's not actually creamer, but idk. 
I did get some really bad headaches, I just wasn't sure if it was due to other factors. I'll look into it. 
Not a fan of grapefruit, haven't really had the others (except mushrooms, which I like). You're the second person that's posted about that, so maybe I should look into it a bit more. 
Yeah, I realize. One of the reasons I've mostly been trying drip coffee is because there's little/no calories. I'll definitely have to hit the gym more than usual this week. 
I am fine watching just for laughs gags hidden camera show, it rarely embarasses the random person.  It is usually just them seeing something crazy happen.  But I won't watch roasts or shows like punk'd where the idea is to embarass the victim. 
I think one difference between Arrested and The Office is the only sane person in Arrested knows everyone around him is crazy, while the Office has several "normal" people trying to grapple with the oddballs on the show and keep some level of composure while cringing inside.   
I have had to literally get up and leave the room watching Larry David.   
Jackass when they're messing with each other I'm perfectly fine with but when they start messing with random strangers, I can't handle it.  Those guys signed up to look like a fool or have some crazy stuff happen to them on camera.  The average person going about their day did not. 
Phyllis and Bob's wedding is another one. I skip both of those episodes every time. 
The Office UK is beautifully cringey. And by that I mean it's a brutal cringefest.  
Peep Show is the most awkward thing I've ever watched. It hurts to watch, but I love it. 
Yes!! I **hated** those movies for that reason. About twenty minutes in, I assumed Meet the Fokkers (or was that the sequel?) was going to end in murder suicide because no other possible ending could be satisfying.   Then friends made me watch Bridesmaids. I opted to get sloppy drunk because it made me so fucking uncomfortable.  I get embarrassed for them, but when it keeps going I lose all empathy and just flip to this deep, disproportionate rage.  
If Ben Stiller created it, Ricky Gervais has perfected it. The Office was bad, Extras was even worse, and then he went full retard and did a show about a mentally challenged caretaker. I liked the original version of The Office that he did but his other stuff is too much.  
Don't worry about it. Stuffing up and things failing is just part of live theatre. We're all going to head backstage and laugh about it after the lights go down, and it happens all the time. We expect things to go wrong and working round them is part of the show.    
dude whenever I rewatch the dumb starbucks episode(this is my go-to episode that I show people to introduce N4U), I always skip the music parody thing because the cringe is real. 
I clicked on this thread just to mention the Inbetweeners. I love it but it's so painful for me to watch. 
that depends for me.  if the story only involves the five main characters, I can watch it all day.  watch "Reynolds vs Reynolds: The Cereal Defense" for an episode where their assholishness only hurts each other.  it's comfy as fuck.  if the story causes the main characters to terrorize an innocent outsider, it gets a little cringey.  IASIP is nowhere near as reliant on cringiness as other shows mentioned here.  I love it. 
I've loved Louis CK's standup since the 90s, so I kept giving Louie another shot.  Every new season I would watch an episode to see if I or the show had changed.  Every time I'd want to gouge my eyes out.  His standup is still terrific.  Joe Pesci had it completely backwards.  Louis CK should stay far away from TV and movies, and dedicate his whole life to standup. 
I found parks and rec to rely less on cringe humour than the office, at least after the first season. I couldn't handle the office at all, but I loooove parks and rec! 
Thank you. It makes me feel better knowing that so many people are disgusted by this. We have a lovely culture and a big part of it is sharing, we love having guests and making friends. 
Don't believe for a moment that a large portion of the country doesn't want you here. You are a citizen. You are one of us, and you will always be welcome. Don't allow this administration to divide & conquer.  
I became close with a teacher from Iran.  Today he was so sad.  It hurts to see someone like that affected by something so stupid.  
I think every country whose dual citizens are banned should definitely follow suit. This order is an insult to their system of government and status as a sovereign nation.  Literally the fastest way to get this reversed and the easiest method to show Trump the limits of unilateral action in the modern world. Such a great opportunity...  
I spent this morning reading about the Internment camps because I feel like too many people forget that that happened... All the parallels are terrifying. This is the first time I feel unsure about living here :( 
The ACLU filed a suit so hopefully it gets reversed quickly.  
When will the blunt stupidity end?  The people of Iran suffering under the Shah, replaced by the suffering under the Ayatollahs (and their horrifying war with Iraq from 1980-88), the squashing of the peoples' will in 2009 (just like the Shah had done three decades before), and now this republican rabid wet dream of a senseless and ignorant disruptive fiasco, scapegoating and punishing regular decent people for the actions of their government.  All around, miserable bastards making life miserable for others, dragging them into their politics. 
They're due back this week, but now who knows. And my teacher has a blanket 'no late work' policy and the papers are 60% of the grade. I had 100% and have never had a late assignment before. She's not nice. 
The circus is a valid path, I've been training for three years as a back up plan. That comment was only a half joke ha.  I'm sorry to hear that :( I hope your week gets better. 
That's cold, sorry man. It'll take a while, but through a lot of pain you'll come out the other end stronger and better. Keep your head up. 
Steve Bannon tacked on a 90-day ban on permanent residents re-entering the US. The ban is also preventing people who hold dual citizenship (e.g. UK + Iran) from entering the US. 
Ooooh, a date! That's exciting! Whatcha gonna do? And Japanese is so cool! How long have you been learning?  Her name is Athena, but I mostly call her Memow or Queena :) 
Only on people who are already in the US, I think. Meaning all the folks detained at the airports. The new entry ban is still on. 
Do you love your partner? Do you trust them?  Let them know of your desire to be more spontaneous in life. It may be the root of more relationship/personal issues than you think. Also, maybe they will like the idea? You just have to trust and take risks. We don't advance by playing life safe.  
I quit Monday morning and had it all figured out by Wednesday evening. 
You can do it in a safer way.  Look for the new job and then turn things upside down. You don't need to take the risk of simply quitting and being unemployed. 
Can you elaborate on how your travels changed your perspective and gave you purpose? I've heard others say it and never thought to ask.  
What part of NC? If you're rural it's going to be a yuge culture shock. And I mean that.  
Yup! Never having kids because I want to be happy.  
When that brewery opens, reply to this message (if you remember) and let me know when I can drop by for a beer! 
I think most people do. We're all too scared to pull the trigger on either. Hang in there... We're all trying to figure ourselves out.  
San Diego is my dream city. I don't know why you'd ever leave! 
I'm from Portland, is the scene bigger in San Diego? I feel like all I do is drink craft beer. 
"I'm a princess!"  but seriously though, is the duck one a reference joke? 
I upvoted your comment and it said "Thanks, Obama." :D 
Same! It's a lovely virtual atmosphere we have here today. 
I think I'm having deja vu...  Anyway, the Praetorian Guard was the Roman emperor's personal legion. They were responsible for defending the city of Rome and the Emperor himself. However, they were most famous for assassinating emperors. 
You can undo your automatic upvote and re-upvote yourself... for instance, mine is "Yer an upvoter, Harry." 
Lots of people are commenting the messages that appear. 
Looking through the top of all time on this sub, you realize that one of these pops up every once in a while, and everyone loves them.  I think the reason the mods don't delete these is because they take it as a compliment. And, of course, I'm pretty sure /u/GodOfAtheism has a smug he needs to stroke.                
Studies have also been done with other ethnic names, such as traditionally sounding African or Hispanic names, and the same results happen. And any time it's brought up, you basically just get a bunch of people saying, "well parents shouldn't give their children those names because it harms their chances of getting a job." It's pretty sad that the solution seems to be "everyone should have generic whitebread names" instead of "everyone should try to avoid negatively stereotyping people due to their name." 
All I can think of is Ratatouille, the movie. (Remy is the name of a character in the movie: a rat). 
Tinder is where you go to bury both your dick and your faith in humanity, generally speaking. 
Holy shit, that's genius. I will keep that in mind.  
But, I have pictures of me with beer and partying...  
But what's fucked up is that I am getting rejected by girls from my own region. Ahmad should be "known" or "familiar" to them...  But you're definitely right about this Parks and Rec.  
Racial bias is a thing on dating sites as well though, think there's been a few studies done about white people being less inclined to message a black person on dating sites  (not sure about the reverse or how different races affect it)  Familiarity works here but for slightly different reasons. 
I've heard that there is a stereotype in a lot of countries that white women are very promiscuous, due to porn. 
Reminds me of the scam telephone calls where guys with ridiculously strong Indian accents say their name is David from the IRS and you have to pay them for delinquent taxes. 
But like 80% of white americans identify as christian. Would you make the same assumption about them? Or someone with a Jewish last name?   Having an "ethnic" name in reality has very little bearing on how religious you are, since the name is chosen by your parents, it's at most a reflection of your parents' religion. 
I worked with a guy who was named Saddam Hussein right around the time Bush the second was invading Iraq. He introduced himself as 'Saddam' and I winced and went 'Ohh, I bet that's rough.' he just laughed and was like 'Oh, it gets worse, my last name is Hussein.' He was named before the other guy became well known so it was just an unfortunate coincidence.  
Well, it depends on what you mean by racism. Apparently his presumed cultural identity was much more of a barrier than his biological race in this case. 
I don't know. I guess, I thought of it, as my nick name. That way I can joke about it, and say my nick name is Nick, my actual name is Ahmad.    
I totally agree. All the people here saying stuff like "Ahmed is such an unfamiliar name" or "their family is probably too religious for me" like it somehow excuses their behavior is a little ridiculous. I get that it makes people uncomfortable to talk about, so the natural response is probably to redirect the conversation towards something else, but not being able to accept that racism still exists is a big part of the problem. Just accept it and try and be better in the future, that's all you have to do. 
If you are in the US, Mina sounds like a girl's name, so that might be confusing or if putting. 
Travis is definitely not a great choice to attract women.  IMO of course.  Maybe other women think Travis is an amazingly sexy name. 
as a guy called Osama this scares me. To make it worse im an athesit, people will always assume im muslim  
This.  I don't understand how anyone is ignoring this.  Western women don't want to end up converting to Islam, so why waste time meeting someone you'll never want to connect with.  
Yes, because it's totally racist for people from a Western Society to swipe right on Western names more than non-Western names.   The dude lives in Toronto. 
I am from Afghanistan. I have hazel eyes, dark brown hair , and fairly light skin, lighter than eastern Asians (people from Pakistan, India, Srilanka , etc.) Whenever someone tried to guess my background, they always start with" are you Latino?"   
Agent schnebly5 reporting in. I've snuck past the guard and am in the elevator. As I am writing this the elevator stopped and two women got in. They don't seem to be concerned, just a weird look since I'm in a tux. Will report in soon. On the 5th floor.  
Can't tell if you're sarcastic. It's either this or sitting by myself. Remember, this is her prom, not mine. I go to a different school, so I'll have my own prom with people I onow 
Hey dude/dudette you can explore a hotel anytime you want! Most people just end up sitting around at prom, so don't regret not going.  
So you're saying it gets you...    ... Alotta Fagina?  
That sounds exactly like the kind of thing I'm hoping to do in college  
Aww thanks :D that means a lot! Have an awesome day!  
I have the same personality type as Butters: INFP! 
Also, high voltage, so the don't touch anything rule applies.  Actually, the don't get closer than 10' to any equipment rule applies. 
We didn't stay, but I assume if you book a room you can. Never heard of anyone doing that. I stayed over at my girlfriend's house.! 
I KNOW!!! I NEED TO GO BACK AND FIND IT!!!   Also, really thank you for your positive vibes... it's just kind of dizzying right now cause the breakup is a bit messy here and there so it takes some work to close. I really hope you're right about college. If I may ask, are you in college?  
you know me too well! thanks for reading and glad you liked it.  
Thanks for the kind words! I sure hope you're right! 
I've decided not to make any public remarks about where it is for privacy purposes, but that's fucking awesome nonetheless! 
Fellow agent, one of the keys to being stealthy and going places you're not supposed to is the ability to retreat. In my adventures in the hotel, I had a few "safe spots" where I *knew* nobody would find me (e.g. this little nook on the F1 staircase on the 6th floor). So each time I went a little further in the ladder room and sensed danger, I knew I had a place to fall back to. It's like guerrilla warfare.  
Very much appreciate the offer but its ok, get yourself a game and thanks alot!:) 
I feel like there's a deeper meaning to this that I'm just not getting (ignoring the fact that it's random words) 
I'm in my early 20's & I've already got a gray. :(  I call it Gandalf. 
... and you smell like one too.  I always sing this version! 
It was Super Smash bros for the 3ds :P and thanks alot!:) 
Thanks! A friend of mine has a birthday real soon, I'll try make his birthday awesome 
I hope you still had a great day! Happy birthday. :) 
My first Christmas away was tough too.  I went into severe depression because I felt alone in the city/world. 
Thanks for the response mate, very much appreciate it :) 
Have a great birthday on Friday Jai! However you choose to spend it  
I feel your pain. My birthday is on Christmas Day :( 
I imagine it's more about the lack of thought from friends and family.   More about the lack of presence than the lack of presents. 
Hello I had a nightmare last night and I woke up having a sinus lol and I woke up late. But I didn't want to ruin my day because of that and forget about my blessings so I just wanted to be happy.  I also have lot of things to do today so if I'm not in good mood I won't be able to do them.   
There is always time for a nice change. It's gonna change trust me. Thank you (: 
Wow, that is great news!  It's def great to be recognized and appreciated.    Have a fun weekend!  
It will for sure.  I woke up today sick and I had a nightmare but I didn't want to ruin my day because of that so I started my day by smiling.  And I believe that if you smile for people, which is free of charge, you may change someone's day and make him happier 
Best of luck  Do not overthink about that Just try your best. You can do it 
Oh that look very relaxing I would love to have a bottle of cold corona but I'm not allowed to drink beer for a month You can still have one beer but not over drinking  
Everyday I try to wake up early cause I have lot of things to do but I've never been able to open my eyes lol Now it's noon and I'm still having my cup of tea (I've been holding it for 30 minutes)    
Wow  I'm happy for you Well I weighted myself today and noticed that i lost 4.5 lbs so I'm happy about that But I haven't done anything important yet Thank you for asking 
You can be happy by controlling your mind and your thoughts Count your blessings and don't compare your life to any other's life 
are you in an "odd" time zone or you just work nights? 
I'm glad I made it better. I wish that can wake up early as you do 
Hello I'm sorry for my late reply How was your date? I hope it went well! 
Send a wide text to your inlaws politely asking them to remember time zones and give them an easy way to think about it - for example, "subtract 3 hours from the current time. If it's before _AM, call us later". Be sure not to name names so nobody can get butthurt about it. :) 
I have a memoire to write too but I haven't started yet Some motivation are definitely needed 
It's good to hear that I'm happy for you What's next? What are you going to do? I'm still working on my final-year project  
Hope you feel better and all the best for your exams!  
It could be worse I hope the rest of your day will be better 
Happy birthday! Do all the things that make you happy! Whether it's indulging in ice cream or just having a quiet day! Have a good one! 
Oh my God!! I'm sorry about your cousin I'm glad I made you smile for a lil bit 
Good luck for your exams and I hope you'll feel better by tomorrow I'm having a sinus too 
Thank you so much I hope you have lot of happiness and love in your life too 
You can do it Have a cup of coffee maybe it will help   
My day is going well. It's a normal day for me  I Hope that tomorrow you'll wake up with a positive energy  
Well that's good to know that you day went better (: 
Ofc you don't really care. That's normal cause I'm a stranger to you.  But I think that you could have been nicer while posting a comment or maybe just ignore it and don't make a comment at all isn't it? Cause I'm sure that you wouldn't like to see someone talking to you that way Anyway whatever made you angry, I hope you'll pass through it 
Word for word:   "Hey crush how was your spring break?"  "It was great luke, how was yours?"  "Pretty good. Hey I was wondering if you'd want to hang out sometime? Like not at school but maybe go do something fun?"  "What do you mean?"  "I'm asking you out, do you wanna go on a date sometime?"  Pause, she started blushing  "Yes"  The rest I don't really remember I was too excited 
You sound like my mom whenever I go out with friends lol 
I'm not sure yet, but someone on here suggested the zoo and that sounded perfect 
"Nice shoes. Did your dad buy them?"   Haha, cracked me up thinking of OP saying that.  
I always think long term with this stuff, even if I am only 20. Its just what I want. Thanks for this, hadn't considered it 
Nothing yet. I forgot what happens after you get a yes hahaha 
I do really like this girl, and I'm not gonna try to hide that. I know how to handle myself and not come off as clingy or desperate. 
She actually came up and did the "Hi!" thing to me. I hadn't even noticed this girl until she did that and every day since that day we've talked more and more. It works, you just have to be relaxed about it. I know what it's like to talk to a girl you know very little about yet are completely infatuated with. Stop acting like you're defusing a bomb, and just relax.  
Trouble makers don't ask permission to be bad. They just do it. 
When you told her about it, how did you pronounce it? I've read the word Doge so many times but never heard it out loud.  
and I'm Soli, I love ice creams, video games, and boobs. 
I'll be that one bloke where the family is sizzlin some snags and I come by  and hav em uninvited. Everybody knows that one bloke 
Even if she isn't - Happy Mother's Day from the US and /u/tatertot255 internet friends :) 
I was thinking the same thing! *sweats* The pressure is on! :) 
We wish you both an amazing mothers day and weekend! :) 
When my wife and I were dating,  I would get the door for her then walk around the car and rip a fart I had been holding.  
That is literally what OP said... Why was it upvoted over 400 times? 
I was thinking more Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm  
Oh wow - I bought a used car 1 1/2 years ago.  It is a nice car but i never knew why is is all scratched up near the door handle!  I bet it is from the previous owners wedding ring or rings his ex-wife used to wear!  Thank you for solving this mystery for me!  I had my old car for 14 1/2 years and there were no scratches near the door handle at all! 
Heck, it's helped towards me GETTING a girlfriend before. 
When I started dating this one girl, she slammed the crap out of the door when I picked her up for our first date. I did the same thing as OP and pretty much opened the door her every time we got in my car. For two years. *sigh...* 
My car's windows are the same way. I just roll them down as I come to a stop when letting someone out (you know, for air) so that they have nothing to push on.  
I can think of one or two other things that are wrong with society before this.  Use of the word "peeps" is one of them.  
Yeah, I don't know if they weren't aware or what, it isn't like YouTube has any knowledge of Google /s 
dicks.com goes to dickssportinggoods.com  how long ago was this? 
I mean there is a lot to keep up with,  so I know it can be confusing.  I know people in the tech industry that have trouble keeping up.  
I think there are plenty of like stories, this one just made me laugh 
I work in a bike shop, and was helping a customer track down a replacement part for an old bike rack [for their car] made by Saris.  It took me a little while to realize why a search for "Saris models" resulted in a bunch of pictures of hot Indian women. 
Thats a classic. Thats a prime example of getting all of the possible URLs for something before you go public with it. That guy resisted a long time in giving it to the government IIRC 
Some moms enjoy porn.  Not all moms are prudes.  \#NotAllMoms 
Reminds me of my father. He always blames the companies for making stuff stupid, when in reality it is him who did something stupid with the stuff. 
You spend a lot of time on the facebook, so I know you know a lot about computers.... 
Redbox sounds like a very specialised porn site (I'm assuming shark week porn is a thing). 
Mine did this too, but with hotmale instead of hotmail 
It didn't help that your screensaver was a game of Ms Pacman 
The problem is, if you show them, and they have trouble grasping those things they'll just end up doing more damage in the long run. 
... Who cares if you know what porn is?  Also, in the story, the woman opens with the name RedTube the next day, rather than OP mentioning the name first. 
I WOULD PAY, BUT GOOGLE ISN'T INTERESTED IN THE CANADIAN MARKET. 
So did you Redtube with her that night? If so... Link? 
Yeah with their Racism, Xenophobia, Sexism and ruining out economy and blaming us!   No they are adorable though 
I'm not even mad... that's impressive AF, he knows how to use all of those applications/ devices (albeit not efficiently)  
Will your gaming forum still be open?      *senpai don't kill me* 
Terribly sorry, I'm afraid I represent the new wave of Reddit with our weird clothes and shitty music. :P  I do hope things go back to normal... but from what I understand, especially for /r/IAmA, recovering from this is a pretty herculean task. It seems like they were (to be a little bit unkind) somewhat *too* reliant on a single individual to keep a subreddit of millions running. 
Oh no. How ever will I be able to look at gaming memes and GTA gifs? 
Plz don't leave us ;_;  Seriously though, all this shutting down of subreddits means that its actually *harder* for people to get the relevant information. As a means of protest, I kind of feel like its somewhat self-defeating in some sense, as nobody can see *why* they've shut themselves down. 
Conspiracy theory right there. I like it.  Wait, I mean, I don't like Reddit going dark. 
It was summer vacation. The subreddit was up for a little while before it was again made private in protest. 
Voat was created long before its ISP shut them down, and they got shut down because they use servers based in Germany  
I was thinking about going out today, but I think I'll just stay home and take in all this juicy drama 
I dunno, I've seen shitstorms on Reddit before but they've always been just people complaining about admin actions... This on the other hand? /r/IAmA was one of the key components of the Reddit community as a whole. With that gone, and apparently with the likelihood of it being unable to recover? This feels far more serious than the usual controversies.  
Some rumors say that all reddit employees had to relocate to the Bay Area, and Victoria might not have wanted to move from NYC, which is a possibility. 
I hate to sound discriminatory, but I'd really rather not associate with Channers. xD Redditors at least can have a decent, mature conversation on the odd ocassion :P 
You got banned for being subbed to what subreddit Did they tell you that?  
Basically, it means that only mods and pre-approved members of that subreddit can entire it.  For the default subreddits and other major subreddits, it means that for all intents and purposes the subreddit has been shut down.  
I disagree. I don't think we should seriously consider suggestions from food that discriminates based on race. 
THE MODS DID NOT BETRAY US, REDDIT BETRAYED THE MODS... 
I think that's the whole point. "Make the changes we want, or kiss your user base (and profits) good bye".  Of course, it can backfire - for example, admins can simply fire the current mods, and put newer, more compliant ones. So.. meh. I don't really involve myself with this sort of politics. 
Sounds kind of ridiculous to me as well. Victoria is an employee of a company, who got fired. Which happens all the time at companies. 
well, i feel sympathy for anyone who is suddenly unemployed.  that shit is hard and i don't wish it on anyone for any reason.  but reddit's response?  i don't know what world most of reddit lives in, but people losing their jobs happens all the time in mine  wanna "show solidarity" with her?  pay her rent, car payment, keep her refrigerator stocked with food, generally keep life normal for her kids if she has any, pay her medical bills and help her find work  LOL  human nature being what it is, its much easier to post pics decrying the unfairness of it all 
It's big news. I heard it got mentioned on Finnish prime time news, and there's a BBC article on their website right now.  
Christ all might they're coming in hard and fast aren't they? I'll add them to the list. 
Wonderful to hear what OP has done with collecting donations of peanut butter.  I agree that doing something you associate with your loved one definitely helps you feel closer to them. My Grandpa loved family gatherings like summer bbqs and was adamant that we not have a funeral for him. Instead we had one last family camp out and BBQ before spreading his ashes.  We also spent the evening teaching my SIL how to roast hot dogs and make s'mores over the fire because she'd never done it before. Since Grandpa was the one that taught most of us how to roast hot dogs and marshmallows over the camp fire in the first place I know that he would've approved.   
Yep. You can pretty much live off of peanut butter. Lots of everything you need, especially in a starvation situation. 
I thought about it, but decided that would seem too forward. 
Could be :) I'll run it by my mom. Thanks for your condolences. 
My dad was buried with one too haha also a spoon. Thanks for your support :) 
I hope you get something truly delicious and wonderful to eat tomorrow that makes you happy.  
Came to say exactly all of this. OP, your grandpa had really awesome taste! There really is no better peanut butter. I think opening a new jar of it and taking the first scoop might be one of the best feelings ever (yes I love PP PB that much). Sounds like your grandpa's greatness attracts other great people, what a fun legacy to leave behind :) 
No experience is more like it. A Tarot card reader is wayy over the top.  
Maybe the tarot actually said "you will have a baby with a man whom you should not be with", in which case it would have been incredibly accurate though completely not what she expected 
When I tell people my family is crazy everyone tells me "ahah, yeah, we all have crazy families".    
Yes, that's sad. I'm sorry your mom gave you a hard time. And congratulations on putting yourself trough college. I'm 29 and I quit college in my last year, years ago.  
Yeah, it really pissed me off too, being a total skeptic. 
Always glad to at least make people happier with their family. 
Believe me, they've already given us both plenty of complexes. 
No, no, my sister is blonde, skinny and cute.   Her only problem is her shitty family.  Not super religious. My mother believes in something undefined while my dad is into all that pagan, esoteric stuff. 
Yeah. Well, in Portugal people in general take things a bit more serious. We don't really have the concept of "dating" here.  
Oh, it does. Thank you. My mom told me just yesterday that God basically gave her money to buy cigarettes, so... 
Well, in our family we are used to the weirdness. She just kind of conforms to it, while I get pissed off all the time. 
I think she'll do fine. We've been dealing with this sort of craziness our whole lives. 
Well, I can't say you're wrong. Just less wordy than "this guy she had been seeing for a month". 
I get that all the time.  I just had this stupid argument with my Dad where he was going through some fox news rant about the medical profession, and insisted I had been on ritalin as a kid, which gave me a funny eye twitch, when I distinctly remember my mom *rejecting* ritalin and putting me on some weird, no-artificial-colors-or-preservatives diet.  The eye twitch was just from my being a jumpy kid who was nervous about everything.  And my mom, when she was alive, was a wild-eyed, unquestioning Rush Limbaugh disciple.  I don't know where the hell I learned any critical thinking skills, because it wasn't from anyone in my family. 
Doesn't mean they wouldn't marry and stuff. I mean, I guess they didn't.  
Not really a small town. Suburbs of Lisbon. Small minds, though. 
She isn't, actually. She has actually become pretty mature in recent years.  
Me and her are both weird in our ways, though. How could we not? 
I often say my parents shouldn't have had children. We're really not the sanest. 
Too be honest, I thought her boyfriend was an asshole from the beggining.    
I don't know. He believes that kind of stuff. Always worried about spells and demons and shit. 
I have been in the same relationship for 10 years. They had no chance to.  
Is that right? Because everytime I hear a Tarot story around here (Portugal) there's always related to someone putting a spell on you. 
I don't think so. I think they just don't know how to deal with her being sad about it.  
He's serious. He has exorcized his house once or twice. 
I understand your bias, but it isn't made up. I'd have nothing to gain from it other than imaginary points. 
Well, I think. I wish I could spend more time with her and be more of an influence.  
Oh man, sure. They gave me terrible advice all the time. I had insomnia since I was little and I'd be scared of sounds and shit. They'd tell me it was demons out to get me because we had too many religious books in the house (we were Jehova Witnesses at the time). 
She's bummed out about the guy because she liked him. But it will pass. It's normal! That's the thing. It's normal life.  
Oh, so that's why I hear that bass groove every morning when I wake up. 
Apparently around here it's more of a mix of different things. I believe their only goal is to get money from people, anyway. 
Nah, she's attractive. And It wasn't the first one. 
That's really bad parenting. I'm glad you're doing great :) 
Not to mention the girl knew his ex so she was probably her friend he tried asking out. Hmmmm 
Yeah, makes sense. I don't reckon it was the smartest thing I did - it certainly was a rebound, but I figured I'm never going to see her again and just asked.   It is me time now - getting back to working out, playing Zelda on my Switch, and work! 
I do think I'm acting like I've moved on more than I have - but ever since I found out my ex has moved on too I figured it's pointless for me to keep thinking about what was.  
Thanks man! And I'm sure you'll do fine - no first time is easy, but you've got this.  I'm actually pretty terrible at driving - I live in a country with great public transport and never really had to learn when I was younger, but as a 22 year old who is a bad driver, I regret not working on it sooner.  
I'm likely never to meet her again - she lives in Paris and I live a couple of hours away. I had asked her if I could ask her on a date when I'm in Paris next week for work.  But we did spend the rest of the evening hanging out and it wasn't terribly awkward - so not the best, but not the worst. 
It sometimes feels like an ego thing - like should I move on because she has too? I don't even know if I want to date now, but I want to entertain the idea that I still can date. 
True, I think I'll just play it easy - but it does feel nice knowing if I want to, I can get out there again. :) 
Thanks - that's awesome to know! I figured I won't get to see the girl again and if I was going to try some time, I might as well now. It was only afterwards I felt like I'm getting over my old relationship.  
I sometimes wonder if I would have moved on if she hasn't - but I feel this is for the best. I don't really want to get back into a relationship right away, but I do want to know that I can! 
Pretty much the same happened to me, minus the catching up with the friend. Cheers to you mate! 
Haha I love them too! I'm most likely gonna get to meet them, and I'm so excited for it! I'm not that great, and it's my first time playing in front of such a big crowd, so I hope I don't mess up ! :p 
No, not one bit! My family was generally very supportive of my dreams, it's just that financial problems held me back more than anything. Before my grandfather passed, he always told me that as long as I'm doing good in classes and behaving in school, he'd buy me whatever I wanted. I've never taken advantage of it, but it was always nice to know that even though we were a middle class family, he'd look out for me regardless. 
Haha thanks for the tips man, I kinda figured half that stuff out though :p The crowd is an under 18 crowd, and they only enjoy very coherent music, so my set's pretty precise when it comes down to it ; progressive house, big room, and a bit of future bass / house. 
Hahaha that first line was hilarious  And thank you, I'm only 16 and these types of events happen every so often and I was luckily chosen to open up for them, so although it's not such a big opportunity, it's a huge step in the right path :) 
It'a never too late to chase your dreams, just call it a hobby and roll with it! And thank you haha , im so excited for tonight ! 
Yea, they're great ! What work did they do for LoL? 
Aw! You showed him :) Fuckin' grandpa, always being such a sarcastic samuel.  
Haha thank you! DJing is definitely an expensive hobby and you have to be really sure that you want to do exactly that in the future, or else that's a lot of money down the drain.  Used equipment / second hand / etc is great, but you have to be careful where you buy it from. Lol but thank you again :) 
Yea, getting the ball rolling in the crowd is definitely not the easiest task. Lots of things can go wrong, and the people that say that are generally the people that I don't like to associate with, hahaha.  But more importantly, springs for legs. I can sit on a wheelchair and still DJ and shake headliners' hands, but if I have hand-chainsaws, then I can't shake any hands and I ruin every piece of equipment I touch! 
Haha man, thank you so much for that. It's a very small accomplishment tonight, but it's a foot in the door for my DJ career. 
4* and like I said, I'm opening for them at an Under 18 event, so the promoters couldn't hire any adult openers, because that would kind of defeat the purpose. 
Haha yes! Them mocking me just made me want to be a huge DJ so I can show them what I'm made of! :p 
Thank you man! Never give up on that dream, no matter how hard it seems, just keep trying and pushing and getting yourself out there. I'll try to keep my ear out for it, but get ready for new music! I'll ask them a few more questions about it and I'll update the whole post tomorrow, I promise!  
Thank you man! The first thing I can tell you is to just get your name out there! Make a few different 30 minute mixes, different genres, songs, etc. Then email a bunch of clubs, promoters, facebook pages for events, and ask if theyre looking for opening DJs. Don't send them that mix unless they ask, and personalize your email so it doesn't sound robotic and stuff. Most importantly though, have fun with it! 
Haha seriously ! I'm trying to reply to all of the comments but this hit the front page on my reddit at least, and I can't believe it haha 
Hahahaha! That comment had me rolling in laughter for a good few minutes. I love that man, that's hilarious :p   Guess it's DeanTheDJ - 1 / Dada Life - 0 for now, huh? Haha 
Well, that's your opinion and I can't bash you for disagreeing with mine, but to me this is a huge step in the right direction for what I want to do in the future. 
Haha that would be great, but I can't play any Dada Life tracks in my set, their manager would put a damn hit on me lol 
Thank you :) I'm sure she didn't mean it in a rude way, though, but it still stuck with me for a while. 
That's awesome! I think you should just do you regardless of what your parents say. Mind sharing some of your work? :) 
Check my post edit, I just edited answering a few questions :) 
No way! Haha which one man? :p  Edit : Wow, I'm dumb. Haha I loved that preview man! I used to listen to it on repeat for a few days after it came out, trying to picture how the whole song would go. Seriously dude, that's some good stuff !  
Haha yea, me and the promoter that booked me are really chilled out now so I look forward to the future :) 
Thank you! EDM production is such a hard task to get started with, but once you know what you're doing (which takes forever to learn), it's pretty much smooth sailing, while you gradually learn more and more things to advance your music. Head on over to /r/EdmProduction and you can ask some questions about the stuff :)  If you'd like to begin producing, a well known software that will probably never go obsolete is FL Studio. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me :p 
When I was 12, prior to wanting to become a DJ, I went to Israel where I first started hanging out with my cousin more and generally becoming close with him. He was a DJ at the time, and I used to play around on his turntables and have fun with it, though I was just horrible haha. When I returned to the US, I developed a love for music and DJing, and at that point is when I started getting more intimate with music, both in DJing and production. My advice is to just keep going at it, learn your turntables in and out, look up different routines and techniques, look up your turntable model on youtube and add "mix" to the end, and you'll generally find live mixes with people, and watch what they do and how they do it, and try to mimic that at first, but slowly after time, you'll develop your own style. Most of all, just have fun with it! It's music man, don't take it TOO seriously :P 
Thanks man! Everything went so well, I'll be posting an update tomorrow! 
Thank you so much! I appreciate it, and I loved doing the set :) 
Haha good luck being a writer man, I hope to see DJArctic's novel coming out soon :p  At the venue I used the club's CDJ2000s with their DJM 400 mixer, I believe. There was an amazing sound system, and that's all that matters haha, it sounded great in the booth and in the crowd. 
Don't let it get to your head. At the end of the day, you're the most important thing in your life. Never take someone's opinion to heart that you didn't ask for. If you need anything or wanna talk in general, feel free to pm me :)  
Thank you :) I'm pretty nervous as well as excited, so I need all the luck I can get hahaha. 
You're doing god's work, son.  Compensating your work now. 
Haha it will and I'm so excited! I remember listening to Dada Life and thinking to myself, "holy crap I wish I could be like them one day" when I was like 14, and I guess this more or less gets pretty close :p 
You mean you finished listening to one of their songs? Which one? And thanks ! :) 
It's never too late to try again! Get yourself out there, grab life by the balls, and say "HEY, FUCKFACE, IM YOUR UMF 2016 HEADLINER." 
Never be scared to do it! Go to your local music shop and look around. Turntables don't cost that much. I use controllers, but a decent pair of turntables plus a mixer will set you back maybe $300 / $400. Look into it, keep looking, keep looking, and keep looking ! Look for used equipment, old donation equipment, etc. Don't get discouraged from trying out something you know you'd love because of money issues, man! 
Someone downvoted, but I upvoted you back to neutral state. Your opinion is your opinion man. If I do what I love, what's it to you? 
Well, I had actual friends celebrate with me when we were all at the party, but I decided telling the internet would be cool too. But hey, fuck me right? 
I'm friends on Facebook with a guy in LA that was friends with my friend in DC. We've never met but we tag each other in posts and exchange pictures of us clasping hands together in increasingly complicated poses.  
I would absolutely try that chat function! Wouldnt you hate it if she dissappeared and you wouldnt know anything about her? 
Damn I'd love a job like that. Not about circumcision in particular, but being paid to go on impassioned rants. 
My name isn't super common but common enough that the person with my firstnamelastname gmail was taken. So mine is firstnamealastname (middle initial). I emailed her once when I was job searching at the end of college just to let her know that I was job searching and sorry in advance if anyone emailed her by mistake but please forward it to me if she didn't mind. She responded that my aunt sometimes emails her. 
I'm actually in the same boat. I've got a friend that I still talk to through last.fm after 5+ years. We have JUST started mentioning the possibility of Skyping in the near future.  It's a really interesting phenonmena when reflecting on it. 
Search for him! See if he's still doing soccer. :) 
I love how online gaming destroys social barriers. I used to play eve, small gang combat, we had a pirate outfit, and it was real trial by fire stuff. If you didn't kill 10 times more players than you died, you would lose money and not be able to afford losses.   in our gang we had a 70yr old Norwegian guy, and a 12 yr old Australian kid, we respected their skill and ability equally.  
Dank meme buds, or regular meme buds?  Also, sorry to hear it went the creepypms route. 
Opposite gender platonic relationships seem increasingly rare, because it seems to me that guys and girls are pressed to "be with" anyone that likes them as a person. I'm glad you've got her, and I know I'm glad to have my three main girl friends who I know wouldn't ever date me. Good on you, and I hope things stay good between you two. 
I'm reading this as a support group for the now-adult babies who get brought up when the naming statistics come out since they have truly ~~shitty~~  semi-unique names, like abcedef, etc.    I love it  =D 
That reminds me of another friend I have.  Before Facebook got really strict on names, I made a joke account of John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt (spelling?). I searched, and found another one. I messaged "Your name is my name too!".  We messaged back and forwarth for two years before learning our real names (her name is not my name too) and many years later we're good friends who confide in each other. We have yet to meet in person. 
how did you write her name on your back with a sharpie?  
That's awesome!  I wasn't a very good pen pal.  After about 6 months, I'd get busy and lose interest.  I still think about them on occasion ... 
Exes who you can remain on good terms with often make the best of friends, I have found.  There's a certain trust that can't be found elsewhere. 
Sounds like my family, except im an honorary canadian, not a real one 
I've been friends with a lot of people where all I really do is *listen*.  It gives them a chance to get everything off their chest, and try to find a solution to their problems. 
I never get any messages or voicemail by accident :( maybe I should get a new phone number, one that seems easy to mistype, lol 
I've had something like that.  I had one person on OKC that was a 99% match globally that lived across the earth from me and we would just chat about really random stuff occasionally until I got off the site for good a couple years ago. 
Thanks.   They actually named me godfather of their kid, even though I've only ever facetimed with the kid. 
That's an awesome story, and sounds like a great friendship.  I'm sure you'll find him someday. :) 
I have a few friends from minecraft that I have put in many hundreds of hours playing that damn game with them. Like 800+ at least. We would occasionally do build projects for big servers and that took lots of time  
Same situation except we're both only mostly straight and a bit bi 
You both have your own statues?!? :P  What's a battle rapper though? 
I've been friends with someone for four years and never met her. Hope I can someday though. 
I love that, do you remember any of the stand out names? 
That's awesome, I wish my library hosted board game nights.  
Hey! Weird (and possibly self destructive) stuff happens sometimes. Is everything okay, though? Do you want to talk about the situation? Feel free to PM me. :) 
Were you a gym leader, or a pokemon? Which one(s)? 
I totally agree about the Anime, it's weird how I'm fine during the saddest scenes in normal film/tv but the moment that slow piano marks the beginning of a sad scene in an Anime, the waterworks begin. 
Sometimes we forget that they also age. I can't and don't want to imagine a world without my dad or my mom, but of course it's inevitable. All we can do for the time being is cherish them and let them know that we care and love them. Once they are gone, you won't live your life thinking that you could have done more. 
I am so very sorry for your loss.   *Nana internet hug* 
We meet again!  I warned you when I added you as friend. This *will* happen! 
*Nana internet hug*  Let the emotion flow - it's a good thing :) 
Can I get a hug too? :'( let's all have a hug party.  ^(lost my dad recently)  
I am so very sorry for your loss. Maybe you weren't a very good son as you think; however, we generally are much too self-critical when it comes to our own actions. I'm thinking he not only loved you but thought well of you too.  You take care.   *Nana internet hug* 
I'm really sorry about that. I'm old enough to know that some things just can't be fixed, but it's still upsetting since I grew up thinking that my parents were very much in love and happy. I have actually spent a lot of time with my dad. He's the one that's hurt the most and definitely needs the company.  
Oh no, I'm not trying to side with anyone but I've just been more close with him as of late because it's been a lot harder for him. I'm not saying that my mom isn't upset but I know she's not as upset as he is. He's trying to end things on a good note, despite her being extremely rude, but she's just not having it.  
Same here! I've also had romantic crushes turn into these. Once all the "OMG DATE ME" feelings had faded cause it didn't look like it was going any further, it became a "man, they're really really cool. I wish we were closer."   I'm pretty good at getting close to people, but terrible at convincing myself to make the first couple moves. I've got the tricks up my sleeve, just lack the confidence to pull them outta my sleeve! I wonder how close we would've gotten if I just tried a little harder. Oh well. Better luck next time, right? 
I've heard of the term "squish" before for non romantic crushes but I never connected why it was called that till now. Thanks mate :) 
People and socialization is scary. As generic as the thing Im going to say now, it does get better with time. Do one thing every day which would help you with it :) 
This whole sub is generally wholesome. It's basically /r/WholesomeMemes before /r/WholesomeMemes were a thing. 
I'm Catholic and I learned about platonic love from being friends with people who had taken chastity vows and it was one of the best things I've learned.   
Thats definitely a tricky one, such a shame that there needs to be immediate assumptions when it comes to socialization between girls/guys.  
Aww! Don't worry. I guess I just kinda merged myself into conversations etc? Isn't that easy I know. Took me a year and a half in my last school, but ended up being so worth it. Making good friends is such a trial and error kind of process. However though, just be nice to her and be the kind of person you'd want to get to know :) Have you ever talked to her/how do you know her anyway? 
This is very true, making friends is tricky lol. But seems like you're doing a well good job, through working with them you can probably seep in some bonding conversations. :)  
Never really had it either. Sure, I have plenty of times when I'm like hey he seems to be a cool dude I should try to talk to him more. But to get really excited about the idea of befriending them? Not really. 
Yeaaah, genuinely compassionate/kind people really catch my eye also, I really look for that 
This is actually how I met my best friends a decade back!! It also felt like that at first - that they were nice and all but I wasn't really in the group - but that changed after awhile. I think some of them are still closer because of the history, but it definitely changed a lot from the beginning and they've been such great best friends that they've given me high standards (and faith!) in people :) 
yeh in a time constraint you say it, those exact words, and how you feel, knowing the person so far. works ervytyme. thyre gone aneewe lol beteer next book and theatre person 
They're like mental practice that won't happen exactly that way. 
Maybe he thought that you were really trying to get to know him 
don't get discouraged, it's usually nothing personal and has to do with them! I mean yeah it is literally personal, but it has to do with what they think, and that's based on their experiences etc.  I actually met my incredible best friend group a decade back putting myself out there (basically at this event together and I said that my friends' table was full - sorta true - could i sit with them? and then i just kept doing that whenever that larger friend group got together, and then i invited them to hangout personally) 
I personally feel like I don't naturally have a lot to add to a friendship, and that I could but it would take a lot of effort.   Like, I would feel under pressure to be interesting/cool/funny whatever. 
Same, but this thread is making me change my mind. 
Damn I don't get this on mobile !!   sounds satisfying  
remembers me "the beginning of the end of the beginning has begun" 
You heard correctly! I'm giving them away at least. 
Mobile doesn't have fancy stuff like pictures in flairs, special up/downvote buttons or messages. 
Nothing. Its chilled, people are nice. Thats about it.   Welcome :)  
Exactly! I love when someone takes that second to upvote something I've said. 
That's what I've been trying to do! Haha I've upvoted every single comment and replied to probably 75% of them. I'm about to go to sleep though so I'll have some catching up to do.  
I'm really glad you did that, too, because it helped me find dropped threads easier.  It's Shiva's birthday today. Wanna tell her anything or wish her a happi birthday? Promise I'll tell her :D 
Ooh, I'm gonna start doing that too! Why did I never think of it.  
If someone upvotes something I've said or posted, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. (It's the little things!) I'm trying to learn to return the favor. 
Exactly why I've made it my mission to upvote more posts and comments. 
Believe it or not, I just wanted to share my revelation about how terrible I am at upvoting. I was shocked when I woke up and the thread had over 2k upvotes. 
I used to deliver mail for my university as a works study. Really casual with us all taking turns delivering mail and doing homework. One day I found a girl's wallet in one of the mail bags. Had her ID and about $100, cards and normal stuff. I go back to the mail office and find her sitting at one of the desks with her friends doing homework. I ask her if it's hers and she yanks it out of my hand and glares at me without a word.  Sorry for returning your wallet I guess. 
Ugh I once did that: accidentally bumped another car, and left my contact info. Then they tried to screw me over, sending me huge estimates for way more than the damage could possibly cost, and claiming additional damage that I know I didn't cause.  
Yes, cashing paychecks isn't a long term solution because they will garnish from the source eventually. I've never found an organisation that would turn down an offer to remedy bad debt somehow if you offer to work with them. 
Wow, fantastic story! The shipping part made me laugh. Good for you for mailing cash back!  
That, too, happened to me once. Wallet turned in to lost and found, minus the $80. At the time, I felt grateful to have my cards and told myself that person must need the cash more than me. Anger would've been a wasted emotion.   Although, I clearly am not the most responsible with wallets if this has happened to me twice. Chain wallet, here I come! ;) 
I've dropped my wallet countless of times here in Vegas and people always point it out to me if they notice it. I've never forgotten it though.  
Well thank you, but my lenders disagree with you!  
No, I was shaking from a panic attack (long drive back there, freaking out) combined with shock, relief, gratitude... I could not speak except to say "thank you! Thank you soooo much!" But I ought to go back there and make it known how grateful I am! 
That's very sweet, but there are far more deserving folks out there than me!  
Yes! Same here! When I found a wallet, I tracked the person down and returned it in tact! It's just the right thing to do!  
Taiwan is literally the best. Everyone is so chill and nice there.   
Its fairly common for people to throw this around especially young people who haven't been touched by it. I just try to chalk it up to that. Good comment though. I had just decided to let it go.  
Thanks! I celebrated with lasagna and carrot cake!  
I know, it didn't occur to me either! Literally down to the last penny.  
I wish I knew who it was so I could reward them!   One time I found a wallet outside my apartment, looked up the kid on Facebook, and he came to pick it up. He nervously looked in it to see his $300 still inside, and the look of relief that flushed over his face was payment enough. I was super broke at the time  (hmm, a pattern is emerging here, maybe my life choices could be better), but it didn't even occur to me to take any.   So maybe this is that karma returning to me. :) Thanks, universe!  
Thank you! That's a good idea! My ex offered me use of his safe but... yeah, not a great idea for a plethora of reasons.  
Haha, yeah, I'd be the only one with  $400 in my offshore account! Yes, going forward I can and will set up a payment plan to prevent it from happening again. It's just... I scrambled so hard to save that, and now my escape plans are dashed. Just feels like a punch in the face. Totally my fault, it just sucks.  
Thanks. I would have had more options had I not ignored the letters. Totally my fault. Turns out living in denial doesn't solve your problems!  
Hell yea cheapest place to buy groceries here. I don't shop anywhere else unless they don't have something. 
Thank you for your kind words and kind offer. I appreciate it!  
Hmm, that's so odd! Maybe you just have amazing taste in no resale value stuff! "Forget the cash, she has an eos ball in honeydew!"  
I have not, but I will look into it, thank you! That payment amount is awfully affordable!  
Whoah, awesome story! Thank you for your goodness!  
Yeah, great point. Probably not the best word choice. I should have said I felt violated.  
Well, we have a governor who gutted the program, so his (any many other's) benefits went way down. It's terrible.  
Thanks for being honest! It shouldn't be a shocking thing!  
Yeah, for sure, wish I would've jumped on that ship years ago.  
Holy mother of love, I'm so sorry. I can relate to the total emptiness/betrayal/horror/fear that action brings. Sending love and light that your situation takes a turn for the better soon!  
Wowwww! Props to you! You could've taken the money and felt guilty about it, but you did the right thing and still got the money!  
This is a very good day for all compassionate human beings.  
A lot of people are saying on twitter that they'll be moving to Canada.. but they legalized gay marriage in 2005! That'll be a surprise. But seriously I want to see what the reaction is from the more conservative or religious individuals. :) 
It was declared a constitutional right by the Supreme Court.  Supreme court issues don't get voted on by the public.  Any same-sex ban at the state level is now illegal federally.   edit// yo, don't downvote the parent, they asked a legit question  
well have another congratulations from a random stranger.  Enjoy every bit of it from this moment on. :D 
As a straight Briton, this in no way applies to me, but this is still great news to me! A nation as great as the U.S. embracing marriage equality must surely have ripples across the world - and I sincerely hope they are good ripples. 
My first thought is that this decision came down today to hide the TPP.  Hopefully this is a coincidence because this is a victory for human rights.  
I understand it's a meme, but I'd rather see "Thanks SCOTUS." Even in Obama's speech he gave credit to SCOTUS and all the activists and LGBT supporters over the many years and left himself totally out of it. 
Ugh, can I come live with you?! Compared to the States, New Zealand seems like such an adventure! :D 
Canada's had marriage equality since 2005, what do we win?  But seriously, congrats to both of your countries. 
What I don't get (and I'm an atheist) is why even bother with marriage as homosexuals? Marriage is a religious concept and all major religions are against marriage other than between man and woman, so why do they want to be part of something that denies them by definition? It confuses me. 
Could you source this please? Many redditors like him because they see him as progressive. Personally, I think he's just less crappy than the last pope. 
I'm so worried about that too, and just LGBT+ people in general. It's great to have some time to revel in the big win, but the people getting married legally now can still be fired, evicted, and otherwise persecuted legally, which means we still have a lot of work to do.  But today, we celebrate! 
Sort of. Following the US custom, it's different by state. Most states do it in June, by tradition, but some of us who've been doing it longer established different customs earlier. In Connecticut, for example, it's September.  The reason for that is historical: In the very early days of the gay rights movement, Pride was a political event with a very focused purpose, and for the most impact we had to do it while the state legislature was in session. So we'd take to the streets as soon as they took to their seats, like fucking clockwork, so they'd have no excuse to forget about us or claim they were bogged down with too much other stuff.  We did that for *eighteen* years before we finally got our first bill passed. Ours was also the first state to fly the rainbow flag over the state capitol.  
Mine was actually quite bubbly (Living in a red state).   You might just be following the wrong friends.   
Texas was trying to deal with a federal District case that went against them, and *four* state level cases with *different* outcomes. Meanwhile, the Fifth Circuit had Texas's District case, as well as cases from Louisiana and Mississippi, again with contrary rulings. As soon as the Circuit learned of the appeal of the Sixth Circuit ruling, they decided to wait and see, which was a lot easier than dealing with it all. And everyone else behind them did the same, which is why nothing happened there until yesterday.  
If the complaint about the mosque has to do with parking, that's progress. 
Because they were denied same basic human rights as straight people enjoyed. 
That is their right!   Why would we want to get married in churches that don't support us, anyways?  
Now that it's legal, a reasonable assumption would be that more same-sex couples will get married. With more same-sex couples around the idea of same-sex marriage may become more socially accepted and viewed as normal or closer to normal.  Also, everyone born in the last few years is going to grow up with the assumption that same-sex marriage being legal is normal and good, the same way that almost everyone born after the women's suffrage movement assumes that women voting is normal and good.  You're right that this ruling will not instantly make everyone accept gay marriage but it is a push in the right direction. 
Definitely gonna keep it up now that I have momentum.  Now that I think about it, it's ironic that I've picked up metaphorical momentum now that I've lost physical momentum 
I was the opposite end of the husky scale lol. Short and fat. And I had a decent growth spurt at the beginning of puberty and was taller than others for a few months before everybody else skyrocketed, which helped fill me out to proper size but it didn't last.  I've never talked to anybody about the husky thing but it is awful. Let's take a word with negative connotations and apply it to kids at their most insecure time.  Adults get referred to as "big and tall," I think that would be a better term to use for kids as well. 
That's part of the reason I was able to remain motivated this time, I think. I just turned 20 and I figured if I don't lose it now I never will. 
Will keep it in mind. Once I feel I've lost all the weight I need to, I'll post before-and-afters 
Things have been going pretty ok lately!  Hopefully I keep working hard and pushing myself. 
Thank you! I was thinking /r/keto, then figured maybe a humblebrag might belong better here. Will x-post to loseit tomorrow 
Have been to /r/ketocirclejerk, it's a riot. /r/congratslikeimfive is full of cool people too. 
"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is today."  I also procrastinated for 3 years and I finally happened to latch back onto proper diet and exercise. The hardest part is starting up imo 
Thank you! It was easier than you might think tbh. Although I've noticed that the more fat I lose, the less fat I have left to lose. So the first 30 were way easier than the latest 10. 
Of course :)  Like I said, I'm still chubby. There's clearly room for improvement, and hopefully I can do so before summer 
Thanks! My first priority was looking better. But my health is way more important to me now. 
Congrats to you too! It's a bit of a sore spot for me not having grown much taller since middle school. But then you get to brag about things like this and also in low places you get to watch taller people bump their heads on shit while you glide through :) 
My ultimate goal from the beginning was to look and feel better. Clothes are certainly on the agenda, but I'm gonna wait until I hit my lowest to do more shopping :) 
Thank you from some random hipster in NJ!  Restating what I said somewhere else in here: "The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is today."  To me, it's more admirable to get back into shape at age 40 than at age 20. Keep fighting the good fight :) 
Thanks! Not as much work as you'd think. The trick for me was to just get started, the rest came relatively easy. 
Glad to hear that I might be of some help to you! I'm hoping to make this one of my most successful years after how stagnant all of 2016 was for me. Good luck to you! 
My man! Congrats to you too. Depressed and binge eating is pretty much a summary of me at my max weight lol.  One of the things that keeps me going: is that junk food, or stopping early during a workout, really as enjoyable as looking and feeling good as a result of staying strong? The answer is almost always no. 
Gaining a few pounds back isn't enough to change the fact that you've done great things! congrats to you too! 
I know a lot of people use the thyroid as an excuse to never lose weight. But you're basically doing what I'm doing on hard mode. That's way cooler than what I've done! I'm proud that you've seen at least some results, keep it up :) 
Thanks! I have unlimited meals in the caf, so I can always find at least something decent to eat. 
That's great! Congrats on *your* success. My roommate is trying to gain some as well, and from what I can tell it's harder than losing it. Nothing but respect :) 
Essentially. I probably could have worded it better. But I still have a while to go before I have good health, right now I'm just making healthier decisions trying to get there. 
Congrats dude! Hopefully by the time you're 20 you've caught up to me! If you ever need someone to brag to you can always pm me :) 
Baby steps are better than no steps! Keep it up!  Is your flair a reference to AM btw? 
Thanks and congrats to you too! My first round of weight loss was 4 years ago so I've had to buy new clothes. I went from between a L and XL to a flat M. Hoping to get to S by the time I'm done. I'd recommend keeping one of your largest t-shirts around (if you still have any) to wear when you're feeling down.  In terms of pants, I believe I've gone from a 40" waist to ~32. It's bittersweet when your favorite clothes are falling off all the time :) 
This is such tripe. Total nonsense.  Unless you are a world-class bodybuilder, BMI is simply a ratio of weight to height, and the overwhelming majority of people will be at their healthiest within the (very wide and generous) range of a healthy bmi  
Won't resent the scale if they just keep up the good work though. Gaining the weight back will only happen if one goes back to how they got fat in the first place. 
I just screencapped this an sent it to my sister who is in her second year to become an RN! Thanks, should encourage her a bit!  
What's stopping you, if you don't mind me asking? 27 is nothing. I was at college with people in their 40's, and back in uni days one of the mature students was in his 60's easily.  It's never too late to go back :) 
I got my nursing degree at the age of 30. Great career! Both of you will do great! 
Damn, right! Thanks for wanting to serve, good luck to you too!  
It's demanding, long hours, and nurses practically run the hospitals as the physicians never seem to be around. 
It depends on where you live. The average annual salary for RNs in the US is $71,000. 
Sounds much like the information I was given today.  Mine is in southern Ontario - perhaps it's the same school... do you know Steve? ;) (all but that last part is legit) 
Thanks - this might just aid me in my next quest, finding the right fella post-divorce ;) 
Same here. Even if they are disagreeing with me so long as they aren't flat out insulting. 
Im only on reddit for a month or two and does that haha I've always been old school though! 
It's a weird habit, but I use it as a way to keep track of what I saw and read on reddit. I rarely ever downvote anyway. 
Yes I agree. It should at least be connected to the post or comment. 
I agree. As long as it's not an insult, bad trolling or something completely unrelated. 
Oh, my friend is just like this. Now matter if Facebook, Instagram or whatever. And when it comes to answering messages.....  However, I criticized him a few times, and now he's already getting way better. 
Hell yeah, I am the Reddit Karma Social Welfare departement! 
Oh, I just found it and tried to upvote it ;)) But it seems to be archived. 
Lol, at least try to make it connected to the subject of the post and you'll get upvotes :P  But don't forget to upvote my posts too! 
It's so great, I hope you have an equally great weekend! 
Yes, I had posts like these too. However, I tried too. 
Same! Especially when I don't really have anything to say in reply, I think I got into the habit on facebook and twitter and now I just do it here too.  
I would upvote "this"  But not the other two. As long as it's somehow connected to the post or is no insult. 
Yes! Something I was thinking of too, but forgot to mention! 
Sorry for you :(  Something like this drives me mad. 
I see this all the time in posts with words like terrorist, racist, etc.  Is there something about words ending in "t" that trips people up?   
Interacting is obviously the most important. Way more than simple upvote. 
I agree. It really has to be something I really really dislike with all my heart. 
Gold in my language means "downvote". You still want Gold? 
I know what you mean! I always upvote the parent comment or a question too, because without it a conversation would not even have started.. 
It depends a lot. If the opinion is expressed in an acceptable manner, I might upvote it. If it's something I don't agree with, I just ignore it. And if it's a comment I REALLY despise the last solution would be downvote. 
Bad askredditor, no lurking. Mandated chatting for all.  
I'm glad you came! We're going to have so much fun together!  
Is anyone even capable of being mean when everyone's so nice?   What's the worst this sub has seen? 
No, thank you for visiting! This subreddit is awesome! 
Bacon pancakes? Wait, that's a thing? Why have I not heard of this delicious food before?    
Since this thread made it to /r/all too, I don't think there'll be a shortage of people to talk to! 
We already had automod set up before thanks to some default mod friends. Oh I've def had experience of a growth like this. I predicted this sub will be p much askreddit unless we do some heavy modding. We're working on some new guidelines and rules coming uo very soon. 
Very top right hand corner. It's in the "casual conversation" banner. 
I'm sure your day will be full neat surprises, just like you are to me being in this sub! I hope you stay! 
I really hope you stick around, Wazer! We could really use more awesome people like you!  
foggy right now. it was cloudy yesterday and will be overcast tomorrow.  
just post whatever you want! As long as it's not racist,sexist,etc. 
Same here, I didn't even bother reading the other answers in the thread ! It seems all warm and peaceful here :D 
Aw thanks :)  Congrats on getting active! Yeah loads of people slack a bit at Christmas (me included), but you're right, it will be much easier to restart this time round. Good luck! 
Lovely to hear! I am making a new 2016 thread later on so feel free to post your resolutions there. 
Thank you so much for the kind words and the gold!  Happy New Year friend :) 
I am making a new 2016 thread later today, feel free to post them there! 
Thanks! I didn't use a bot (wouldn't know how to!) but I copied and pasted the below text and just filled in each username, link URL and goal.  -----  /u/  Exactly one year ago in the New Year Megathread, I asked you what's one thing you wanted to achieve by 31st Dec 2015. I said I would message you on the 31st to see if you completed it. Well, today's the day!  [Your goal was:]()  ** 
Why stop masterbating? Is there a specific reason? 
Good job on staying out of hospital, I hope the fireworks aren't bad!  I am making a new 2016 thread later today, feel free to post your new resolutions there! 
At least you tried!  Sounds like a great goal to me though, best of luck! 
It's definitely a great way to encourage upvoting. Noice! 
Ohhh that's what those were for! Hahaaha I'm going to up vote everything looking for this is sparta! 
I hope your cat comes back :( waiting and hoping for him to walk back through your door must be terrible. Good feels your way :) 
See, now I feel a bit bad.  My dog was found on the street and no one came to claim her at the pound after several weeks, so we got first pick for adopting her.  What if her family still misses her and wants her back?  Then again she was found without a collar and is a breed of dog that tends to be abandoned according to Wikipedia. 
He's been very hesitant around the other cats and there has been some hissing so I don't believe they do which is sad. I think he does? He certainly recognised my Dad, none of the cats really like my Dad as he's loud and Benjie wouldn't go near him, and to me that says he recognises us?   I can't get enough cuddles he must be sick of me!  
Yes he's microchipped! I'm amazed it even worked! It's so weird having him back home.   I think it shows that getting your pet chipped could end in a happy reuniting 
Had to go away for a bit. She was a changed cat after her near death experience, had to leave and be alone to sort through all her thoughts and ruminate on what it means to be alive. 
My dog would get out constantly by digging his way out, we ended up filling up the part under my neighbors fence with concrete, he hasn't gotten out since unless someone gives him a way. 
Yes he's microchipped, it's so worth getting done.   We asked around and the carpet fitter had rang the neighbour whose house he was working at as a cat had bolted out the back of his van but we only found this out by asking around.   My Mum thought that they had either found Benjie dead or he was alive as its not the vets we normally go to. But it turns out he's alive! She was given the details of the lady who had been feeding him and we went up to go see her and thank her. She was a little upset to see him go as he's a lovely cat but we're going to send her some flowers and a photo of him  
A long time ago my cat had a litter of kittens, and my aunt adopted one of them. She named him Hemingway.  Hemingway was an asshole.  He took advantage of their kind, elderly neighbor once he found out she put out food for the neighborhood strays. He would enter her house uninvited and beg to be fed. If she didn't move fast enough (which she rarely did after her hip surgery) he would bite her ankles to try to kick her into gear. My aunt did her best to correct, or at least mitigate, his dickish behavior, but he was resilient. I don't know why the neighbor put up with him, but she apparently didn't mind, and he ended up spending more time there than at my aunt's house. 
Honestly no time like the present, strike while the iron's hot ya dig.  Just don't be one of those freaks that lashes out like a complete asshole if you're rejected cuz that's not cool at all. 
I have almost exclusively been calling it "the fart air" so don't sweat it 
Holy shit that's gotta be one of the nicest things I've ever read.  You rule. 
I've heard Day9 use it from time to time. Maybe that's where OP got it from. 
Dude no kidding, I was wondering if I was just some goofy outlier or if it's always gonna feel like high school for those few minutes where you're wanting to tell a girl how you feel.  I'm pretty sure it would have been 100x smoother if I had just done it in person tho, so I'm just going with that from now on.  I didn't even consider texting her again when she didn't respond cuz it was like "well, she's either at work or got freaked the fuck out enough to never speak to me again" lmao.  And MAN thanks for that middle sentence you have no idea how much that means to me.  I've had some seriously pervasive issues with self-loathing that has paralyzed me from approaching women so, so many times.  Being able to climb over that wall is legitimately a huge deal for me. 
Oh yeah totally.  We talked a little bit about the whole "don't want it to get weird if it doesn't work out" scenario so I wanna make it as easygoing as possible.  I'm a simple dingus so all I know is how to be myself anyway, and like you said if that was good enough then hopefully I'm all set. 
Right on man that's hilarious lmao.  I've just been a goddamn beacon of positive vibes all day.  Glowing like a motherfucker due in no small part to how awesome the people in this sub are 
Oh no I totally agree.  I learned a long time ago not to do that.  I'm definitely nervous but not... freaking out I guess.  Let's say cautiously optimistic??  We've hung out 1 on 1 enough that I'm already sure that it's gonna be awesome.  Just a matter of not doing something catastrophically dumb I guess, whatever the hell that could even be. 
Also in college. I honestly try not to really remember that the person I was in high school was actually me. Literally every moment of my life then pisses me off now and its just tough to think back to that. 
Hahaha, you sound a lot like me.   I don't know if I'd say crazy.. to me crazy is when your mental state overwhelms your morals and intentions in a negative way. To me I'd say you're just a perfectionist and someone who's decided to make a change. It may be a difficult and intense approach, and therapy wouldn't hurt.. but as long as your intentions are good I wouldn't call it crazy :) 
There's a podcast called 'That Was Us' where the guests reflect on old emails or letters they sent. It's really funny and all about the cringe! Makes me feel like the past is more endearing as opposed to embarrassing 
A friend of mine once said that he's never experienced a two year stretch in his life where he didn't look back on his two-years-previous-self and think *damn, I can't believe I was such an idiot.*  I found this admission of his very freeing. 
Yes exactly!! Well said. For me its become kind of paralyzing.  
oh well that's good! not necessarily what i was talking about but I'm glad you're feeling positive about the steps and choices you've made!  
lol just about, but I waited until we were off of Skype.  
I think I'm being very clear, what I'm asking. Would an average-sized rowboat support her without capsizing? 
Tess, my favorite fashion woman! I'm currently in England and it's great and all but I CAN'T EXPRESS MYSELF (fashion wise) BECAUSE I NEED TO WEAR A THICK WINTER JACKET. 
Good poem! But it could be heavily improved by saying "so fluently" rather than "such fluently." Such just sounds weird.  I really like the last paragraph (stanza?) though, it's got some damn good flow to it. Great job! 
I'm hoping we have a non-traditional wedding too. I dreamt about it once. It was fantasy-ish, but not in that over-the-top cheesy way.  
We met on World of Warcraft. We've been together in person a few times. I'll be visiting her again soon.  
We've been together in person a few times. She looks just as amazing in person as she does on Skype.  
It was a lot of things. She's just so accepting of me, flaws and all. I feel so comfortable being myself and being open with her because I know she isn't judging me. We have a lot in common, but we also have a ton of differences and that makes things interesting. She makes me want to be a better person and thinking of her just makes me push myself to do well. I just can't put into words how I feel about her.  
Thank you for the downvotes. I have faith that all of the downvoters were actually telling me not to go ahead with this marriage. Your downvotes worked and I am glad to say I called it off.  I bought the ring locally for much less and gave it to my meemaw instead :) Merry Xmas everyone! 
Aw that's sweet. It's those little things that put a smile on your face. 
That sounds amazing, and then the end made me feel incredibly sad. But it sounds like you had a great relationship and that's all one could ever ask for. 
Aw that's cool. I can picture this as a final scene to the series finale of some family sitcom or something. 
Wow 6 years? What kept you two away from each other for so long? 
Oh definitely. His birthday is this week as well as father's day so it's perfect timing to give him something special.  
I made little paper golf clubs in school. I found out he still has them on his desk. :) 
In addition to this: having anything at all hanging from the rearview mirror can constitute obstruction of vision and get you pulled over or a ticket.  
I have a recurring dream that it's halfway through the semester and I realize I'm enrolled in another class that I have yet to attend or do any work for. 28, been out of college for over 5 years. 
I like that phrase, "a good emptiness." It's like those days where you're schedule is completely free, so you can sit on your ass and do nothing.  
Good luck man! I'm sure when the time comes, you'll get back into it in no time.  
Haha judging by everyone's reply, that sounds about right.  
I had a similar experience last semester when I completely forgot the actual day of the final. The syllabus had a different day in it and I forgot that the professor sent an announcement out a few weeks back notifying us of the change. I freaked out that entire day almost in tears because that was one of my core classes. Thank God I sent her an email explaining what happened and she was able to set up a final for me at a later date before she left back home. That was the scariest experience of college for me. 
It was great. It was kinda surreal the entire time, like looking back it never actually happened but it did. I was real happy to see a lot of my classmates so we could bitch about our finals week one last time but I was pretty bummed that it would probably be the last time I see them. But it was great experience. How was yours? 
Oh yeah man. College is way better than high school even when some assignments where kicking my ass. Just the fact that you're treated like an adult makes it way more enjoyable than H.S.  
Miss it? No. Does it feel weird? Yes, yes it does. But to me so far, it feels weird in a pleasurable way. I still work my part time job but the fact that I have no other obligations after that does feel like being freed from a cage but also being pushed into an empty void almost. But you can fill that void with whatever you want and that's what makes it pleasant.  
For a moment time just slowed down to a crawl. You got me on that one. 
Or the one where you go to class but you are naked? 
Wow, a lot of people here seem to have the same type of dream so you're not alone on that one.  
Yup, it's always like 'what do you mean there's no project to do? what am i supposed to do then?!' 
Ill think ill err on pc reddit.   Seriously considering trolling on 4chan tho 
It really is a good marketing channel though. Especially to highly educated demographics. Not for consumer products tho 
Eh. I view it as a way to get more free stuff. If advertising/marketing wasn't so prevalent we wouldn't have so many Youtube channels and such. 
Mods don't care, neither does most of reddit. Let's be honest, we keep upvoting things that could or could not be advertising, as long as we find them mildly funny or interesting. I'm personally fine with that. 
According to the rules of Reddit, 1/9 of your posts can be self-promotional. 
What damage could they possibly do, that hasn't been done already? Reddit has been steadily declining *a while*. 
Err .. you really want to try visual analytics and data mining consulting?? 
I work in social media and this is so true. I hate using most social media outside of the office because I spend eight to 10 hours away staring at stupid tweets.  
So now - instead of posting your real thoughts and ideas while free to do so without recrimination (except for you know....reddit itself); now you are in the corporate definition of a "hot seat".  You poor shlub ! :) 
I get social security so I guess that means the government pays me while I reddit lol (I crack myself up) :) 
I usually make dinner, exercise, go to the sauna, eat dinner have sexy times and sleep 
I recommend you go to college just for that piece kf paper. HR people are dense with no understanding of nuance.   That said go to lynda.com and start the class online maeketing fundamentals.   Tell me if your interested. Ill send you a 20 day trial.    
Its just a habit leftover from my first language i would say  (Korean swahili) 
Lol they think its for a bunch of old guys because the website is so "90's" 
Thats really cool. Care to share the twotter and facebook method so i can ask my bi guys about it?  
Thank you, it was a good learning experience I guess  
That's a brutal story haha, I'm sure the alcohol would have amplified the burp. Thanks for sharing it :) 
HAHA Tom & Jerry's ice-cream feels like something I'd definitely say by mistake. Thanks for sharing that, it made me laugh :) 
It's probably because most guys saw her and just thought "she's out of my league." 
That's so cute haha, I guess it really isn't thaaat similar considering she didn't reject her future husband hahaha. 
Thank you, I appreciate it. I honestly had no expectations going into it because I knew whether I got rejected or not, I'd at least walk away with more experience and that I tried. Your words mean a lot to me, thank you! 
You just gotta try man, even if you might face rejection like me. I've dealt with many regrets before and 90% of the time it's because I didn't do something rather than doing something I regret. Hope it works out for you! 
Haha well I executed it pretty poorly! I'm not sure about being more confident but I'm happy I just tried.  
Hey, thank you. Yeah I understand her rejection was nothing personal, it would have been nice if it had worked out but at the same time I didn't really have any expectations. I usually tend to internalise a lot of rejection and failure, so I'm glad that you reminded me it's not an indicator of my worth. 
Congratulations! From my experience, people seem to be more open to making friends in college, especially in your freshman year. What you're feeling now with the regret of not knowing and the wondering in what could have happened - that's the feeling I wanted to avoid, so I went for it and talked to her. I know that feeling of regret all too well and it sucks, I hope you can come to terms with it. I wish you all the best in college! You never know that you had the "gonads" to do it until you try, trust me. Good luck out there.  
Yep! You have the courage, you just don't know it yet until you actually try. It's probably better if you try asking someone out when you're not too emotionally invested though, in case you face rejection, it won't feel so brutal. All the best! 
Thank you. You're 100% right and I agree. I definitely understand what you mean by crushing on someone for too long and making a move when you're already very much emotionally invested, it can be devastating when it goes wrong. 
Yeah, I'm doing my best to get better at this and not fear rejection so much. Thanks for your wise words. 
Creepy is synonymous to your username haha, but I definitely agree with you. 
Damn, I'm sorry to hear that. I really wished things could have gone differently for you. If anything your post inspires me to keep trying, I hope you keep trying yourself too, nothing worse than that feeling of regret from not doing something. Wishing you all the best out there. 
Thank you haha, that sentence sounds like a cute thing to say, maybe I'll use it one day! 
Oh good for you! Happy it worked for you. Good luck on your date! 
Yeah I agree, I wasn't actually expecting her to say yes or anything, I just wanted to try, but next time I might have to go more casual like you mentioned hahaha. I'm still pretty young (20), so I'm sure you're right! 
Of course, she seemed like a friendly person for sure in the small amount of time I spoke with her. Unfortunately we're at university, so I doubt I will ever see her again. 
Thanks, I appreciate it. I know that feeling of regret and it really sucks, but I'm certain that you will come across other people in your life that you will make you happy. I know if the opportunity ever comes up again, you have the ability to take it. I know life sucks, but I know you can do it, you won't know until you try. I wish you all the best. 
Haha thank you! I'll keep trying, don't you worry! 
Thanks. In an ideal world, I would have loved to have spent a little more time with her in class but it was the last class for the unit, so I only had that one chance to talk to her/ask her out. 
Good on you!!! Glad you did it. Do you still see her every now and then since she lives nearby? Does it still hurt or have you moved on to greener pastures? 
Hey, thank you, I appreciate it. Getting rejected today was definitely not as bad as I would have imagined it, so you're right. 
Yeah for sure! There are other cute fish in the sea. 
Hey thanks man! It definitely DID go badly haha but I didn't feel as bad as I thought I would have. I'm sure I'll laugh about it in the near-future. 
Thank you, but we'll probably never see each other again, and to be honest based on her reaction, I don't think she'd even want to be friends hahaha. 
That really sucks. At least you got to know relatively early on about how she felt. I understand how you feel about being rejected rather than being led on, I feel that way sometimes about my past relationships but I think it's normal for us to feel that way, relationships will never work out if we're not willing to be vulnerable. You took a chance to put yourself out there and even if it didn't work out, you had the courage to take that risk.   You make a valid point, I agree with you on managing expectations.  Have you moved on since or do you still hold on to some thoughts/feelings about this person? 2 years is a long time.  Hope you're doing alright. 
To be fair, I think the way I asked was really awkward and made her uncomfortable, but I'm not so bothered by it I guess. Thank you! 
Thank you! It makes me happy knowing I made you smile. I've said this a few times in the thread already but I'll say it again because it's so true. I don't think you'll ever feel like you have the balls to ask someone out until you're actually doing it. Just have to make sure when you're going to ask someone out, you can handle the possible rejection. Thanks for your comment, I really hope everything goes well in your future, keep smiling friend :) 
Oh boy, did she raise any red flags during your relationship? What were they if so? I feel like this is good information to know for my future endeavours haha. 
Thank you! Yes, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be 
Oh no, that's terrible, sorry to hear that. Goes to show taking courage can really pay off. Don't be afraid to face rejection, take it easy, and I know for sure you can do it. All the best man :) 
Haha your comment made me laugh. My palms were definitely sweaty. 
Yeah I will, learning to handle rejection is an art, I swear haha 
Just cause there's a goal keeper doesn't mean you can't score! Just kidding, good nice effort, at least you were willing to try :) 
Thanks, I understand rejecting other people can be tough, but the way she rejected me was so brutal it was comical haha. Some people are good at rejecting people and some people are bad at it I guess. 
Haha thank you. Yes, I'm almost certain it's going to be a great story to tell to friends or future partners one day for a good laugh.  
That's not a great way for her to communicate, assuming she's genuinely avoiding you. I'm sorry that happened to you, nothing worse than having someone leaving you hanging. Hang in there buddy, I hope it gets better. 
Ahh that's the worst, don't worry I've been there too, except I didn't run haha but I definitely got rejected. 
Thank you! I know, it is slightly odd for me too but I just wanted to at least try because I didn't feel like I'd have any other opportunities.  
Thanks man. Yeah, when I put myself in her shoes I can understand how she'd feel about a stranger asking her out over a pen haha, but I'm not too bothered about it. That's interesting, what happened that made you learn that you shouldn't fold your cards too soon? I have a another situation that might benefit from your response. 
I've heard this happen about three times in this thread already :(. I remember it happening once to me before and it crushed me. I'm sorry that happened to you, hope you were able to recover and every thing is going well for you now. 
Thanks! And you're 100% the outcome is the same if I never asked her if I got rejected, but the possibility of her reciprocating is out there if I just try. 
I've seen the bad/ugly for sure but the good definitely outweighs the bad for sure! 
Haha to be honest, her horrified reaction wouldn't lead me to believe so, but luckily I'm not too bothered by it haha. 
Hahaha oh no, what if she was genuinely tired though? I know 2 hour bus trips can be tiring haha 
Hey, thank you :) I felt not as bad as I think I would have! So it's definitely good to try! Good luck out there. 
I entered the room of my college composition class and sat down at a far desk in circle (the desks were in a circle because that is the only legal way to arrange chairs in any class offered by the English department).  Anyway -- I sat down and began to read while the rest of the class trickled in. In my periphery, I noticed a lovely blonde sit down a few seats over. I waited for a moment that wouldn't seem obvious, and then I made my move. I picked up my stuff, scooted over, and turned to say hello. "Hi, Pope."  Not only did she beat me to the introduction and already know me. She was my ex-girlfriend, very recent ex. I applauded myself for at least having consistent taste. We sat by each other for the semester. Pleasant but odd. 
Actually, I'm curious, are there any criteria for the letter flair? 
Well she did say in another thread that she enjoys positive and happy subs. And that's exactly what this sub is. 
Thanks. I'm going to hang out in some friendly subreddits. 
They have to accept your moderation request first. 
It's a lab class. I'm attempting to build a home lab but the fact that I'm renting a house on a military base dampens hopes :( I am a chemistry major though! 
I think it's good she stepped down, of course all the hate is horrible but I think it's better this way. Ellen was never supposed to be the full time CEO, she was a stand in while they found someone else, but now we have the original founder back as CEO, and I think that's a good thing. 
For a lab class - I'm going to do some analysis with it. 
I don't usually get the chance to upvote Newsradio.  Excellent show. 
You just confused a *lot* of people...  ...white butts. 
In the end everyone dies... and they all end up in the bright white butts in the sky 
Yes.   Also, protip, people with the extension cannot tell the difference between, butt-to-butt, cloud-to-butt, butt-to-cloud, or even cloud-to-cloud.  It's *all* butts to us.  This enables clever trolling. 
Just type it with an open parenthesis: (loud.   See, now you've transferred your frustration to the programmers who are still looking for then end of the expression....                                     
This is gold! "Honolulu gets windy with their butts". 
Do you get request from the non techies to put everyeverything on the cloud? 
It could easily be done. Cloud-to-butt is open source and very easy to configure. 
It's the safest place to hide things because no one will think to look there. That's why drugs are measured in buttloads.  
You could turn for sale into not for sale, just to make her wonder why everyone is posting things they won't sell. 
Close - it changes instances of the phrase "the cloud" to "my butt".  It's juvenile and *hilarious*. 
Aw that's sweet. It's those little things that put a smile on your face. 
That sounds amazing, and then the end made me feel incredibly sad. But it sounds like you had a great relationship and that's all one could ever ask for. 
Aw that's cool. I can picture this as a final scene to the series finale of some family sitcom or something. 
Wow 6 years? What kept you two away from each other for so long?

In addition to this: having anything at all hanging from the rearview mirror can constitute obstruction of vision and get you pulled over or a ticket.  
How embarrassing it is depends on what you said when you started talking to the stranger. Hopefully nothing too personal! I can see how anything would be a bit uncomfortable though. They've probably already forgotten about it though. I always remind myself of that when I feel embarrassed.  
Would have been funny if the second car was also not your ride 
This made my day. Thank you for sharing. Your dad rocks. 
Yeah, if it was a guy my husband would have jumped to action, but it was a girl like you described so he just watched as confused as I was. You would think as a woman you'd be more careful about whose car you just jump into! 
In Australia it shows you the number plate, pretty much the only thing I look for because I'm bad at cars 
Probably going to take place in Alabama, Louisiana, or Texas. Just saying. 
I had something similar happen to me but my story is not as upstanding as yours. I freaked out at a rave while I was tripping on LSD and had to get outside. So there I was, Downtown Atlanta, on my own sprawled out on the ground. I was looking way too comfortable laying on the ground pretty sweaty from the raging. Anyways a homeless guy came up to me and gave me a dollar and said, "looks like you need this more than I do." At first i didn't know what was going on because I was tripping balls, but then it hit me that this homeless dude did what he could do to help. I was offended a little bit after he left, him thinking I was homeless and all and then I realized that was probably the kindest thing I have ever seen 
If I'm traveling alone, I sit in the front, if I'm traveling with someone, I sit in the back with them.  90% of the time I have great conversations with my Uber drivers when traveling alone. 
I walked in on a married couple banging on their couch years ago when I worked pizza delivery.      They had a house that looked like an apartment building in a neighborhood full of apartment buildings with only a screen door closed at the front, leading into what looked like a long hallway between apartments.      As much as I would like to say it ended like a porn all that really happened was a couple panicked moments of apologies, frantic scrambling to cover, and a very embarrassed tip. 
I can't stop laughing either at the mental image I have of you just slowly turning to see her in the other car. 
My husband was approached at Target once - he had on a red, collared shirt and khakis. A lady started asking him where the deodorant was located.  He's not usually quick on his feet but he immediately said - my best guess would be armpits LOL  They both had quite a laugh once she realized he was not an employee! :) 
That was a really nice thing for him to do! Beyond the call of duty! :) 
They have to have a sticker? Well there should be no issues then! 
Yeah then they take their sweet ass time to run up the fare. Cab drivers are a lot more shady than uber or lyft drivers. There's a reason cabs are going to be obsolete soon  
Thanks, I enjoy music and writing, but don't see myself making a career out of either. I've written a few children's books that I might try to get published at some point and I started playing piano last year, but have been a little too depressed and focused on getting a job to play recently. I really enjoy running and working out, but I've had to get rid of my gym membership because I don't have any money. Overall i'd say I'm very lucky all things considered, but it's hard to consistently tell myself I should just stay positive and move forward. 
I really appreciate your anecdote, it does help put things in perspective. I kow that realistically I need to accept my situation, stay positive, and move forward, but it's been tough to keep that mindset. 
I don't know why, but this made me laugh. Thank you. 
Thanks, it's absolutely true and I appreciate being reminded of that. 
You do a great job at presenting the problem, but any advice for those going through this? 
I would apply to those "3 years experience" jobs anyway. It's a relatively low bar and it's basically an excuse for them to say "we're not going to train you to do everything."   If you can learn things quickly you'll be fine. Your master's should count for one year, and you can point to many of the projects you've worked on in class as a separate experience. It's double dipping, but only a little.   The biggest problem with starting a career is that nobody wants to hire someone starting out. On paper, it's much safer to go with someone else.  
Sure, i'd run, play the piano, go on vacation, work out. 
Don't join it out of convenience, op . Do it only if you like it. The knowledge gained may not be transferrable to your net job  
Sorry I interpreted that as:  "hey, you know how it's our second date?" "yes" "I'm going to marry your sister." "... You bastard" 
My ex told me she wanted me to marry me someday like 2 months into dating me and then we broke up 2 more months later. Yeah OP slow tf down you're still way too early in the honeymoon phase to legitimately be looking at rings. 
My husband and I did something similar too! Knew we wanted to get married, became something we were talking about all the time with excitement, then decided to "just peek" at rings.   That day he came home with a beautiful blue topaz ring and proposed officially!! 
I noticed this too.  Classic case of only hearing what you want to hear. Two months is nothing. It's a blip of time while wearing rose colored glasses.  I don't see the point of getting married so soon after so little time.  If it's meant to be she will still be there in a year+ after you've gained financial stability and knowledge. 
I was 36 when I met my now-husband.   For years, I said it was insulting and that I would seriously reconsider a relationship with a man who made such a poor choice.   My husband orchestrated this amazing, fairytale proposal.   I mean, a fucking trained dolphin was involved. Seriously.   That night, when I called my parents to tell them, they were appropriately excited for us but they didn't seem surprised.   When I said as much, my mom was like "you have no idea how hard it was to not tell you. I've known for weeks!"  Turns out, hubs asked everyone in my family, including my nieces and nephews, before he asked me.   I really did re-evaluate things. But I arrived at the conclusion that his motives were very good, and that he intended no disrespect by it.   I'm glad I did. We are very happy.  
That's awesome! I don't really believe that you have to wait X amount of years or anything before you ask/talk about it. And thanks :)  
Thanks! Just how well we clicked off the bat, how we literally agree on everything that's important in a relationship, how much I like being with her, and just how much she shows how much I'm appreciated. It's something no girl has really been like before her.  
That's amazing good for you! Any advice for me at this stage from someone with experience?  
That's so sweet it brought a tear to my eye and I'm sending her this comment. Thank you and I hope I am!  
My parents got married at ages 20 and 18, after knowing each other for 4 months.   44 years later, they are still together. They have hated each other for most of my life.   You truly never know...  Which is why making the decision to get married so prematurely is a terrible idea.  
Oh no this isn't happening now at all. We both decided to wait a few months at least I'm not sure why everyone thinks we are going out getting engaged this second. Guess I didn't word it right.  
I like this idea a lot I already go to therapy and he has been helping a lot with this and offered to have her come in for a session with me soon  
Downvotes for a Wayne's World reference? Come on, Reddit. 
Exactly I don't want to wait and let this opportunity pass up. I know people say have fun in your 20s blah blah but I already have a full time job and we are both almost done with school and I've never had more fun than the fun I have when we are together. I don't see a reason to wait.  
I don't have a sex playlist. In fact I don't listen to music during sex. Well.. there was that one time when we blasted Vampire Weekend... Wasn't my idea though!  
I get the same feeling too, with 2 songs in particular. I'm not very open with my emotions, so it's beneficial knowing I can still feel all that shit after the fact too. 
That's exactly what I do too- it's also interesting because looking back you can tel which few months I was more stressed about school than others (the music is sadder/slower) 
My sort-of-ex (we had a super short relationship) keeps trying to introduced introduce me but though I like some of the songs (Blood, Sweat, tears, Chained up, B-DAY) I can't imagine watching the dances over and over again like she does. 
Chrono Trigger ftw.  Anyway, I always thought that situation happened only in movies ("I love you, you're amazing, we're perfect for each other, but we have to break up because reasons.") People really find the love of their life and break up because of logistics? How "amazing" could it have been? Not attacking you I just always assumed people were remembering those relationships with unrealistic fondness. Anyway hope you're doing well! 
Yea I use it to bond with people too. I remember many nights just laying in bed at a girls house just getting them to show me their favourite songs n shit. I think you can tell a lot about a person by what music they listen to. One girl was all classic and alternative rock, another was pop, my girl now is all rap and sexy r&b, it's real interesting. I just wish Spotify didn't cap at 3,333 songs on a device so I wouldn't have to delete anything for my new shit. 
Oh lord you poor soul. I was into p!atd  for a solid three minutes, though I have to say my 21 pilots phase took about 6 months to kick. 
It happens to the best of us, stay strong brother. 
As a chronically depressed person, I listen to sad music because it helps me feel not alone with my feelings when no one I know is as depressed as I am.  
Yo I got stretches of classic rock, indie, metal, classical, edm, house, and remixes through out my whole shit, and my typical genres are rap and soul. My minds been opened to basically all genres if it sound good to me now. 
Thank you! The age gap has rubbed some people the wrong way, but a lot of our friends and family support us. She makes me truly happy and has made me see meaning in life as I really wanted to end my life shortly after my wife died, she has made me want to keep going and I love her so much!  
Thanks, she makes me happy and has helped me through my depression and I can't wait to marry her this weekend!  
Well, Reddit kept me busy for over 12 hours a day for the last 3 years. I would not be here to reply to you if Reddit hadn't kept me company honestly...   I just signed a 1 year lease with my new gf. Hang in there, someone is looking for you right now!  
The biggest difference I saw play out in real life was 25 years.  He passed when he was 87.  They had 2 kids. They were married over 20 years and were very happy.  
Thanks, I do think some days that I'm just an old man, but my fiancee makes me feel so young! I love her so much!  
You love them differently, and never the same. One person feels more like home than the other, the other feels more like a fun work partner, a good roommate or a friend. You love the way one's hair shines reddish when the light hits it, the way the other one does their hair up. You love one's imagination, friendliness, storytelling abilities and creativity, the other's business sense, shrewdness, homey tendencies and the way they talk to the cashier. You still find yourself missing things; he used to leave a bit of something delicious (or truly awful) he made for me with a note, this one doesn't. The last one sung to himself, this one doesn't. It might be love, but it's a reminder. It's never the same flavor of love even if it's the same brand. It's spaghetti, but it's not your mom's. 
My gf is older, makes less money and is average looking.   But we laugh like idiots when we are together, it's fantastic! Wasted 22 years with someone that was pretty to look at...  
As someone who's finished two relationships from 10-14 years older, I hope I get this peace of mind. There are spells where I feel stable enough to let their opinions bounce off, but there are other times I'm terrified of loving someone that much older than me and I start feeling like I'm not equal, even though every experience has told me I am.  
That's so exciting! The wait must be a drag but they do say it's who you know and not what you know. My fingers are crossed! 
You will be in my position, if you want to get there then the only thing holding you back is yourself. It took me five years to get back into education, I kept putting it off each year until I finally realised I needed to otherwise I will never progress.  If you truly want to then go for it! 
Sorry, the American education system is different to mine, could I get an eli5 on the "big ol' super 8"? And the 4.6?  I assume 9.7 is out of 10 and that's fantastic!  
I've heard the first year referred to as a throw away year, it's a chance for people to learn the standard requirements and gives valuable insight into their capabilities. You can only ever improve from those foundations. Being an A student now is fantastic and I hope you go as far as you can. 
That's only a few days away!   Year one has been fun but I'm excited to be getting one step closer to graduating. 
Ah that feeling is awful, I'm sure you have done well and that there is nothing to fear. Have a relaxing night and try to stay positive. 
Still an accomplishment to be proud of, enjoy that feeling. 
Absolutely, my problem now though is that I have nothing to do until September, yeah I have a part time job and volunteer but nothing to challenge me. I'm really looking forward to going back. 
Graduation must've been so exciting, what's next for you? 
A local one within a small town that has only been established as a university centre for a few years.   I'm positive you have passed the year though, when do you hear back about the last module? 
try to attend every lecture/pay attention/study, try new things and as always have fun! 
Job happiness is essential, you need to do what makes you happy. I hope all comes your way. 
Thank you, the next few weeks will fly by and then that awful waiting period sets in while everything is being marked.  Hope you have done well. 
I know! It's strange, love it though. It's always so nice when a community bands together.  This is no longer my achievement, it's ours. 
It is a great feeling and yeah I focus on what's ahead but I have time to celebrate this achievement  Feedback is always necessary, it's part of the process to learn from mistakes and improve.  I agree, being at university has opened many doors with many people I would not have met otherwise and the support is amazing. 
How long is the exam?  Make sure to stay hydrated and best of luck. 
It'll only ever improve from here. You have the basics behind you now to bounce from. 
How do you feel they both went? I'm awful being put on the spot, would rather do essays. 
That's what I like to hear!  Are you finished completely or due to go back in September? 
August is such a long way away, fingers crossed on your results.  Sounds like you've had an interesting two years.  In year two I'll be looking at legislation in practice, capacity, professional competence and three more modules I cannot remember off the top of my head. 
You can tell me and Reddit, I'm always happy to hear about peoples accomplishments  
To be fair an apprenticeship is brilliant, depending on the pay. Learning on the job and earning is the best way. 
It can be difficult getting to know someone. Sometimes taking a chance is worth it though.  
Quite likely the case. She's a bit weird, but I love that. 
This was exactly my experience.  I always thought the ideal of romance and affection and emotions and just being able to connect on every level with a man was a pipe dream. I had never been in love, and never expected I would be.  Finding someone who could handle my weirdness and pitch in some of his own, someone who was open to expressing how he feels about me and does it often, someone who's compassionate and kind and gentle... all of it seemed like something from a book, something that would never happen, especially not to ugly, dumb, annoying, crazy me.  Then it did, and my life was changed, and I can't imagine life without him.  Congrats to OP, and congrats to you as well! :) 
Just jump in with both feet. Don't overthink it. If it was meant to be you'll know. :) 
Yup, like she encourages me and makes me want to be a better person. I hope she feels that I do the same for her. 
Yeah, it seems you're right. I was a bit of an idiot for thinking I did understand and that everyone else was the idiot for believing in love. 
Love is a great drug. And as with any great drug, love will ruin your life.  
i bought  a bonsai last year and took good care of it, none of my friends complimented me on that. then it died and now it lies in my living room as a skeleton with dead leaves fallen around it and everyone is llike - wow nice concept man. wtf  
I think that's how most everyone feels. Most of us are just winging it and pretend we know what we're doing. It still blows my mind when I sometimes think about how I have my own car now and I can go wherever I want, or how others at work trust me with important shit.  
LOL so basically while we were all throwing shells and dodging banana peels, you were already getting a head start on life. 
Just be yourself always, and don't let anyone tell you you're too young/too old to do something that you really enjoy (as long as it's within the law haha) 
I wish I had white hair... I'd look just like one of those character's in my japanese animes! (ie. Kaworu) 
Yes exactly! With my Nan being sick and dying this year, I've learned not to worry about small stuff anymore. It isn't worth it  
I'll work on getting a picture posted! It's not completely white yet, not even close, but I have more white in it than before  
I love seeing natural greys and whites in people's hair, personally; there's something vaguely dignified about it to my eyes. 
Yes vitiligo is exactly what it is haha I have a bunch of weird things. Turners Syndrome, I'm deaf, and vitiligo haha  
I lost two childhood friends in a car accident seven years ago when I was 17 years old and I never cried (or cried for something else since then) and ended up being a pretty cold and unfazed person from it.  Then earlier this spring I was just chilling one night listening to music while sipping on a Vanilla Coke. Out of the blue I remembered back to fourth grade when I was the new kid in school and my two new friends took me on a little adventure off school grounds (which was forbidden of course) to go buy something at a nearby grocery store. That's when we all tried Vanilla Coke for the very first time.  So I started thinking about shit like how that one adventure, or the other times we were together now only exists in my own clouded memory and eventually they will be gone forever.  All those suppressed feelings just came out of nowhere and I bawled my eyes out for like an hour. It really did feel great to have a good cry. I forgot how snotty you get though! 
Its strange cause I dont cry. I am an emotional person but it takes a lot to push me to tears.   But this was so sudden. Thanks btw! 
Where I live, in SE Asia, summers average 35* C. Moving to a place which hit 30* C once in the last 100 years! 
*Yeah, summer gets way too hot sometimes, but sometimes it's raining and I like when it's raining.* 
*What about late autumn when it's raining and it's dark?* 
Yup. Spring as a continuous season hasn't been a thing in awhile. Those 60-70 degree spurts from January to May mixed in with 25-50 degree weather kind of suck. It doesn't stay warm til June, even May has days where you need a coat. 
I love the summer. I don't mind the heat if it means it isn't snowing. Plus, winter means Christmas and that is just the *worst* holiday ever. Not to mention all the stupid cold snow that gets everywhere, people that somehow get worse at driving and did I mention the cold yet? Yeah, screw winter. If I wasn't obligated to live where I live, I would move to where winter doesn't exist. I hate that stupid season.  
Same. Plants are starting to bloom but there's not too many bugs yet, it's warm but it's not too hot yet, and lots of rain. Love it. 
*What about late fall when  it's dark and rainy all the time?* 
*Hey, Lizzy! I like spring, too. But I love autumn more. I love how melancholic everything is .* 
*Do you like the sea? I absolutely love to be by the sea when the sky is grey, there's little rain and heavy wind.* 
*I like that in the autumn the new seasons of my favourite TV shows start...* 
What about moving to a place where it's usually cold? Like Alaska or Canada  
Which equates to 2.5(ish) centimeters per inch so the average person who is 5 feet 8 inches is 170cm tall(not taking into account be quarter and half inches) 
No idea. I know the metric system, I just can't convert. 
"How tall are you?"  "-sharp inhale- 4'20""  "Nice."    So how tall is the average Chicago resident? 
I said almost exactly the same thing when the Honda finance guy tried to sell me an extended warranty. 
Excuse me I'm not from the US. Where else can one get a car if not from a dealership?! 
Yes--all the math throws them off! I hated that my husband had to save me but whatever.  
Uh, financially it actually makes sense if your lease payments include an interest. You actually pay less if you pay more up front. 
Glad to meet you here, Margaret! How have you been? 
Finishing a dissertation is pretty badass on it's own.  Things getting even better is awesome! 
I don't remember how I found it either, but I've never left.  :) 
I'm guessing you're in the Southern hemisphere then?  I've only really seen snow once.   
Wow, that's a lucky random click.    I'm sorry you're still not entirely thrilled with work, but at least it's a step in the right direction. 
I see what you did there, Brain.   But how will we get the pants on the monkeys? 
Yeah this flick is NOWHERE near that mature haha. CU was entertaining but I did read the books as a kid and I mainly went as a service to that 
If you read the books there are definitely a lot of shoutouts which I loved. But this is definitely a kids show with a TON of lowbrow humor 
Omg the references, Harold and George's over-the-top-ness and the sprinklings of more adult humor a la failings of the public school system did it for me. It definitely sated the nostalgic in me while my adult, mature side is "who the hell is this manchild, idk him. I'm gonna induce dissociative disorder to just get me the hell out of here" 
Omg I also really wanted to see F8 when that came out too. All my friends were like 'Bruh, your taste in movies suck.' I mean I do got tastes fir the unusual 
Omg going with some friends would def have gotten rid of most my shame. What inspired you guys fill watch it? 
I really enjoyed the references to the book. And they had some pretty nice political jokes about public schools. Animation was amazing. Other than that they really run the Poopypants name joke to the ground 
Def do that. Walking oitta that theater felt weeeeiiirrrddd 
I mean......it does have its adult funny moments but SOOOO much of the humor is child-level toilet humor which is to be expected. Definitely made for the kids more so than those who read them as kids.  If you have kids, bring them. You'll get a lot less weird looks coming out of the theater. If it goes on Netflix, watch it there and have no one else be all the wiser 
Yeah I figured after I walked out haha. If anyone asks me irl what I saw, Imma say I saw Megan Leavey 
Dealing while on probation. Sounds like a class act, that one. 
Most of my close friends from back then moved on, like you did, but the guy that texted me still lives in the area and last I'd heard, he was doing pretty well for himselr. I was just hoping he'd want to grab a beer and catch up. But nope, just wanted another pawn in his money game. 
Well, I suppose I'm glad the guy I talked to launched right into his pitch and didn't waste my time then!  
I've gathered since out chat that he's got a daughter, recently got engaged to his daughter's mother, and has a steady job. My guess is he was feeling infallible after his girlfriend gave birth, he got engaged, and started his job. It appears (based on his facebook account,) that those things happened, in that order, just before he got sucked in to this shitty scheme. So it seems he's doing fine, he's just naive and/or gullible. 
I've thought about it for that particular person, I am just waiting to see how it will go now...I may need to minimise our contact. I think, unfortunately, that he is still interested in me in a more-than-just-friends way though we've talked about it and I said I wasn't feeling the same way...who knows.   Thanks for the advice! 
Hi! I enjoy videogames too! Lets virtually hang out! 
Hm, you are right...I probably have to change my mentality and maybe the way I approach people and things. As for the friends, I think I am ready to say "enough is enough" if I feel too uncomfortable,  I am out of patience and I guess I might not be the most awesome friend but I can't exactly change myself now completely.    
Haha, well that is a good thing.   It gives you the higher ground I think! 
I actually think this way as well. The trouble starts when I notice that many people have a not so friendly stance and I start to wonder what I do wrong...  Maybe it's really nothing or maybe I should change something. Of course I won't become a hypocrite just so some people will like me but if I am wrong somewhere I need to know. 
You are right, I am sure I come off as cold to many people. I want to change that and I think I have, to a certain degree, but sometimes I cannot be consistent about it and I fall back to the old ways.   Still, it should be my focus if I want to make people comfortable in talking to me. 
Ahahahah, cool story.   Yeah a whack with a stick may solve any kind of problem. 
Thank you!  Yes, I felt this way too where I don't really care if everyone likes me, it is impossible after all.  However, I seem to notice that even my professors at university seem kinda weird around me. Well, not everyone but some do.  Maybe they do this with other people though so I might be reading too much into that.   I guess I have to accept that I am not as easy to like as other people might be since I am kind of distant inherently.  
Exactly, I am sure I have misinterpreted actions or words that people say to me, it's inevitable in this life and maybe I take some things more seriously than I should. I wish it were easy to know the intentions of others but sometimes you just gotta ask.   Maybe I'm just feeling low lately and that is why certain behaviours are impacting me more.  That was a great story and thank you for sharing it! Now if there's anything that bothers you, you can approach him as a friend and tell him. 
Those are some good advice! Thank you :)   I was actually thinking of doing some martial arts maybe next year so that would probably make me feel better and maybe get to know more people.   About that book, I think I read some chapters in the past it really is a very practical book.   I might need to read it once more though. 
Babies of animals are eaten and it is okay so, yeah got you there!   
At least we are not alone!   I actually thought about it being about looks and I thought the same thing as you. However, In the end I believe that it is most likely due to my low self esteem and bad mood showing in my face etc than anything else since even less attractive people have friends and are even more like able than some really good looking people who are distant, you know?  It has to do with people feeling comfortable approaching you and I know that I don't make ppl feel that way. I also don't make much eye contact which I think ppl might find suspicious so yeah.  I am still figuring this out but I think it can be solved though it won't be easy... 
Hey, I think that in your case it's probably people not understanding how you interact since you said you are not good at human interactions. I am not great either especially when I am tired and don't feel like putting the work to be friendly but that's cause I am mostly an introvert.  So, yeah people won't understand who you are deep inside since they only get to judge you from one or two conversations but don't bring yourself down. People who know you well value you so I am sure when others get to know you well enough they will see who you are.  Yeah, this friend of mine is kind of strict when it comes to friendship. I made a huge mistake lately for which I apologized but maybe he hasn't forgiven me yet :/. 
Thank you!  I am trying to have a good mindset even though there might be some negativity.   Well, everyone deals with that anyway. 
You sound like you have thought well about the situation you're in and are dealing it very maturely, that's good!   Obsessing about something certainly won't resolve it, I know so I will try to keep it in the back of my mind.  Also, what happens in school may seem very important but it is not that much. You realize that after you graduate. I was not a popular kid either, barely talked with half of my class but whatever.   
Ah yes, the internet can be a really cruel place.   Don't take it personally though, everyone is trolled or attacked by people who are going through tough times in the real world and need to vent somewhere.   Also, usually trolls are kids so yeah. 
Yeah, people are different when in groups. It requires a different approach in that setting since when there are many people it is difficult to really bond with everyone there.  But since you are good at interacting one on one I am sure you will be fine in larger groups..it usually requires commenting on what other people are saying or sharing a story or a joke. That's about it in my experience. 
You are not wrong. I am  not on my best psychological state lately and I know this is probably affecting how I seem to people.  It's just that I feel like I might never change and will always make a bad impression. Well, not to everyone but to many people.  It's probably not true though, I just got to work and better myself. 
Deeper connections are hard to come across but definitely one way to have one is by being with the same person daily as you said.  I know that I restrict myself with my personality sometimes in that I don't share a lot about myself or only superficial things and nothing really emotionally deep.  However, my friends rarely do the same so I guess we share that.  About the one that criticizes me, yes it is pretty annoying but at other times he is really cool to hang out and we communicate very well.   I guess, time will tell what needs to be done.  Thank you for the advice! 
I know, there's almost nothing in the world that another person hasn't gone or isn't going through it.  Time and patience is key, you are right.   Thank you! 
Well, I don't know if it's any x-factor, it's mostly that our group of friends has stayed this way for many years without any major fights at all-which is weird if you think about it- and I believe it is due to us being just superficial friends, we haven't shared many meaningful moments yet. However, we click in that we all have peaceful personalities I guess and respect each others boundaries.   Yes, I have to take criticisms and I do understand when I am objectively wrong on a matter. I understand that I am not perfect and I am going to make mistakes, all I can do is prevent them from happening another time and apologize.     
Haha, I get what you're saying. I think I feel this way a lot lately because I had my own problems for a while now and I became less tolerant to other people, not that I told them anything but I just didn't care much about my image I guess.   
It usually goes that way with people, no one is likeable by everyone.   I don't think I have depression because I know that there are people that like me it's just that, lately, some people seem to be negatively predisposed against me (or maybe that is what I make of their behaviour).   Of course, that is natural but I thought I'd whine about it for once haha. 
It's this opening up that I have a hard time doing, this has been my focus but I need a lot of work to manage to be an open person.   It's not impossible since I've made some steps but it doesn't come easy for me. 
True, all we can aim for is our best selves even if we never achieve our presumed "perfection".   I guess social stuff are rather overwhelming at times. 
Being honest is a good trait and I guess it shows confidence.   I get that being too popular might be tiring and kind of annoying in the end but at least you have some genuine friends, that is all that matters!  It is true that speaking my mind and saying what I believe is something that I like to do but maybe don't do as often because I am not really comfortable with speaking to strangers or ppl that I don't know well. I should definitely work on that as well.  Oh and I get that honesty can be harsh so I see why you might think that you are more unlikeable but at the same time everyone respects it so I don't think it is that bad. 
Ahh I would love that. My dog is asleep right now I will  surely go and cuddle with him when he wakes up :) 
Hell, why not look up the whole movie! It's great for laughs :) That and the holy grail are both hilarious. 
There is not much you guys can do tbh. This guy who I have been talking to for like the past 5 months or so who I thought was my friend just completely let me down after I said something about his behaviour how he treated another friend of mine. Just sucks that you go on to trust someone and think they are your friend but end up fucking you over and blaming you for it. Also had a test today which I completely ruined.  
Thanks. I'd like to think there is a market for what I do, but I am terrible at promoting my work. 
I've been wondering how to find someone to promote my work as I am crap at that. 
I tried that years ago. I didn't do great, I think because I was competing with mass produced items and I didn't understand the market. My work is ridiculously labor intensive. 
Thanks Todd. Means a lot coming from a fellow fabricator. 
Good catch on the Tuscaloosa. I have been a graphic novel fan for years, and a fan of good illustration generally. So much of children's lit is just a vehicle for the illustration. I don't know if or how it would get funded, but I think a pitch could be made for steel sculpture as illustration. 
Thank you so much. You're such a kind soul. This'll mean the world to him. Also I didn't know that but that's amazing ! Right now I'm able to put some of my paycheck towards food so he can eat but if there's a chance that we really need help in that department, I'll for sure head there. Thank you so much.  
Ooo thank you! I had no idea that this was a thing! 
Thank you love! Either way, I appreciate it so much.  
Number 3 and It's half truth because you are only half boy (? 
Professor Layton can help me here: the first can't be false, because the second and third one contradict with each other, so the question is simply, "is it true that you played a metal gig in front of a hundred people"? And I say, why not?  So I think number 3 is false. 
I'll complete the trio of guesses with Number Tres 
TIL Nebuchadnezzar isnt just the name of a ship in the matrix 
I don't know how you could possibly make up number 3, it takes imagination. I think it's number 2 
Lol same, I struggled to think of another truth to use  But I'll venture a guess and say number 3 is the lie 
WOW, your grandfather IS the American Football Hall of Fame?  
being an eagle scout is quite an achievement and I makes sense that you would put it there if it was true. Number 3 is absolutely possible so I'm guessing that it's 1 
What do you consider good knowledge on music and movies? 
There is a poodle sanctuary in my city so I'm ready to believe that. The one about the blackberries seems too silly to be true however 
1 is really specific. On number 2 you're having to explain the concept of the skill, which would make it an inconvenient answer to make up. Number 3 is very vague and details were probably left out to make it seem more incredible. I'm gonna go with number one. 
Ok 1 and 2 are REALLY cool, but I'm gonna guess the third one is a lie. If it's only half-truth, I'd guess you only ate one pizza-sized pancake not 2 
I think 1 is false. 2 is a lot more common than most people think and you have water in your username, so 3 makes sense. 
I'm going with no.1. I want to come up with some cool explanation, but then I'll look dumb when you tell me I'm wrong.  
Number 3 is my guess as it's the least related, but maybe you did that on purpose. 
I wanna believe all of these are true but I'm gonna say number 3 
1? You've been pronounced dead 3 times now, haven't you? 
Sorry to read this :(   *Nana internet hug*  You take care. Better days ahead! 
Man, what a missed opportunity.  At the very least OP should have got a coffee date out of this. 
Lol yeah it does. But in a comedy, the guy's usually not too socially awkward to ask the girl out haha 
I've learnt to look up too, a lot of people are nicer than you may think, most smile back. It's nice to see someone smiling, brightens your day a bit immediately! 
It sure does lol. Sounds crazy, a similar thing happened to me - I was at a music festival like 400 km's away, when I got back home I met a random guy with the wristband in a small shop. 
Shame it didn't work out. I never pick up the courage, that's my problem 
Lol right? I just felt like it was long overdue and I wanted to show my appreciation for all that he does for me. He deserved a good b day this year. Plus I'm stoked AF for third eye blind next month! Lol. 
I hope you get it soon! Everyone deserves a good surprise party. 
Damn that made me feel really good. We have been through some SHIT trust me. I think we are finally at a point where it's all love and no more immature bullshit that comes with being with someone since highschool. Thank you that really means alot.  
Because we are really big on fishing & redfish are just cool to me lol.  Thank you! 
that's why none of my fish trawler workers will talk to anyone isn't it 
We talked a bit when he came into my work. My friend who's a cashier and knows what he looks like has told me he's come in when I'm not there, looks around a bit and leaves. He say's hi when we pass each other but I honestly think he may just be an out going friendly guy who talks to everyone.   I'm just a painfully shy person, last time I talked to him I turned bright red. I don't actually know how to flirt like a normal person either, I'm either too blunt and forward or too subtle.   
Him but you're completely right. I keep kicking myself over it and I keep getting more chances and blowing it.  
I feel the same way with all the other girls, I'm not really classically pretty I'm short with short hair and everyone else is so pretty there. I was so close to talking to him today then I saw him talking to a beautiful girl and boom I grew feathers and flew out of there.  
I'm going to have to say its not pathetic, mainly because that's how most of my crushes go.  
unless one of us goes at a different time through out the week or he comes into my work again it may not be until next weekend, but i will update. 
The front door is definitely unlocked. I can see it from here haha.  
I called our after-hours maintenance. The lockout fee is $500! 
My finger doesn't make any noise when it strikes my palm. 
Yes there is a skin glue. Dermabond. Commonly used for lacerations that aren't complex enough to require stitches or staples. It's basically super glue. 
"So. Tell us more about how you glue the wood to the other wood." -__- 
To me, bugs and spiders are more scary than big bears for some reason 
Were you afraid of animals/snakes/insects when you lived there? 
I read awhile age that it was an inactive account; the moderators then took it, and gave it to him. 
This is by far the most important thing a president can do if they really want to make a change. And it's not just about elections. It's about how laws are made. How we govern ourselves. How we protect our future 
Please allow copyright terms to actually end at some point. A public domain is vital. Please do not allow Hollywood, Chris Dodd and the RIAA to write all copyright laws. 
The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan.  Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you.  The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014.  But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget. 
Thank you for getting NBC to televise this question.   You da man. 
I think we all knew that this issue would not be addressed. Though it is very important to many of us, his administration's stance on the issue does not shed a favorable light on their campaign and likely will not be addressed.  
My primary concern as a medical marijuana patient in the state of California is how Obama has backtracked on his previous stance regarding state regulation & federal "uninvolvement." To this day, many of the dispensaries I frequent have been raided by the DEA, guns drawn, and our meds have been taken away. It's unfair and it forces many patients back into the black market. I guess I'm just wondering if you plan to continue signing off on these malicious raids into your second term, or if you'd rather focus on much more pressing issues like our national debt, unemployment and the war in the middle east. (I'd like my friends back from Afghanistan.) 
Finally, I CTRL + F'ed "NDAA" and this is the only thing that came up. Don't expect this to be addressed at any point during the campaign, he's not going to try to defend it because it's indefensible. 
Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices. 
Or a picture of him holding a cat with the caption "I R THA PRESIDENT" 
This is an awesome question, although potentially dangerous to answer. 
As a secondary point, what role do you think states' rights (surrounding drug legalization) will play in the rest of your presidency?  
It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD! 
If it's not Louis C.K. or Neil deGrasse Tyson you've lost all of reddit's votes. 
He will need help from the Canadian prime minister. 
He signed an order closing it, and Congress denied funding to put it into effect. 
Yeah, because this is a fairly worded question on the issue 
to be fair, the DOJ has challenged a bunch of these laws in courts 
My mother is a public teacher. No Child Left Behind did not help. We need to ensure that our teachers get the support they need to be amazing and give a good education to students! Can you, Mr. President, make the job of "teacher" more prestigious, competitive, and reputable?  
How about the tuition problem that's creating the loans? 
I'd like to see how he responds, given that there doesn't seem to be any set deadline for the closing of Guantanamo, nor has he definitively taken one side or the other on marijuana legislation. 
Exactly! Does no one on this bloody site understand what a nondisclosure agreement is? 
Could you shed some light on the "last employee"? Don't think I was around for that one.  
You either die an admin or live long enough to see yourself host your own AMA 
She could however talk about what she's going to do in the future and speak around anything an NDA would cover. 
More than that, I'm sure she signed an additional non-disparagement agreement in order to get her severance and continue benefits. Can't blame her.  Now, if someone else is somehow able to get the true story from her, he/she could convey it in a way that doesn't peg her as the source.  
It actually made it to 14K upvotes (twice). Both times upvotes were suddenly cut in half. Now its at 5K. Something's definitely up. 
Which they can, now. It's one, big, gay, whistleblower wedding! 
Ne questions, it just gets gilded like a million times.   Actually that would mean buying gold. Idk. Some shit along those lines.  
My guess is they are prepping for   1. Sale to an outside company.   2. Pay access.   And ditching people with issues with 1 and/or 2.   But im wrong a lot.  
Reddit's largest stake holder is Conde Nast, which is a subsidiary of Advance Publications, a multi-billion dollar enterprise. I really doubt any bigwig's contract includes a clause about getting bonuses of $4  
She got fired by the company. The website loves her.   
We might be taking a break from "Reddit Gold" for a while AutoModerator. 
What if she liked Dr. Pepper, ever thought of that smart Guy?  
Everyone on the stage wrote their own questions.  We shared them with the moderators, then the mods got to as many as possible while maintaining the flow of the debate. 
I saw a man with no teeth and no shoes standing on a corner in my new hometown when I moved there 3 years ago as I'm driving the moving van.  Here I am bringing all my stuff to a bigger, better house, thinking what hot shit I am for affording the place.    Then I see him and realize that he has literally nothing but the sign in his hand.  People driving by him giving him no more mind than a street sign or a shrub.  I drove on by, reasoning that I was too busy to stop and help him out, it was moving day.  Somebody else will give him a couple bucks.  I never saw him again.    Is he OK?  Did he move on out of town?  Turn his life around?  Die in a gutter OD'd on heroin?  I'll never know cause I didn't give him the time of day.  I was too busy pretending I had arrived.    These are people who deserve love and happiness as much as me or anyone.  But that day to me he was a shrub.  Never again. 
Too many weird, wild things to count.  The most surreal was hearing back from @midnight which I love. 
Fake internet points are the best compensation.  Except money.  I likes money. 
Gallup does a random sampling of undecided voters in the area in which the debate is held.  This time it was my home town and I was lucky enough to answer when they called. 
Between that and what South Park might turn me into I'm pumped.  I know Bobby Moynihan would crush the bit, but maybe go Leslie Jones for shock value or something?  I don't know.  I'll get with my writers. 
St. Patrick center provides temporary housing, job training, drug counseling, and help with mental health issues.  There is a severe homelessness problem in this country.  Most of us are one or two paychecks away from being homeless as well.  We need to start seeing and intervening on their behalf.   
I'm already the sexy Ken Bone so I'm thinking bust out the old Jedi robe / lightsaber combo and be Obi Wan Kenboni 
We need more clean plants like mine to be approved for construction.  Older plants can't retrofit to be best in class environmentally because it would drive them out of business. That means we need newer ones manned by the displaced workers from those being retired. 
Be who you are.  If people don't like who you are, they're not the right people to have in your life. 
Several companies have approached me for endorsements. I have 2 rules for working with them.  1)It's a responsible company that I believe in and that I vet to the best of my ability.  I will do my best not to associate with any companies that hurt the environment or their workers.  2)  10% of all money I receive must go to my local preferred homeless charity the Saint Patrick Center in Saint Louis, MO.  Same rules for paid appearances. 
My uncle called me today and seemed genuinely star struck as if we hadn't been drinking beer together the week before. 
Radiohead is my all time favorite, nobody blends genres like Thom Yorke and the boys. 
I know I look old cause I'm fat and bald and dress like it's 1954, but I'm only 34 and ineligible to run!  There are over 2000, yes 2000 legally registered candidates.  One of them must have something to offer.  Get your voice out there for one of them.  
Obviously reducing energy usage in the winter by providing everyone with stylish red cable knit sweaters, duh.  
He talked to me about the peak of the coal industry in the 20s and how it has evolved with the nation's infrastructure over the years.    Then his security team reminded him that it was time to go yet again.  I think his wife was waiting on him. 
On soft ball and hockey rec teams I wore 18 for the great 60s era Saint Louis Cardinal Mike Shannon.  He's been the voice of the Cardinals basically my whole life.  Stan Gibson is for Stan Musial and Bob Gibson. 
He sort of? answered this on his Jimmy Kimmel appearance I think, basically said he turned on his cell phone as soon as he was allowed and had a thousand+ messages lol 
I'm sorry you're confused, Ken Bone is the cable knit sweater wearing a fat guy. 
Ken Bone does not ask.  He commands by his imposing yet cuddly presence. 
Yes, definitely.  Being undecided is not the same as being indecisive.  We just have a lot to consider this election.   
My power plant supports a robust drug testing policy, sorry Dogg.  My dad on the other hand is all in. 
I'm close, but I will not be announcing my decision.  I want you to all make up your own minds.  Don't rely on my opinion, just the positive message. 
It's been unreal, both the good and the bad.  Everybody has responded to the positive message with the exception of a few nuts.  Some of the stuff makes it tough to stay positive, but I try to spin it for the good.  For instance, I've had almost a quarter million new Twitter followers, and only 3 death threats.  Great ratio!  Seriously though, thanks to my home town PD for making me feel safe when the creeps come out to play. 
I wanted to hear more about environmental protection from Mr. Trump, and more about jobs from Secretary Clinton.   They both did alright, but all answers from politicians are pretty much canned and rehearsed.  Kinda like the ones I do on the radio. 
It was a bad call.  I need to fire my agent, except I can't because I'm my agent. 
It's flattering, but please don't.  I cannot serve since I'm not old enough. 
Somebody set one up on my behalf, but Jimmy Kimmel is buying me a new one since I did his show.  I guess if go fund me sends me that money it'll go to the charity.    You'll see me wearing it on his show next week. 
I had this weird hallucination where all the sudden everyone gave a shit what I had to say.  Bizarre. 
I don't even go to HOA meetings,  but if I really thought I could effect positive change I'd consider it. 
I'm in LA late next week, maybe we can hook up. Big fan here. My dad wants to roll wit da Dogg big time, you me and him could do some tight stuff.  That didn't sound cool at all, did it? 
Without our future generations of doctors we can never solve the healthcare dilemma in this country! You are the future! You are going to improve the lives of your future patients and their families every day for the rest of your life!  Stick it out, I know you are sacrificing a lot, but they need you. 
We both worked at a bowling alley in Granite City called AMF Bowland.  I was a lane attendant which meant I walked around cleaning, throwing away beer bottles, and getting stuff from storage over to the bar and snack bar to restock during shift.  She worked the snack bar, which meant I did none of the stuff listed above.  I just watched her clean the grill cause when she bent to scrub it I could see dat ass was fat. 
Only the head nurse was able to speak up about it.   
Any president would be instantly twice as good for the country with this one simple step.  Appoint experts in each respective field to cabinet positions.  NOT political donors or old friends I owed a favor.   2nd action, get blasted at camp David till I pass out. 
I have 4 cats. 1) Angel Female, a mostly white calico.  She was a Christmas present to my wife.  We were too broke for me to get her a gift while I was working through school.  I surprised her with a kitten that a coworkers cat had.  I wrapped a cat collar in an old jewelry clamshell and put it under the tree.  Heather and Angel are friends forever.  2) Daisey - Female, a tortie with white gloves and ascot.  My BFF.  She was a full grown cat we adopted from a shelter at about 1 year of age the Christmas after Angel.  3)  Zero - Male.  My son named him after the Borderlands character.  Black with wisps of gray.  Rescued from the shelter as a little kitten.  Chosen by our son.  Name changed from Ringo when we adopted him.  4)  Shadow - Male.  An asshole we lured inside.  He was a stray living in our storm drain, a small kitten weaned too early.  Heater got him inside.  He loves to piss on stuff sometimes, but for some reason we still like him. 
They have been thinking it since the days of my great grandfather (swear on my life it's true) Bentley Bone and his son, my great uncle Oriel (pronounced Oral) Bone. 
When it's cold in your jail cell.  I'm not big on stripes.   
What's an NFL?  I'm from St. Louis, something called an NFL has abandoned my twice in my lifetime already.  That's more times than a typical dead beat dad and still they want my money.  Not happening. 
The mods got to as many as time permitted, but we did not know the order.  The reason is, let's say the economy discussion is going great, they do another audience question on it.  Name calling gets out of hand again? Total topic change, skip all the rest on the economy.  Because of this mod controlled flow we got a better discussion, but the audience has no warning that their question is coming. 
Had a goatee for a while, full on neck beard for about a year.  Clean shaven for a long time.  The stache is for my grandpa, the first Ken Bone who tied in (not lost, it died too) his battle with cancer two days before Christmas last year.  His stache was unparalleled.   
I breathe the same air and drink the same water as you.  My job doesn't change that.  We only get one Earth and we're doing a shit job taking care of her.  I feel that my plant is operating in a responsible way, but as a whole we are going to need big energy innovation if we want our grand kids to have the same planet we do. 
Congrats on getting out, and best of luck on your recovery! I would also love to read your AMA if you ever feel up to it.  
Yes, every "therapy room" is equipped with cameras and listening devices, as admitted by the "Church."  Do they use it for blackmail? No, they use it to discredit you when you speak out.  
When you reach the top of The Bridge (OTP 8) you will be told that God is a lie for LRH, and there are more levels ahead, that will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. There is no end to Scientology.   
I am an SP (supressive person). You are not allowed to be in contact with an SP. I would love to talk to my former friends and see my goddaughter.  
Weird reactions? No. I got appropriate reactions, "Why are you in this crazy shit?"  
I felt alone. If you ever confided in friends then you were (as policy dictates)... reported and turned in. Very 1984, very George Orwell.  
Do I think? I know. Hi Karin Pouw and members of OSA! If any Sea Org member is currently reading this and works for OSA and wants to leave, I will help you... including Karin.  
Most Scientologists are 2nd or 3rd generation, they were born and raised into an ideology and have been surrounded and isolated. It is all they know. They are victims. Most of the original Scientologists are all out and have spoken out. Unfortunately, their children were indoctrinated by them.... are still loyal, faithful and have cut off communication due to the policy of disconnection.  
Because i was taught to believe that the controversy was due to people being unaware of what Scientology was truly doing in the world which was good things. I also felt the press was focused on making fun of Scientology and not what was important, so it was easy to turn away from the information. And also a major part of Scientology is learning how to fight your critics. If i wasn't fighting I wasn't being a good Scientologist.  
Speak to your local councilmen/women about cracking down on the abuse of its citizens. I believe people have influences, they know judges, lawyers, police enforcement I think everyone bringing attention to these abuses can help. It takes a community to police itself.  
The higher up is singular. And he definitely knows. however I believe most parishioners and Sea Org members  (people who work for the "church") are int he dark and believe that they are doing amazing things for the world. And David Miscavige is directly responsible for that fraud.  
Long term struggle, however, seeing the "church" attack those who were speaking out, those who gave their life, life savings, their children to this organization that were once considered exemplary Scientologists or staff members of the church to being liars, bitter apostates, and what ever vile sophomoric, vitriolic adjective they can find overnight says a lot about the organization.  
If you want to get them out there is no way to do it nicely. There is no way to do it quietly. You have to challenge them by saying, "If you can think for yourself, if you have truly accomplished what scientology says you have accomplished, you should be able to speak freely on any subject. If you have completed the "PTS/SP Course" you should be able to confront and shatter suppression." You should ask them how is it then that you can't watch a movie called Going Clear or look on the internet if you are the elite of the planet and handling the planet's ills if you can't think for yourself. I only hope that your challenge will get them to simply look.  
It's very upsetting. I'm only an actress with a short window of interest. So it is up to the authorities who have to do something about it and the judges who are hearing cases of abuse, coerced abortions, being held prisoner, fraud, mental and emotional imprisonment. They won't look at cases to decide its a religion. They have to separate and look at the law. Your doctrine is abusive. It mandates that you abuse people.  
The policies of the "Church" are the policies of the "Church." They will not change, and there will be someone right behind him ready to pick up where he left off.  
Yes my first reaction was "Are you all fucking nuts?" and then I looked at my mother and said "What kind of bullshit did you get me in?" My only option was to leave, but at the time my family was not ready to go. The "church" told me I didn't need to believe it, just do it. And they always pose this question: "Are you ready to leave everything you've ever known?" 
I was punished for doing Stuff magazine because it was too racy. They would not want us to do anything that would be considered not "becoming of a Scientologist." I see they have since changed their stance of what they believe is "becoming of a Scientologist."  
If you really look at the numbers at the entertainment industry, in comparison to the small number of scientologists that are celebrities, the number wouldn't even register. I think Scientology has done an amazing job convincing people that there is a great number of celebrities in the "Church."  
They gain a purpose. They gain a group. They gain a sense of accomplishment (awards, certificates). They gain an education that in the real world LRH states would be equivalent to getting a "PHD in life." You become an elitist. That you have all the answers in life. If you have a question about life, you are made to think that Scientology has the answer.  
I have read stories on the internet. I was told personally by a few people that I personally know that there was sexual abuse. When I was 16 and working for a "senior Scientologist" who was in his late 30's, he had sex with a 16 year old friend of ours. And the "Church" handled it internally. All abuses are dealt within the "Church" as it is an enemy act in the "Church" to prosecute another member. Please do not take my word for it, just google the words "Scientology and sexual abuse."  
I am. I'm okay with it because I knew what I was getting into and I knew the policies of the "church" and what would happen by my speaking out against it.  
Great question. Because very early on in the brainwashing process, L. Ron Hubbard's "technology" teaches you that outside sources (i.e. The news, the Internet, books, magazines) are ALL LIES and hellbent on destroying something decent like Scientology. The AMA, and APA, and all "governments" do not give scientology its due because they have a vested interest in not healing people and not helping people. And Scientology is in the business of making people better. So Scientologists are taught that their safest bet is to get their info from the only true decent people...and those are Scientologists. And if they look on the internet, if they read time mag, they will be met with punishment at their expense. And, as a Scientologist...you have to confess that you've read outside materials, and that will be met with punishment at your expense.  
The policy of the "Church" does not allow them to come to me. Former high ranking Sea Org members like Debbie Cook and former members like Katie Holmes are forbidden to speak to other SPs. Certain members are forced to sign agreements that does not allow them to speak to ex members.  
Thank you! Watch our show tonight and spread awareness. It is bigger what people think. This religion is massive.  
Was she on antidepressants or any mood stabilizers?  Scientology's vehement anti-drug policy might have gotten her off medication that was keeping her happy and (relatively) sensible about sleep, sex, cleanliness, etc.  In another post, Leah did mention suicides happening for presumably that very reason. 
I would say the "church's" Fair Game policy, and how they systematically go after anyone who publicly speaks out against them. Anyone who speaks out against the "church" is seen as an enemy.  
When I was a Scientologist I saw Hollywood as a dark, lost bunch of souls that needed saving. Now I see it as any other business and that we're all just trying to do right by ourselves, right by our friends and family and that people outside of scientology are not bad.  
Yes my view of religion changed in that I am no longer a bigot against people's religious beliefs when it doesn't harm other people, promote killing people for their beliefs... like extremism. But if religion brings you comfort, hope, and a sense of community, I say "whatever works for you."  
No, and if they did hear about it, we were told that those claiming abuse were lying. Then I would have been interrogated and even punished for asking.  
The "Church" doctrine thinks that fields of psychology and psychiatry are a sham. They deny mental illness and afflictions. They promote that you can heal your psycho-sematic issues with their "technology." They will get in the way of people taking medications. They will prevent people from getting the real medical help that they need. and in some cases have caused suicides because of it. Scientology is mentally abusive because we are all taught that we are responsible for everything.  
I'm sure there were tools that helped me to be able to communicate better, not be nervous when I walked in the room. Acting classes would have been cheaper. Or maybe staying in Brooklyn a little longer would have been more beneficial to my acting career.  
We had special course rooms in separate parts of the buildings. Any complaint we had about the outside world was met with agreement from the "Church." We were serviced differently, we had supervisors doing courses in our homes, giving special schedules to celebrities. Staff was interrogated by the Church. Often times there were Sea Org members working for celebrities in their homes, personally working for them.  I know of one celeb who had a sea org member working in their home and sea org members were averaging $25/week. The labor laws don't apply to any church therefor they were made to work ungodly hours, forced into interrogations if making human mistakes around the celebrity.  
Doesn't look like got to this comment, but she said in another response that her first step to leaving was how quickly the "church" would turn on anyone who wronged them, even people who dedicated their lives to Scientology.  
No, I'm not an atheist. It's not about being anything now. I do have faith in God. I do not judge people for their faith. I judge people who use religion to hurt people. I don't believe in a religion that shuns people for their beliefs, or that you should hurt people for their beliefs.  
That's not downvotes, that's just a Reddit algorithm to prevent posts from staying on the front page too long. It's perfectly normal  
Greater awareness. Exposing the truths. Not letting to continue to let them bully people into silence and submission.  
They don't tell you about Xenu until you're at OT III - Operating Thetan level 3. You won't get that far until you've spent many thousands on auditing and classes. Most people never make it that far.  The thing is, Xenu is actually an incredibly important part of the religion. It's the explanation of why there is so much suffering on earth. It'd be like if Christianity didn't let you know about the crucifixion until you'd donated egregious sums of money to your church. 
I'm a big fan of Louis Theroux, but I thought that was one of his worst documentaries.  Going Clear was a much better doc on the subject IMO. 
I believe in Germany Scientology is not considered a religion and so is not granted charitable status.  Can you believe these feckers get to pay no tax everywhere else in the world, and particularly the USA?  ETA: It looks like Reddit is infiltrated with a Scientology posting filter. Apparently "you are doing that too much. try again in 5 minutes." when I tried to post this. Utterly absurd. 
She grew up in the religion. Her mother left when she did. 
I sometimes wear a hat. For example when I did college tours with my son I wanted the focus to be totally on him. A lot less people recognize me when I have a hat on or else they realize I am trying to be incognito.  Mostly when people do recognize me they are super nice so I don't feel it is a burden to be noticed most of the time.   
I would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn't very good socially back then but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that - maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up.... 
Australia is particularly nice. It is summer there when it is winter here so going there in December and January is especially nice. I spent Thanksgiving there last year.  I have gotten to travel to a lot of great places like the Amazon in Brazil which I recommend. 
The big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do. There is a lot of work going on in this field - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, academia,... Right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test.  Another whole area is vaccines. We need a vaccine for HIV, Malaria and TB and I hope we have them in the next 10-15 years. 
I would say education is the key problem. If you can solve that then it helps with a lot of things.  Maybe I didn't understand the question - maybe it supposed to be some idiosyncratic thing that bothers me.... 
A lot of people feel a sense of isolation. I still wonder if digital tools can help people find opportunities to get together with others - not Tinder but more like adults who want to mentor kids or hang out with each other. It is great that kids go off and pursue opportunities but when you get communities where the economy is weak and a lot of young people have left then something should be done to help. 
We need clean, reliable cheap energy - which we don't have. It is too bad the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. The Economist had a good piece on this this week. So we need some invention - perhaps miracle batteries or super safe nuclear or making sun into gasoline directly. 
It is super important to improve our healthcare system - both to reduce chronic disease but if we don't do better health costs will squeeze out spending on all other government functions.  I agree it is surprising how tough it has been to get digital medical records right and to learn from looking at those records.  Still there are some very promising things going on. For example the idea of looking at a blood sample to find cancer very early so it can be treated. We will be able to use genomic data to tune treatments.  There are a few big problems like diabetes, obesity and neurological conditions including Alzheimer's that we really need to solve. 
Overall like Warren Buffett I am optimistic about the long run. I am concerned in the short run that the huge benefits of how the US works with other countries may get lost. This includes the aid we give to Africa to help countries there get out of the poverty trap. 
I just went on a trip with my 17 year old son to see 6 colleges. He is a junior in High School and trying to figure out where he should go. Trips like that have been a great way to spend time together. He reads even more about politics than I do so I let him pick books for me to read.  Melinda is very creative about helping me find chances to spend time with the kids. Even just driving them to school is a great time to talk to them.   
I'm responding to you so that I can be higher than the guy talking about Bill Gates exploiting people.  
 I know he's said in the past that he has no interest in being President, but we *desperately* need a science minded President.    If we're going to start electing businessmen to the Presidency again, I'd at least like one like Bill Gates, who is forward thinking, pragmatic, and best of all, compassionate.   I'd be honored to vote for the man, personally. 
Not Bill Gates but...  One of my professors told me the best way to answer this question. Look through the job announcement and find something on it that you don't know how to do. When the interviewer asks you what your weakness is you can say "I've never worked with x program but I've worked with y program and am a fast learner" or something similar.  That way they know you've read through the announcement and they're aware that you might not have the exact training they want, but you have something similar and can be easily trained how they want.   It's a way to say something you're bad at but in a good way 
I hope his administration will decide that funding R&D to invent the next generation of energy (clean, cheap, reliable) is a good deal for the US and for the world. Climate change requires cooperation between countries over a period of decades but we don't have much time to waste. 
Whistleblower protection laws, a strong defense of the right for someone charged with political crimes to make any defense they want (currently in the US, someone charged with revealing classified information is entirely prohibited from arguing before the jury that the programs were unlawful, immoral, or otherwise wrongful), and support for the development of technically and legally protected means of communications between sources and journalists.  The sad truth is that societies that demand whistleblowers be martyrs often find themselves without either, and always when it matters the most. 
Thanks for the kind words. I definitely consider myself a journalist, as well as an artist and a filmmaker. In my mind, it's not a question about whether I am one or the other. Documentary films needs to do more than journalism - they need to communicate something that is more universal. 
Thank so much Miss Poitras! We are all proud of you! Cheers! 
Yes, I do plan to release more footage from Hong Kong shoot. On the first day we met Ed, Glenn conducted a long interview (4-5 hours) that is extraordinary. I also conducted a separate interview with Ed re: technical questions. The time constraints of a feature film made it impossible to include everything. I will release more.    I also filmed incredible footage with Julian Assange/WikiLeaks that we realized in the edit room was a separate film. 
Thank you for asking. My main question for Mr. Snowden is a technical one. How did you get so many questions planted in your AMA so effectively? With my presidential resources I was only able to get about a dozen questions prepared in advance and upvoted in my AMA along with my canned answers. (There are only so many interns in the White House.) You must be utilizing Russian intel to manipulate reddit so effectively. How do you do it? Tell me and I'll knock 3 months off your supermax prison life sentence. Thanks in advance. -B 
/u/falcon4287 have you considered the implications for your friend if he were known by his employer to have said something significantly different from what he's told you? 
One of the biggest problems in governance today is the difficulty faced by citizens looking to hold officials to account when they cross the line. We can develop new tools and traditions to protect our rights, and we can do our best to elect new and better representatives, but if we cannot enforce consequences on powerful officials for abusive behavior, we end up in a system where the incentives reward bad behavior post-election.   That's how we end up with candidates who say one thing but, once in power, do something radically different. How do you fix that? Good question. 
Hey guys, sorry -- the reddit mods are being a little weird. My account is /u/SuddenlySnowden.   Mods: Can you pull back the ban?  I can't post from the primary account. Thanks. 
Given the fact that I had been repeatedly detained at the U.S. border because of my work on previous films, I moved to Berlin to edit Citizenfour.   When Ed contacted me in early 2013 I gave him my assurance I would never comply with a subpoena. Before going to Hong Kong I met with many lawyers to assess the risk. I ignored some of the warnings - for instance the Washington Post urged me not to travel to Hong Kong. Another lawyer said not to bring my camera.   In the end I decided I could not live with the decision to not travel to Hong Kong.  
Probably went to the bathroom. Makes running easier. 
Thanks. The film will be out on DVD sometime in the summer, but we're still working on the exact date.  
The major issue in terms of our electoral system is truly campaign finance reform. Right now, we are at a moment in history where the Koch brothers and other billionaires are in the process of buying politicians and elections. We need to overturn Citizens United with a constitutional amendment. We need to pass disclosure legislation. We need to move toward public funding of elections. We also have got to see an increased federal role in the outrageous gerrymandering that Republican states have created and in voter suppression. These are the main issues that I'll be tackling in the coming months. 
As the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, I share your concern very deeply. The recently-passed Republican budget makes massive cuts in almost every governmental agency, including those engaged in our scientific research. This is a disaster. If we are going to address the major health issues facing our society -- Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, etc. -- we need to invest more in research and develop the best research centers in the world. 
My first effort would be to rally the American people to demand that Congress pass a progressive agenda which reverses the decline of our middle class. We have got to create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, we've got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, we've got to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and we have to transform our energy system in order to protect us from climate change. If the American people are politically active and demand that Congress act on their behalf, we can accomplish those goals and much more. 
I voted against the USA Patriot Act and voted against reauthorizing the USA Patriot Act. Obviously, terrorism is a serious threat to this country and we must do everything that we can to prevent attacks here and around the world. I believe strongly that we can protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights and I worry very very much about the huge attacks on privacy that we have seen in recent years -- both from the government and from the private sector. I worry that we are moving toward an Orwellian society and this is something I will oppose as vigorously as I can. 
I voted against the war in Iraq and I voted against the first Gulf War. I am strongly opposed to sending American combat troops into Iraq and Syria. At the end of the day, the war against ISIS will only be won when the Muslim countries in the area fully engage and defeat ISIS and other groups that are distorting what Islam is supposed to be about. The United States and other western countries should be supportive of the efforts of those governments, but cannot lead them. The nightmare, which I believe a number of Republicans want to see, is perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East. 
Excellent questions. You are right. People in general and young people in particular are increasingly alienated and disillusioned with the political process. The middle class is disappearing, the rich get richer, young people cannot afford college, the crisis of climate change is ignored, and Congress continues on its merry way paying attention to the needs of billionaires and multinational corporations. The truth is that we are in a very difficult political moment. But despair of giving up is just not an option. I would not be doing what I am doing if I did not believe that this country could provide health care to all as a right; that we could lead the world in transforming our energy system and dealing with climate change; that we could make education affordable for all. My strong belief is that it is imperative that we maintain our vision of what American can be, and that we fight hard to make that happen. DO NOT GIVE UP. 
So long as you have Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, and so long as you have a Congress dominated by big money, I can guarantee you that the discussion about universal basic income is going to go nowhere in a hurry. But, if we can develop a strong grassroots movement which says that every man, woman and child in this country is entitled to a minimum standard of living -- is entitled to health care, is entitled to education, is entitled to housing -- then we can succeed. We are living in the richest country in the history of the world, yet we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country and millions of people are struggling to put food on the table. It is my absolute conviction that everyone in this country deserves a minimum standard of living and we've got to go forward in the fight to make that happen. 
Someone should get on this. Bernie needs those small or big ;) donations.  
The answer is that everything depends upon the kind of strong grassroots movement that we can develop. If we do not have tens of millions of people actively involved in the political process, there is very little that any president can do because of the power of big money over the political and economic process. So what I have said time and time again is that we need a political revolution in this country, which means that 80 percent. of the people vote, not 40 percent, and which means that people demand that Congress represent the middle class and working families of this country and not just the billionaire class. 
Sanders as opposed to Obama has a record to support his claim that he is not the status quo. This doesn't mean things will be different if he is elected. The president isn't a king. 
Help us educate and organize and spread the message of what this campaign is about. If every American understood that 99 percent of all new income generated in this county today goes to the top 1 percent, and that the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, millions of people would join us in fighting for a political revolution so that Washington represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors. So, as this campaign evolves, we are going to ask you to knock on doors, talk to people, get on the phone and help us transform the American political system. Thanks for your support. 
1. Great question. Given the fact that Latin America is our next-door neighbor, I have been very distressed about the lack of attention that we have paid to Latin America. I applaud President Obama's effort to normalize relations with Cuba, a country which I have visited on several occasions. But I think much more can be done to bring the United States and Latin America closer and to improve relationships with a continent that faces many economic and social problems.  2. No I don't think six debates are enough and we will be interacting with the DNC to try to create a situation where we have as many debates as possible. There are huge issues facing our country. Candidates are entitled to different points of view. The American people need to hear a serious discussion on these issues, so I hope there will be far more debates than what the DNC has proposed. 
As somebody who has consistently voted to end discrimination in all forms -- who voted against DOMA way back in the 1990s -- I will do all that I can to continue our efforts to make this a nondiscriminatory society, whether those being discriminated against are transgender, gay, black or Hispanic. 
Hope he answers this. I support his policies, but I'd like to see him answer some questions from conservatives.  
He's going to avoid talking about guns  completely, which probably is smart. He already has far left voters probably, but if he wants center votes he can't hate on guns. 
And not just space exploration, but also the vital role they play in monitoring climate conditions. 
I had an amazing doubled pork chop with rhubarb. Now rhubarb is something we literally eat with desserts, but this dish was incredible. It was in Spain. It was a double pork-chop that had been slow-roasted over an open pit fire with rhubarb. Absolutely delicious. This was one of my mates that was trying to show off cooking in his back garden in Spain when we were out filming for KITCHEN NIGHTMARES. I didn't think it was going to work, to be honest.  And then when I started tasting, I thought *Shit! This is delicious!*  
Ehm - you know, sometimes it doesn't happen until 2-3 days later. No, I've never really got *sick,* but i was in a hotel last year in Vermont, and I didn't realize until I got home that I caught *nits* in the hotel.  Yeah.  And I did something really bad-  because I thought it was my daughter. I thought it was my youngest daughter, Matilda, and then it turns out it was *ME* with the nits. So I had my hair checked by my wife Tara, and I traced it back to the pillowcase in Vermont! So I apologized to Matilda. Because, you know, she's young and quite often kids get nits, and then my wife said "Listen, you're wrong. Tilly didn't give you nits."   Ridiculous.  
That's a really good question.  So across the filming procedure, we get the chance to spend time with them, with basic culinary lessons. So they won't know *exactly* what they're doing, but we'll show them basic techniques a few weeks prior. And also, things like the croquembouche - we'll do a class in sheet pastry, but we'll do sheet pastry BUNS, as opposed to actually doing a croquembouche.   When it comes to the more serious elimination challenges, they'll have insight 3-4 weeks out. We are halfway through shooting season 5 of Master Chef Junior, and I am staggered by the level of competition. We start taping tomorrow morning, but based on the standards of the first few seasons, the level is just amazing - they are coming in better, stronger. And for kids to have ballet lessons, soccer lessons, that's something we've grown up with. And I've never known kids like we're having now, who are having cooking lessons outside of school hours.  
Heh! Witty insults? Ehm... it just happens sort of spur-of-the-moment. I see red, I get frustrated, I let it go. I'm not very good at editing myself. I have to get things off my chest. If there's one thing my mum taught me, it's speak your mind, be firm, get things off your chest. I think it's a good way to work, and quite healthy to have that attitude. Do I think about it previously? No, they just come to me in a flashpoint. And sometimes even *I* sit back and think *Did I just say that?*  And then jellied eels - you've got to go to the East End of London, and get the most amazing Malt Vinegar. They're very healthy, packed with protein, and bloody delicious. And the River Thames now, in London, is TEEMING with eels - so some of the best eels in the world now are from London! They're delicious.  
That's a really good question.  I would recommend that you get adventurous with pulses - chickpeas, beans, lentils. And you know, cooking these is incredible. Brown rice? Phenomenal. You don't need expensive proteins. Just make them incredible with how you cook them, or prepare them - a pressure cooker is a great way of making these foods go a long way, is to cook them deliciously. Chilis, garlic, definitely.  
Good question! I got into running & doing triathlons - first of all, I've run over 15 marathons and doubles (ultra-marathons) in South Africa. So I needed a bigger sort of commitment, to spend a little bit more time to myself. So - listen - I love running, but it's given me quality time to spend on my own. SO I got into triathlons about 3 years ago, and it's helped me to stay even more focused in my day to day job.  
Well, first of all, you need help.  ***Spaghetti in a can!!?!*** That kind of shit we grew out of on our 8th birthday. I still remind my mum that she taught me how to spell with alphabetical spaghetti in a can.  You need help, big time.  My go-to sort of fast food snack... it would have to be In-N-Out Burger.  *Oh my god,* honestly, it is, when I eat Double-Doubles. I am *terrible.* And I always bring it back on the airport when I'm flying from LA to London, I'll sneak it into the first class lounge at BA! 
First of all, *The F Word* for me was a programme that taught me the importance of sources of food. The F Word tried to highlight the place of origin. How often do you go out for lunch or dinner, and you don't know where the food comes from? So the F Word tried to show the importance of that journey.  I've become a big fan of Vietnamese and Cambodian food. Because they cook with very little dairy. SO everything was tasty, but incredibly healthy at the same time. Great use of spice, broth, pork, a way of eating *well* but also JUST on the cusp of trying to stay healthy at the same time.   So, you know, when I travel across the US, I always try to get off the sort of main "foodie" - the main, sort of high streets, and get into little foodie quarters. If it's South New Orleans, or Austin Texas, I'm going for the latest little thing that's just opened. So I'm pretty low-key like that. I like going into some sort of off the beaten track areas.  
I have an amazing cocktail, which, you know, we're in Atlantic City currently, because we just launched the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill here, which is where we're calling from now.   It's with Tanqueray Gin, and it's called "Wake up you Donkey!" I mean, hahahahaha - it is incredible. And also, it's quite sort of spicy, and fragrant, and it's absolutely delicious.  
Wow, that's a great question.  Well, negative - the WORST meal? There's been too many of them to tell you about, because the last ten years, working on KITCHEN NIGHTMARES, I've eaten a lot of crap. I think I've drank about THREE and half litres of Pepto-Bismol! And in terms of, you know, good meals - I had an incredible meal at the Black Liquor Market in Studio City. The most amazing Scotch eggs, deviled eggs, and then these short ribs that were braised in beer.  *Incredible,* just incredible.  
Oh, gosh.  I don't really get a chance to sort of look at the internet. D'you know what? I love that level of connection, and I try to show as much as I can, who I'm with, where I am, and giving people inspiration, so I don't really think of myself as a phenomenon on the internet.  I'm a cook. Who happens to be the luckiest cook in the world.  
I would seriously nerd-gasm if this ever happened and was televised. We NEED A Ramsay-Bourdain show!!!! 
Loved it then and I love it now. I would have to say the "Hidden Mickey" at the Disney / MGM Studios. The actual park used to make a giant mickey mouse when seen from an airplane. Echo Lake (where Gertie's is) made his right ear and the place where that horrible hat was made up the nose. All of the expansions tore it all to shreds though. :( There are a LOT of attractions I miss terribly though. Horizons was such a peaceful ride (and cool as shit) and Journey into Imagination with the original figment had so many amazing tricks in it. I miss Delta Dream Flight and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride a lot too. 
For the most part I appreciated when parents would stay in character. I hated when people would tell their kids "It's just a guy in a suit, don't be scared", which scares the kids even more. What I didn't like was when they would drill me with trivia questions and make me act out the answers. That used to be fun in the old days but toward the end we had to see as many guests as possible and there was always pressure from management to go faster and faster. 
Oh my god I could go on for days about that. One thing that stands out was a special event where they needed 16 Mickeys all set out in various rooms and seeing all of them backstage was really weird.  
A guy once asked me to choke him for a picture (I didn't). That's a hard one because guests routinely do stupid weird things. I think the worst of them is when people bring their newborn infants to the parks and ask us to hold them for a picture. I can't see shit in Goofy let alone other costumes and I'm wearing giant gloves or paws or whatever depending on what character I am. Why would you let me hold your baby? Yeesh! 
I worked for Disney in merch at Magic Kingdom, do you remember where in MK he worked? I'm still part of some Facebook groups for Cast Members so I might be able to find him.  Either way, if you want him to get recognized, write a letter or email to Guest Relations. It'll help if you know around when you met him and where he worked (so they can find him easier) but it means a lot for a CM to receive a guest letter. We get to take the letter home and get a certificate and it's a really big deal that means a lot to CMs 
If you're talking about the "face" performers the answer is yes and no. Some of the break rooms are like the high school cafeteria where the "cool" princesses (elsa and anna) sit on one side and make eyes at the "old" characters (snow and poppins). It's really childish. Other face performers think they're on Broadway and demand respect and they hate not getting it. But those are extreme cases of a few bitches. For the most part the face performers are as much a character as any of us. Some of them are the sweetest people I've ever met in my life. 
Oh. My. God.  The first time some kid asked me to do the Perfect Cast I had no idea what he was talking about so I faked it. The kid didn't buy it but luckily I had an escort (that's what they called attendants back in the day) tell the kid that I already forgot it (which is bullshit if you watch the movie). They don't prepare you for details like that in training. You're just supposed to figure it out yourself. Never met Powerline unfortunately. 
We are NOT ALLOWED TO EVER TALK IN COSTUME IN FRONT OF GUESTS. EVER. Backstage however, anything goes. I used to love telling dirty jokes to unsuspecting new hires. I do have a good Goofy laugh but it took me years to perfect. 
I once saw an adult beat the absolute living shit out of a pre-teen boy on set as the Queen of Hearts. We're told never to interact when something like that happens so I had to leave. I've seen tons and tons of guests lose their shit in Guest Relations, particularly when it involved people not getting their way. I wish I had a camera sometimes. I would get so much delicious karma from /r/PublicFreakout 
Really?!? I remember feeling like I embarrassed you two! It's so nice to meet your adult self! 
It would depend on the situation. I've met my double on set by accident a few times over the years (it happens to the best of us) but it was just that, an accident. The only way someone would get fired (I'm only guessing here) is if they did it on purpose. 
Well, the worst I personally saw was in the 90's when Fantasyland Character Festival was still around which was the old queue for 20K Leagues Under the Sea. One of our greeters (that's what they called them then, they're attendants now) was a trans woman (that wasn't fooling anyone) and the police came and picked her up backstage. Evidently she was the father of a missing child and she was hiding out at Disney. Fucked up huh? There was also the infamous Michael Chartrand case who was the Tigger that felt up one of the guests. That was a really embarrassing blemish for Disney. It was on the front page of the Orlando Sentinel which is plopped down on everyone's doorstep at Disney (in the premium resorts anyway). He got his job back (there was a totally bizarre court case. His lawyer actually dressed up as Tigger to give the closing arguments) but he was fired a few years later for allegedly doing the same thing to one of the photographers. 
Playing peek-a-boo was my standard go-to with frightened children. It also helped if I pretended to be scared too then slowly took steps closer. The worst thing that happens is when parents try to force their kids on me or scold them for being scared. It always made the situation worse. 
I'm a mascot for a minor league baseball team. Sometimes I accidentally catch myself smiling underneath the costume.  
Wow, I have so many... I've answered some of this in the comments above but one thing that stands out was an emergency park dump one Forth of July in '95. There was a weird power glitch and all of the attractions went down at the same time and had to be evacuated. When they do the Fire Code estimates of how many people can be in the park at one time it is assumed that people will be in the rides. The Fourth of July is one of the park's busiest days of the year. Everyone dumped into the common areas of the park and it became dangerously crowded. One guest freaked out and pulled out something sharp and started stabbing guests to get out. I had to bring a stabbed guest back to her hotel to get her ID so she could go to the hospital. I'd never been so thankful to get off the desk in City Hall. That was a nightmare. 
They have to attempt to mimic the character's signature to the best of their ability. You sign so much though, it becomes second nature.   Wife was sleeping beauty for 3 years.  
I would go back in a heartbeat. Unfortunately this AMA would prevent that anyway. My therapist suggested it as a way to provide closure to the grieving process. Thank you for the kind words though. I appreciate it. 
It seems common sense, but go on "off times". Meaning late Feb/early march. Most people have already had their Winter break and it's before Spring Break season/school trip season. The parks are usually pretty slow (relatively). One of my favorite times of the day was the first gate opening of the day at MK. We called them the Stroller Races. It was fun watching all the moms speed walk their strollers as fast as they could to wherever they were going.  Also, I HIGHLY recommend taking part in, or at least watching the lowering of the flag at dusk/sunset. They'll usually allow a service member or EMS person to take part in and receive the flag they lowered. It's one of those simple events people usually just walk passed but is amazing to watch. Same goes for the fire show at the Polynesean at sunset time. 
Wasn't me but I'd like to shake the hand of the Goofy that helped you. That's a true magic moment. 
Hmmmm... One is the Automated Vacuum Assisted Collection System in the Magic Kingdom. There's a "tunnel" underneath (it's actually the first floor, the second and third floors are what you see in the park) and the AVACS is a series of tubes that connects all of the restaurants to the main dump that's behind Splash Mountain. The trash is whisked away under the park so the guests don't have to see it or smell it. It's pretty cool. 
I frowned once after opening a lanyard I'd bought and found to be frayed. Instantly a cast member appeared. It was creepy. 
My signature on my drivers license is Goofy's autograph. I signed it as a joke but the lady at the DMV told me my signature could be anything I wanted. I've signed Goofy by accident a few times. I did a lot of tigger too and would sometimes forget who I was and sign Goofy anyway. 
I'm not sure if I can ever go back. Right now I'm just doing odd jobs to survive and I'm getting help from my family. The problem is finding my passion. I never intended to leave Disney and that was my passion. I think I'd like to go into a field where I'm able to help people, perhaps with troubled teens or people with addiction problems. I have zero experience though so not many doors are open to me at the moment but I'm working on ways to fix that. :)  
We used to be able to sign our character's autograph any way we wanted (except Mickey) but then a guy named Chris came up with standard autographs which are consistently used no matter who the performer is, which is way better in my opinion. We have a small summary of the character that has the autograph on it and we try to make it look the same when we sign. Goofy is easy to do but I can write it upside down which would totally freak the guests out. :) That took a while to learn. I can also sign it behind my head and with my eyes closed. 
I once misjudged a step and ended up in the mud up to my knees at a park once (it was a special cast member event so I got away with it). I've tripped countless times and was always able to make it part of the act so to speak. I almost cut off a guest's toes once (I was Baloo and she was wearing open sandals) which was disgusting because of the blood. I also fell down the stairs on the castle stage as the Queen of Hearts once. Not my proudest moment. 
What it feels like to put a genuine smile on someone's face while dressed up as a character. 
Not OP but lived in Orlando and can answer the second one. They're technically not ever allowed to say that they ARE the character, they're supposed to tell people theyr'e "friends with" the character. A college friend of mine was "friends with" Belle. But most people who live around here know someone at Disney and so we all know what the code means.  
When my daughter was 4 she made Pluto cry. We were at the Disney Hotel in DL. Pluto ran over to me and my kids. My eldest daughter wasn't ever afraid of the characters but my 4 year old never wanted anything to do with them. (Wouldn't even sit on Santa's lap at Christmas time) Pluto ran over and waved at us but my 4 year old ran away from him. He chased after her a few steps in a way to plead with her but when he wasn't able to win her over he ran over to a bench and laid down and sobbed. My heartless toddler didn't give a shit if she made that dog cry.  
Honestly, it was my most exciting moment at work. I still can't believe they let me do that.  
I had two stalkers for about 8 months. They were two British guests that were here for a long time. They would come watch my first two sets (started when I was Captain Hook but mostly when I was the Queen of Hearts) then they would go to the Animal Kingdom and watch Lion King and then head back to the Magic Kingdom to see my last two sets. They did this every day. An attendant slipped up and told them my name (she assumed I knew them) so no matter what costume I was in they'd find out. I had SO MUCH FUN with these two girls. It got a bit creepy towards the end and they started writing me notes that were weird. Eventually security talked to them and they left me alone. I actually kind of miss them, they were a lot of fun. 
Honestly, it depends. We have some people that dream of working at Disney their entire lives. Some of them freak out when they find out how it all works and they get bitter. Others come in bitter and Disney gets them and they're full of the dust (the Pixie kind). Personally, I was gung-ho at first then calmed down a bit but then exploded again. I loved working there. Well, I loved being on stage with guests. Backstage, the managers are always on your ass, which used to be different. Sad really, but that's the way it went. 
I got lost at typhoon lagoon. I played checkers with some dude for like 30 minutes until my family found me. 
Wear comfortable shoes. Book your restaurants in advance. Try not to bring your busy life with you. Enjoy the scenery while you're waiting in the queues. It's a good opportunity to people watch. Don't expect to do half of what you want to do. Prioritize and get the most important stuff out of the way **on the first day**. Don't wait. And know that part of the fun of Disney is discovering things as you go. Ask your fellow guests in line what they think is cool. You'll make some friends and uncover more about the park than I could ever tell you! :) Have fun and say hi to Goofy for me okay? 
No because the shorter my fights are, the more fights I can have. I only have a finite amount of fight time, and I'd like to fight as long as possible.  
1. winning my Olympic medal 2. doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. If a guy is lame, he'll have to come up with activities to distract you from his lameness. If he's all kinds of awesome, doing nothing with him with be all kinds of awesome. 
Yes. Very soon. It's just my life is crazy sauce, so it's hard to do just fun stuff. Apart from reddit :) 
well... a lot of the good ones have been taken, but I'd like to vie for Miss Marvel.  
I accept that I have NO control over my image already. So, I try not to let the state of my perception have any effect on my happiness. You can never truly know anyone through only media anyway. If anything I just try to keep in mind that I'm an entertainer and not a politician or Miss America. 
Buffalo Bill. Him destroying the buffalo population of America also destroyed the Native American culture and coming from Jamestown ND, which boasts having the largest statue of a buffalo in the world, the plight of the buffalo is quite near and dear to my heart. 
i always get super stoked when I see it's a Daenarys (the ANTI D.N.B.) chapter, and would get really bummed when I saw it was a Catlyn chapter. But for some reason my heart is always Team Stark.   My sigil would be a Mew with Vegeta hair. 
At least 60 in one sitting. But there were no bets on the table. I think I could've done more if it really came down to it. 
Having the same conversation over and over reminds me of bar-tending, and I'm thankful for the training I received having to deal with stupid questions from repetitive drunks. I only do it because I know I'll receive tips at the end ;) 
Only in post.  The advice: for any woman trying to break into a male-dominated career, I'd say the greatest thing you can do is always keep in mind that you always have the right to be there. 
I know I'm not rowdy. but, you do the sports and activities for YOU. Don't let them bother you. In 10 years you're still going to be buff and fit, and all them will be wishing they were you, or with you.  
Definitely. I loved being in Wrestlemania and will find a way to get back in the squared circle I just have no clue when. And any real wrestling fan would want to be surprised anyway. 
1 Mew sized Mewtwo, 'cuz everyone knows that even though Mewtwo has better stats than Mew, 100 Mews totally overcome that. 
Ooooooh. Since I've been playing from the beginning I have a certain affinity for the psychic type. But that being said, fairies seem pretty badass these days but I gotta go with the original 151 types and psychic was my fave because Mew is my jam.  
Sounds tempting.... but I prefer a man to have the balls to ask me through a medium other than the Internet. Good try though- you sound like a catch. ;) 
If you want to get to orbit or beyond, go with pure rockets. It is not like Von Braun and Korolev didn't know about airplanes and they were really smart dudes. 
Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom.  We are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure. 
At first, I was thinking we would just scale up Falcon Heavy, but it looks like it probably makes more sense just to have a single monster boost stage. 
I pretty much made that up. I have no idea :)  The grid fins are super important for landing with precision. The aerodynamic forces are way too strong for the nitrogen thrusters. In particular, achieving pitch trim is hopeless. Our atmosphere is like molasses at Mach 4! 
There is a great quote by Churchill: "If you're going through hell, keep going." 
I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be.  Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying.  One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.   
Yes, but probably only a few hours  Party at Cocoa Beach!  
This question probably breaks certain agreements sadly 
Goal is 100 metric tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars. This obviously requires a very big spaceship and booster system. 
Default plan is to have a sea level and vacuum version of Raptor, much like Merlin. Since the booster and spaceship will both have multiple engines, we don't have to have fundamentally different designs.   This plan might change. 
SR-71  Hard to pick a favorite. I tend to like FPS with a story, like Bioshock, Fallout or Mass Effect, but was also a big fan of Civ and Warcraft.  French and BBQ  Whiskey     
As interesting as the space-related stuff is, this is exactly the topic I'd like to know more about.  The concerns were pretty serious, so, yes -- what galvanised them, I wonder... 
Yes, he has talked about electric, supersonic, vertical take off and landing jets. He thinks that once batteries reach an energy density of 400 wh/kg, it will be feasible to have a range of 2000-3000 miles.  He's also talked about making pre-fabricated freeway sections to speed up construction on the 405. (he has to sit through the traffic there almost every day). 
What is this? Is there no concept of Boot Salesman-Client Confidentiality? 
He actually invented time travel in the future, and realized by looking at ancient records of "The Great Modernizer" of the 21st century that this figure was, actually, himself. He knew from that point on that he had to return to push humanity forward.  This would be make a great writing prompt.  
I'm a software engineer from Detroit.  I'm currently working in Silicon Valley but moving back to Detroit next month.  I would leave my job in a heartbeat if Tesla opened up a location in Southeastern Michigan! 
Not the dude, but...it depends. Sometimes a court will issue a temporary injunction preventing the change while the case is litigated. Sometimes nothing happens, but also just because Trump issues an order doesn't mean that suddenly all the rules change. You can open up the arctic for drilling (for example) but until a company submits a plan and obtains a permit for exploration (which takes awhile) nothing happens. And the court may order the permit review to be put on hold. If they win, the court wold order the executive branch office responsible for issuing those permits...to not issue any permits. No permit, no exploration or drilling. Things like that happen.   
Might I add that if it could be in layman terms, that would be great. 
They all leak eventually, this one isn't worse. More to the point of the protests and resistance, it was planned to go through sovereign Indigenous territory, and when they declined they were met with force. US law does not give them the right to do this, it is illegal. 
I think in a previous post on the topic it was pointed out that moving the same oil by rail is probably far more dangerous for the environment.  Wish I could find the reference. 
Thank you for asking the questions I wanted to, but in a much smarter way.    Of course, there's no way he will touch this question with a ten foot pole.  
There's a general, low-level understanding that nobody will actually be allowed to drill the arctic in a big way. It's yet to be written in agreement, but shitty moves like the US taking a slice means everyone else will want to go for it.  The best result (and maybe only, if we want a liveable Earth), is to steadfastly push for no more drilling of any kind for oil in the Arctic. Not try win the rat race to oblivion. 
I'm a layman and not even American so my knowledge of this is weak at best, but my guess is that there will likely be more to gained from the potential attention to the issues lawsuits like this might bring rather than the results of the judgment. 
Kinda strange to hold a Job and hate what the missions of the job are. But here we are. 
Safer doesn't necessarily mean good. The real question is whether we should rely on oil as a main source of energy. It is bad for the environment when it burns because it releases release green houses gases. It's bad in production because product destroys land/ pollutes land. It's inevitably bad because the pipelines and all forms of transportation for it eventually leak/ malfunction. If we have the ability to develop better sources of energy, why shouldn't we do that instead? It just seems more ethical, you know? Less pollution means better environmental health and thus better human healthy, considering the fact that we live in the environment.  
Congratulations on graduating! Thank you for pursuing such a great cause. Best of luck  
Good point but Trump will most likely not show up in these cases in court. The DoJ will represent him in court. EarthJustice has won cases against the DoJ before--it'll happen again. No, they won't win all of these lawsuits, but they will win some of them. 
The organization has filed numerous suits against the Obama administration, so since then at least it seems 
They are never answering this question, this guy wants media attention and donations. 
Do you want to get a REEE? Cause that's how you get a REEE. 
Quite a few yes. Many of which are just insulting the OP. Pro-Trump people seem to be upset because they can't defend the fact that he is actively harming the environment with his actions and orders. 
You can sign up as a campaign manager for summer internships, you make awesome friends, get paid, and it's for a good cause  I actually got into politics for a bit because of that, and realized both parties are absolute shit holes 
54.1k yet the top upvoted question only has 1400 votes. Then it quickly drops from there. That's pretty shady. 
In another comment he said they did sue Obama for a ton of stuff.  
Wasting taxpayer money on frivolous lawsuits AND killing economy by increasing dependence on foreign oil (and everyone blamed Bush for made up ulterior motives for the war in the middle east), AND killing American jobs. 
More damage from protests than pipeline? How do you know if it's not done? I'm happy for the polar bears. When the earth heats up more water evaporates in the atmosphere, increasing snowfall in areas. Antarctica saw a high three years ago? It's gone.  Both Arctic and Antarctica ice are on a downward trend. Speculation and half truths  
What could they do, send the Pinkerton's after  them? 
Because the environment isn't broad enough for you? It kind of affects everyone, everywhere. 
That's something interesting that I would like to know as well. But, I suspect the answer is no unless you believe that the free market will find it in its best interest to protect the environment...and I don't particularly think that it will, not yet anyway. 
From what I've gathered in OP's responses, it's legal for the President to designate these areas but not legal to reverse this designation because that power resides with Congress.  
The stability of the system is still unclear, because it is a complex dynamical system, the planets' masses are not yet precisely determined, we don't know yet the orbital period of the 7th planet, and there could be more planets. More on this soon! 
TRAPPIST-1 shows one flare (eruption) every week and a strong one every 6 months. Its X ray activity is not yet very well known and could be also a thread for any life there. But if the planets have an atmosphere and magnetic field this could limit the level of high energy flux. This is still work under investigation to estimate those levels. 
to bounce off this: will SETI start listening to this system, now?  
We do not yet have a protocol. Most likely we will make a tentative discovery, that will take longer to confirm. SS 
It's going to be awhile before we find an oxygen rich atmosphere. JWST launch in fall 2018, so we will have to wait to try until sometime after that. It turns out some oxygen-rich atmospheres might exist that are not created by life, so to associate oxygen will require care. I hope we will be able to find, identify, and announce in a few years! --SS 
We will look at the atmosphere for gases that do not belong--gases that might be attributed to life. We will not know if the gases are produced by microbial life or by intelligent alien species. --SS 
Answer to first question:  Determining the surface gravity requires knowledge of both the radius and mass.  The uncertainties on the mass measurements are large, but our best guess is that the surface gravity of most of these planets is similar to that on Earth.  One exception is planet f.  It has the same radius as Earth but 68% the mass.  That means the surface gravity will be 68% that of Earth. - Natalie Batalha   
All of them.  They are very, very close together  All are much closer to one another and to their host star than the Mars-Earth distance, for example. Michael Werner 
Tidal-locking: we think as long as there is an atmosphere (even a thin atmosphere like that on Mars) heat will circulate around the planet. So habitability location should extend beyond the limbs. 
Surface temperatures depend on the proximity to the central star but also on the composition and thickness of the planet's atmosphere.  Since we do not yet know anything about the planetary atmosphere's, all we can say is how much energy a planet is receiving from the star compared to how much energy Earth receives from the Sun.  However, because this planetary system is so nearby, scientists should be able to characterize the atmospheres with future instruments and observatories.  That's one reason why we're so excited about this discovery.  - Natalie Batalha 
Not only that, but possibly even  magnetic, geological/volcanic, and other unforeseen effects too. 
That would be a lovely idea.. With the TRAPPIST team, we were more considering using names of the few trappist beers ;) !  J.d.W. 
NASA's upcoming James Webb Telescope, launching in 2018, will take over with a much higher sensitivity. It will be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of water, methane, oxygen, ozone, and other components of a planet's atmosphere. Farisa Morales 
The habitable zone is estimated based on the luminosity of the star and recognizing how far away can you be from it such that water can exist in it's liquid form on the surface of a terrestrial planet like the earth.  Too close and the water evaporates; too far and the water freezes solid.  Thus, the habitable zone is independent of whether the planets are tidally locked or not.  Farisa Morales 
You're correct! Using the transit technique, we can only find the planets passing in front of their star from our perspective. And as not all planets are on aligned plans, not all planets can be detected with this technique. Fortunately, other techniques exist to help us detect non-transiting planets (e.g., radial-velocity, direct-imaging, and astrometry techniques, among others). J.d.W. 
There are many possibilities.  You can log into the NASA Planet Quest site and see tools and data bases about the planets as they are discovered.  Try logging into "Eyes on Exoplanets".  JPL, Goddard, and other NASA centers have summer internships and lots going on in the world of exoplanets; this would be a good way for you to get some firsthand experience.  Most NASA scientists like myself have PhDs but have chosen to work for NASA rather than in universities.  You could start in a PhD program...possibly doing your research in direct conjunction with NASA, or working for a professor like Sara Seager who does lots of NASA-funded work on exoplanets.  Following that, try for a postdoctoral position at a NASA center; many good postdocs go on to become regular NASA employees.  I appreciate your interest! Michael Werner 
The 3 planets e, f and g are the so called habitable zone and are the best candidates to harbor liquid water and... maybe... life !  
 Observations such as those described today require precision much higher than 1%.  At this level, we discovered in the initial data on exoplanets various "systematic effects" having to do with both the telescope and the instrument which made it difficult to achieve this level of performance.  So the re-engineering really meant using the telescope and analyzing the data in new and different ways; this continues as we strive to achieve higher and higher precision. - M. Werner see spitzer.caltech.edu for more information. 
JWST will be able to look at the atmospheres of these planets all the way out to the infrared looking for the carbon and oxygen-based species. This will give us better information about how thick the atmosphere is and what it is made up of, I.e. If it is condensed 100% water or carbon dioxide or something different. -NL 
"a" is for the star main star. We start naming companions with "b" if it is a planet, with "B" if it is another star. J.d.W. 
Very true! We have a very Earth-centric perspective on Life and habitability. But this is the beauty of exoplanetary science. We are exploring other worlds, finding unexpected planet types (e.g., hot-Jupiter, super-Earths), planets around completely different types of stars. All this is helping us broadening our perspective on planetary systems, which was based on a century-long study of our own system. Now, let's hope exoplanetary science will provide us with a similar perspective shift on habitability and Life--in the Universe! J.d.W. 
Yes, red dwarfs (also called M dwarfs to astronomers) have a number of complications as host stars. M dwarfs flare frequently and can emit a lot of high energy radiation that can batter their planets' atmospheres. On top of that, when M dwarfs are young, they are much, much brighter during a period called the pre-main sequence. What this means is that planets currently in the habitable zone of M dwarfs were actually interior to the habitable zone during the long pre-main sequence phase and could now be desiccated and potentially Venus-like despite being in the habitable zone today. One way of getting around this challenge is if the planets migrated into the habitable zone from farther out after the super luminous pre-main sequence phase ended -- which is possible! And yes, there is a good chance these planets are tidally locked, although this does not necessarily rule out habitability. -G.A. 
The discovery was made with the so called "transit technique" : you stare many stars and wait a little dip of the light due to a planet passing in front of it ! The discovery was made using various telescopes using that technique, first the Liege University small TRAPPIST robotic telescope but many other like the VLT, UKIRT in Hawaii and more recently the NASA IR Spitzer  space telescope that was looking at TRAPPIST-1 for 20 days continuously to unravel a total of 7 earth sized planets ! There are other techniques but this one is beautiful because it gives lot of informations like the size of the planet and even the mass in this case thanks to the variation of the transit timings due to the interaction between the planets themselves 
Yes quite a few of us are. From the NASA HQ library, write a few people went for a big "YES!" to your question ;) J.d.W. 
The first observations of the newly discovered planets are underway, as soon as the results successfully pass through the scientific peer review process we will be able to share what we are learning. Stay tuned this system has lots more exciting things to teach us. - HW 
The tidal interactions between the planets should be far from being strong enough to significantly raise their temperatures.  
We are currently making observations of some of these new planets, what is important is that these results go through the proper scientific process, I.e. Detailed and backed up analysis, and then peer review for publication. As soon as that happens the results will be available for the public. Stay tuned there is a lot we will be learning from TRAPPIST-1 for years to come - HW 
Kepler can observe for about 80 days consecutively and will therefore provide a very important time series and information on the gravitational interactions between the plaets which cause timing variations.  It is possible that there may be additional planets not seen by Spitzer in 20 days which Kepler could uncover.  Kepler and Spitzer have comparable capabilities for the detection of planets around the TRAPPIST-1 system.  The Trappist planets are certainly among the first "cold Earths' to be candidates for further observations, and 1h in particularly will be the coldest.  Michael werner 
Venus and Mars are on the edges ! none of them are habitable and what a difference with planet Earth. Mars is too small and has not magnitic field so it lost its atmosphere and now it is too cold to keep liquid water on the surface. And Venus has such a thick atmosphere that there is a strong greenhouse effect and it is far too warm to keep running water. So the key is also the atmospheres of the planets... next step is to find them around T1 planets !  
Our exoplanet search targets the 50 nearest Southern ultracool dwarf stars. TRAPPIST-1 was among them.  M. Gillon 
TRAPPIST-1 is a an ultracool dwarf star, the longest-lived stars of the Universe. It's lifetime should be much larger than 100 billions years.  M. Gillon 
Oh, Reddit. Considering the syntax of this classic question, I'd personally go with one Earth over a hundred. ;-) -- Stephanie 
The fact that the planets are really tightly packed is at the basis of lots of exciting thoughts. First, this allow for material transfer way either than in our planetary system. This means that rocks, and anything on/around them, could be sent/transfer easily from one planet to the next. So if a few of these planets were habitable, we can theorize about the idea of a microbial biomass colonizing different planets, then evolving independently.. Another brilliant thing to theorize about is "how would civilizations evolving with large bodies with way more structures than our Moon crossing their sky would be affected by these bodies, by Space?"..  Possibilities are endless!  J.d.W. 
We'd want to search for signs of water vapor in their atmospheres since water is a necessary part of planetary habitability. We'd also want to search for gases that can be produced by life (e.g. oxygen, methane), although with the caveat that that we'll have to consider these gases in the context of the larger planetary environment to determine whether they're actually from life or are instead life "false positives" -- gases that LOOK like they're from life but actually from abiotic processes. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can take the first steps towards characterizing these planets. It will be a challenge, but we like challenges! -G.A. 
The Spitzer telescope points at the Trappist star.  The light from the star is imaged on to what is called an infrared array, a specialized and expensive version of your cell phone camera which works in the infrared.  The electronic signals from the camera, which contain the information about the brightness of the star, are stored on Spitzer and sent back to Earth, where they are analyzed electronically to determine the brightness.  This was done every two seconds for twenty days; the accumulated data was sent back every three days or so.  Michael Werner 
In the Q&A section after the main part of the announcement, somebody asked the same question. The answer was that yes, SETI has been listening to the system, and no, they have not heard anything from it. 
We don't know whether they are going clockwise or counterclockwise around the star.  However, we are quite sure they must all be going around in the same direction, as do the planets in our solar system; otherwise it would be quite unstable.  Michael Werner  
I think we can put an end to CISA for good. We just need to kill it so bad that it becomes toxic and no one in Congress wants to go anywhere near it ever again. That's what happened to SOPA, so we know it's possible. The companies behind this would no doubt continue to try to sneak it through in some other form, but making Congress afraid to touch CISA or similar bills would be a huge step in the right direction. 
1) Because the best way to kill a company is to push politics at people who aren't there for politics, and 2) Twitter is not a person, it's a corporation, filled with shareholders with different opinions. It's one thing to have an official stance on something, it's another thing to start using resources to push a political point of view.  Everyone hates when corporations use their muscle to push political views -- except evidently when they push something someone agrees with. 
It seems like we need something like that, though it would be quite the sea change. Right now, they keep bringing back failed legislation and in the last 24 hours of this fight, we really can't risk not signing petitions, calling, tweeting and sharing online like here on reddit (which turns out matter a lot) to make sure we kill this bill first. But, that's why we do need to change the way politics is done and not just money in politics, but open up the political process in millions of ways, including by demanding public accountability every step of the way using online and other means, and building a new kind of political movement that is resilient to the Chamber and other big industry doing this kind of thing, and passing possibly something like you suggest. 
Why blame reddit? The rest of the media has given it even less coverage.  It's almost like they *all benefit from having every citizen constantly surveilled.*

Yes, it will affect Canadians and everyone else, in some ways worse. The law encourages the capture of data, regardless of whether its from the U.S. or elsewhere. Lots of it will flow to U.S. companies, or through the U.S..  Since you're not a U.S. person (we need a better term for that, if anyone has ideas) the U.S. government already cares less. There are a few weak protections for data from the U.S., and a few more will be written, but those won't apply. 
Because each time its going to get closer.  We are going to get tired of emailing eventually.  Read the comments, people are already tired of it.  Multiple comments complain about the amount of emails and how they ignore them or unsubscribed.  At some point, probably now, it will pass because Congress is both bought and not technologically savvy to really understand what this bill means/doesn't care.   
Note that bills like Marijuana legalization and gay marriage would suffer from this as well.  
Ask him if, in his opinion, proposed "cybersecurity" legislation like CISA would have had any chance of prevent the major security incidents that we've seen over the past few years - the Target, Sony, OPM breaches for example. I believe you'll find his answer enlightening (spoiler: it wouldn't have done anything!) 
This is a great question. We have to be vigilant. We need to look for these policies from the very beginning and start to speak out as soon as they are being discussed. Let's all work together to weigh in early and often. 
What happens next is the bill will go to a conference committee with the house and reconcile CISA with the house's bills which are PCNA and NCPAA. This is not a process that can be stopped but others can influence by getting people on the committee. All three bills are similar but go about it in different ways like which agency will get the data, how much a role DHS plays, etc and all three will be combined into one bill which then must pass the house and senate one more time so there's still time. Burr, one of CISA's sponsors says that this will take some time and go at a slow pace and it's unlikely the house and senate will reconcile the differences before the new year.  You can shame your senators by calling the up and telling them you are extremely disappointed in their vote.    
Imagine how much worse it'll get for you if the bill passes 
It is the last chance in the sense that the Senate will be voting on the bill tomorrow. The House has already approved its own versions and then it'll go through conference process on its way for signature by the President. This is the last chance in that if we don't stop it now it will become law. 
It may not seem like it, but we win a lot. We won on SOPA/PIPA, we won on Net Neutrality, not everyone like USA FREEDOM Act but it was the first time the government attempted to limit surveillance in a generation. This bill is the most hydra of them all, but even this bill we've beaten over and over again. The motivation is that we can actually be effective. 
CISA specifically exempts itself from FOIA, so it will be impossible to know what's being shared and what personal information is included. That will make it much more difficult to challenge through the courts.  
The Senate voted on a procedural vote to advance the bill (called a Cloture vote). It will then have more votes on amendments to the bill, and a final vote on the actual bill.  
Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein have been leading the effort in support of the bill. 
How about something like this?:   "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." 
The EFF has lawyers and everything on their payroll and has taken up fights in courts together with other similar organization.  I wouldn't say your money is badly spent by using them on the EFF. 
I've used reddit for several years now and I don't really notice it. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, but that it's fairly non-obtrusive at least to me - a casual. For example, taking "offensive" content off the front page -- I don't really notice that it's gone in my day-to-day scrolling. The speed at which the front page refreshed has been more noticeable to me.   
Probably something along the lines of they publicly oppose it but are paying lobbying groups to go lobby against it for them. 
What repercussions?  This won't hurt Congress.  This is how the system works.  Please, work to change the system, but in the mean time, make a call to your senator.  It's simple and easy.  This stuff matters.   
Lately I've been seriously craving rice cakes. They're easy to eat like popcorn, but they're healthier and the seeds don't get stuck in my teeth. For an average user, you may not notice immediately.  But a few things. 1) Your information may be transferred to law enforcement which could search it without a warrant. (Meaning if they were suspicious of you, they could check what they have on you in the company store. Or if they wanted to compel you to testify or agree to a plea bargain.) 2) You're not going to be able to trust the companies you rely on. Even if they signed a contract in blood, CISA would give them immunity to violate it. So you'll probably be forced to change your habits. And 3) when you know you're being watched, people change their behavior and that's the antithesis of freedom.  
I have a recurring dream that I am back working on Burnout 3. Normally that I'm playing the game, and we've made it so every race ends with a crash junction. Then I wake up in a cold sweat. Games dev does things to you. 
Sony has been super cool to work with, but mainly just because they haven't been involved in development, you know? We're still sort of the underdog with Sony, and in the general AAA (for obvious reasons). If NMS is a success, I think that probably will have a real impact in terms of how a lot of people in larger publishers view indie games. People generally think of NMS as a Sony title, but we're still just a self funded indie studio - it's kind of a crazy situation :) 
Some of the team read it for sure, and then post me the weirdest stuff :) OK sso I'll admit there have been times, my lowest on the project, where I've looked at the subreddit and it's cheered me up and kept me going. But there have been times I've looked on there and despaired - and just thought "how can we ever live up to the expectations of people who having been waiting for this game for 3 years" 
Yeah, so everyone thinks we were high or drunk :( Just hadn't eaten today, and am operating on zero sleep.  It's an ok buzz. 5/10. Would not sleep again. 
Oh man, I hate questions like this, because like wouldn't you just rather discover for yourself? Huge creatures are out there, and I haven't seen them on streams yet. They are rare. 
What the hell is going on here? This is one of the fastest rising posts I've ever seen.  
It could be for sure. We were talking today about just having a twitter bot that tweets discovery names at random. We've just been glued to the screen all day, watching names come in. Game isn't out... but we had like 160k discoveries uploaded today... so... :o 
So Elon Musk asked me this (NAME DROP!). I said if I was Elon Musk, then I'd be pretty sure it was right? Like load up the holodeck with the disk where I get to colonise mars and make self driving cars... So I think he almost certainly is, and then I'm an AI bot I guess? In his simulation? Controlled by a giant AI that's smirking to itself whilst I give this answer.... 
This excites me. I want to build a zoo. Why build a base if you cant shove it full of insane creatures :| 
Didn't he release a trailer for the game and then after the flood he said he would have cancelled the game if the trailer wasn't out? 
Initially I think we'll all be supporting NMS. But there are other ideas we've got rattling around in our heads too. I think video games is just such a largely unexplored field. There's very few studios that pull off the two game thing, but supporting one game and then kicking off something new - that's doable right?  Sh*t, I just remembered, we've got another thing we're already working on that's unannounced. It's a small experiment, but hopefully you all might like it :)  Maybe we can be the Johnny Depp of studios :D - do a mixture of big stuff and indie stuff? :D 
I know you're trying to prove a point and everything, but I would love being the best con artist of the 21st Century tbh. 
I'm in the UK and came here to say the same thing to Sean. I decide every 2 months what game to buy because money is tight so i have to prioritise. Not so long ago I made the stupid decision of believing Sean's bullshit. I hope you can't sleep at night you dirty lying thief. I bought digital so I can't even trade in for pennies. Fuck you HG 
"And this my grand child, was the planet I spawned on the day the game came out 62 year ag... Super nova destroyed it...fuck" 
Hope so, but you would probably be forced to play offline if that was the case. 
He made more then $45m I don't think he considers it bombed 
You burned your digital download? Did you... did you burn your computer? Because I think Sean may have beat you again. 
If not full multi-player, are you at least considering ways for you to "find your friends" in-game? 
you mean disappointed that they spent $60 or more on a shitty game that was sold to them on lies? 
He has stated on previous interviews that there would not be gas giants.  
I can help you with that first one. :)  Stop copy-pasting from google. Whenever I'd google code I would handwrite it all and make sure I understood at *least* the general idea of what I was writing, if not exactly how it worked. Never copy paste.  
This is the question I want answered the most.  I'm pretty sure they've said it was TECHNICALLY possible in the past, just that it's next to impossible due to the size of the universe in the game, but the way they keep saying things now leads me to believe that it's just absolutely not possible and the functionality isn't in the game at all. 
Wait, wait. You sent them cupcakes in June, I assume near the time they announced the delay and got flooded with death threats? 
Oh we hang out all the time. He comes by The Planetary Society; we talk about the cosmos and our place in space. 
Not my choice. Please ask the Disneynians to refresh the ride. It was a fun job. It was sponsored by Exxon, while they still owned a division that made bearings for wind turbine generators, and before their climate denial documents from 1977 were discovered and published in the New York Times. I'd love to do a new show though. 
You and I are made of the same material as the stars. We are star dust. Therefore, you and I are at least one way that the universe knows itself. Cue the spooky music. 
He and is companies are shaking things up in a great way. Some disclosure, he served on the Board of The Planetary Society for a while, but has had to recuse himself as SpaceX became Yuge. (I gave him a ride to the airport once.) The Tesla outperforms conventional gas-powered cars (as does my new all-electric Chevy Bolt). If the reused lower stage of the Falcon rockets proves profitable, it will change space exploration in great way. Go Elon! (He's an immigrant to the U.S., bt-dubs.) 
Dang it Bill, it's only been an hour, I wish this one could've been answered. 
Self-driving vehicles seem to me to be the next Big Thing. Think of all the drivers, who will be able to do something more challenging and productive with their work day. They could be erecting wind turbines, installing photovoltaic panels, and running distributed grid power lines. Woo hoo! 
The quality of life for people everywhere will go down. There will be less food and less clean water available in the developed and the developing world. It's reasonable that this will lead to conflict: more violence, more war. Here in the super-developed US, people will have to abandon homes in Miami, Galveston, Norfolk, and other coastal towns. It will lead to defaulted mortgages and people looking for jobs inland. Where will those jobs come from? Sooner we get to work the better. 
Infinitesimal. If you think you want to live on Mars, try living in the dry valleys of Antarctica for a few years. And to play fair, you have to bring your own air to breathe. Inhaling the local atmosphere on Mars would kill you in an instant. You'd never go outside, not really. You'd live in some dome, and when you go out, you have to be in a spacesuit, which is just another dome, only really tight fitting. Oh, and there is absolutely nothing to eat. 
Nope. When you get your job as a dancer on broadway, don't ever tell people who your favorite dance partner is. Otherwise, you won't get a chance to dance with anyone else. There is something in every episode that I just love. The spit take in Ocean Life cracks me up as does the screaming skull I'm holding in Bones & Muscles. And, who doesn't love passing out in a fighter plane pulling 7.5 g's? 
Thanks for your support. I don't have a favorite (favourite). Saturn is beautiful. And, I am fond of the Earth's Moon. 
People seem to afraid of politicizing science a lot lately. I agree to an extent - science should not be a political issue as it is really just our best gauge of reality.   However, in recent decades, science has been under attack and forced into being a political issue. It is not our choice whether or not this happens, it's happened already.  Our best course of action is to defend science since it is constantly under attack by ignorance, closed-mindedness, and bull-headed paranoia. It's very important that we defend science. 
Plant-based diets are the future. I look forward to food preparations that are not "derivative bits," as we say in comedy writing. Instead of "coconut bacon," for example, I hope there is just delicious stand-alone coconut preparations. Cooking is a competitive business. I look forward to the emergence of new plant-based dishes. 
Check out Nick Graham. com. Consider buying our ties! 
I hope people coming of age have a respect for the process of science in part because of my show(s). If not, I guess I've failed, but I did and continue to do my best. Checkout Bill Nye Saves The World, which starts on Friday on Netflix. There are 13 episodes. Binge 'em, and turn it up loud! 
Favorite element? Don't have one, but I am fond of the compound water. In fact, now that I've sipped it, I don't think I could live without it. Subatomic particle? Not sure, but I'd sure like to know if there are particles associated with dark matter. Darkons? 
Be sure you can do algebra. It is a key to success in a technical field. I work in a writers room these days. If you want to do what I do now, look for a job as a television writer. Thanks for being a member of The Planetary Society. We advance space science and exploration. Let's know the cosmos and our place within it! 
Pick up trash. Especially around water sources. Although to be honest I'm not sure if that'll help climate change. But it'll help something :) 
I can't, no one can, prove there is no higher power. It's the age-old philosophical point that one cannot prove a negative. Whether or not there is a higher power, there is no question that the Earth cannot possibly 6,000 years old. Teaching kids that idea is bad for our future. But worse, is teaching kids that the Earth is cooling rather than warming. All this is made possible in Kentucky by their having elected a creationist governor, who appointed a creationist cabinet, which was in turn enabled by a creationist judge. In any other state or commonwealth, the non profit businesses run by Mr. Ham would be in  conflict with out First Amendment. it will take years to undo the wrong-headed teaching of the kids in the Commonwealth. But the longest journey begins with but a single step. Thanks for writing. If you are really in touch with a Higher Power, ask her or him to straighten these Kentuckians (and immigrant Australian) out. 
For us on the outside, it has always been a bit of mystery that Scotland has separate teams from Britain. Carry on. 
As someone that has met Bill in real life, I thought he was a nice dude.  At the same time, you have to remember that:  * "Bill Nye the Science Guy" is a character he performs for an audience.  That's not who he is 24/7.  * He's an intelligent guy that deals with a lot of memeish behavior from his adoring fans, which must get tiresome.  * I could be mistaken on this one, but I think he cares MUCH more about pushing his agendas forward than he does about maintaining his celebrity status.  If he could magically trade in his celebrity for progress on reversing the changes of global warming, I think he'd do it in a heartbeat.  Normal actors are the other way around- they put up with your bullshit so they can still be famous. 
Vaccines make the top of the list. Being able to grow up healthy is the most basic thing. So many kids get infectious diseases and don't develop mentally and physically. I was in Berlin yesterday helping raise $7.5B for vaccines for kids in poor countries. We barely made it but we did which is so exciting to me! 
Lol, this has already been written into a stupidly short article on ABC News, linked on the front page of Google News in Technology. "Bill Gates Reveals What Makes Him Feel 'Pretty Stupid' " 
There will be more progress in the next 30 years than ever. Even in the next 10 problems like vision and speech understanding and translation will be very good. Mechanical robot tasks like picking fruit or moving a hospital patient will be solved. Once computers/robots get to a level of capability where seeing and moving is easy for them then they will be used very extensively.  One project I am working on with Microsoft is the Personal Agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to. The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this. It will work across all your devices. 
I am pretty basic when it comes to clothes and food. My big splurge is having a plane to fly around in.   I play tennis so I invest in shoes and racquets to help but they don't make a big difference. 
It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer. It would be nice to live longer though I admit. 
Polio eradication is a big focus for me. Our last case in Africa was 6 months ago and we are hoping no more show up. It takes over a year to be sure. We still have cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Until we get rid of it there it can spread back to other countries. Pakistan is starting to take this seriously including the army and the government. They need to do the same things that were done in Nigeria. The Taliban makes it very difficult. They have killed women going to vaccinate kids many times.   
Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. I am still working on this problem. 
he doesn't need to download anything from the internet.  He keeps the internet machine on him at all times. So he has direct access 24/7, no downloading necessary   
There are a lot of great causes. It is important not to be frozen trying to pick since it is important to specialize and really learn the area you are trying to help. We picked health inequity as our global thing and educational inequity as our national thing and most of our projects fit into these areas. Part of the beauty of philanthropy is the diversity of causes and approaches that get tried. It is far more risk oriented than government or private sector spending which makes it special when it is done right. 
We have some tough scientific challenges like an HIV cure.  However the toughest thing is helping teachers learn from the best teachers. There are great teachers and the kids who get them are lucky. We should be able to spread those skills but the current system doesn't do it very well. 
Right now there isn't enough R&D going into safe and cheap nuclear energy. I am supporting Terrapower which has a 4th generation design that looks good. It doesn't use Thorium - it uses the 97% of Uranium that normally can't be used for a reactor by breeding and burning. This means fuel will always be cheap. There are a lot of innovations but the key one is that it is far far safer than anything today - not relying on human operators. 
So far we have not being able to use technology to connect people to the needs of the poorest in countries that are far away to tap into their empathy. I think this can be done but it needs some missing creativity. 
The timeframe is longer than I would like. Probably 5 years before we have hundreds of them out in dozens of cities but we can scale up fast after that. 
Bitcoin is an exciting new technology. For our Foundation work we are doing digital currency to help the poor get banking services. We don't use bitcoin specifically for two reasons. One is that the poor shouldn't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn't work.  Overall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and Bitcoin related approaches.  Making sure that it doesn't help terrorists is a challenge for all new technology. 
Government aid funding from rich countries to develop new seeds and help the countries educate their farmers and provide credit to them can make a huge difference. Canada does some of this like the United States. We need to raise African productivity by 1.5 to 2x in order for them to avoid malnutrition and be able to lift themselves out of poverty. It is strange a continent with 70% adults as farmers imports food from countries like the US with 2% farmers. Africa spends $50B net buying food today. With productivity improvement they can offset the weather getting worse and feed their children enough to thrive. &nbsp;  **EDIT**: You can read our letter here: www.gatesletter.com 
Nathan Myhrvold has some amazing modern cuisine stuff that is super tasty. I am not a foodie but his new concoctions are amazing.   I also like Thai and Indian food but it doesn't have to be expensive. 
Mr Bill Gates is busy making Earth a better place for us to live in. He got no time for that funky business mister. 
Butter? Peanut butter? Cheese spread?  Any of these. 
Probably the Porsche 959 that he didn't get to drive for 13 years. 
I'd be extremely surprised if he even had the ability to do so - that would be owned by Microsoft as a company, not by any individual. 
If I hadn't become an actor in the way I did. (being discovered by a director, plucked from obscurity, etc) I would have continued to pursue stand up comedy. probably would have tried to become an actor that way. 
Andy Dwyer is the personification of my comedic schtick. I have been making people laugh with that clown for years and years. Way before I ever did Parks and Rec. He not all of me. But I AM all of him, if that makes any sense. 
Wow. that's a good question. like a kiss marry kill thing?  trick question. I'd marry and kiss them all. And I did!!!

I miss the cast and crew. I miss my friends. I miss the commute. I miss the fact it was a steady gig, all comedy, and took me 7 minutes to get to work.   The hardest part of working on Passengers would be the schedule. There were only two of us primarily through the whole shoot and we worked incredibly long hours. I was homesick a lot of the time. It was a grind.   
no vanity in comedy understanding the element of my job in where I am a prop  i was confident and in good shape when i first came to LA but nobody would cast me in any well written roles. People assumed based on my looks i was an asshole and a one trick pony. I only auditioned to play the douchebag characters. my audition material would be like "Bradley, 24, you hate him immediately"   int. locker room. Bradley looks to our hero, squints his eyes, runs his hands through his thick gelled and frosted tipped hair and says, "Fuck you pussy."  that would be my audition. "Fuck you pussy."  welcome to the OC bitch.   They never let me improv or do comedy. It wasn't until I built a shlubby exterior, which stood in stark contrast to my inner confidence that people gave me room to play. ,   
That was such an amazing time in my life. There are elements I miss. Perhaps most of all, uncertainty.  
Jim Preston Passengers Opens December 21st!!  Thanks guys thats my time. 
Keanu Reeves is awesome. John Wick is the shit. He's been killing it for so long. And hes a great humanitarian.    
Anna Faris is so underrated. She's unbelievable. They need to do this. 
love Pearl Jam! Growing up in Washington i have a very real connection to that music. I was at an impressionable time when it hit. So it will always have a place in my heart. 
haha! Yes. It's amazing i made it out alive. The sequel shoots in a fewmonths. I already have nervous diahrea, diarreah, diarreeah, how the fuck do you spell that? anyways. Yeah. I"m probably gonna die on the sequel. 
More fun? Andy Dwyer. We got to do whole scenes, over and over. It was more stage play. Lots of improv. Guardians of the Galaxy is so fun to watch, don't get me wrong, but making it can be excruciatingly slow and painstaking. When you have so many elements working at once, you might spend all day shooting a piece of the movie that will last 10 seconds.  
Ron Swanson as an intergalactic small government bureaucrat. 
They met at a Blockbuster years ago. They were both reaching for the same copy of Surf Ninjas. The rest is history 
Funny guys can be sexy shirtless. But realness is more important. Exercising for health, overall physical and spiritual well being I highly recommend. Doing it to look good naked is cool, but hardly worth the sacrifice. Work on being funny before sexy. lots of women think funny is sexy anyway. 
hello!  Favorite thing about the PNW is the hard earned summers. Going to the river and floating down with some beers. I love when Mt. Rainier is out. I love the way everything and everyone slows down to feel the sun on their face when it first breaks in summer. Usually you've been through 100 days or more in a row of rain and mistiness.  
I had the best time working with Aubrey. My favorite moments with her were when she would let her guard down, (it didn't happen that often) and I got to see what a sweet and caring person she is. It's not dissimilar to the April character. 
Jen is awesome. She's funny and cool. She's refreshingly tough. She's an amazing actor. It feels good to be around her.   Best memory? So hard to say. I've been at this for 17 years. It's a dream job. No question. There have been so many unforgettable moments. I love what I do for a living.   top 5? Also very difficult. Friday NIght lights Breaking Bad The Wire Game of Thrones  Dual Survival 
We were sitting in our chairs waiting for the next shot and a big set light bulb exploded nearby and she screamed. high pitched. very feminine.  then she immediately looked over at me and said, "Jesus Chris! You scream like a woman! Did everyone just hear Chris?"  and for the rest of the shoot i couldn't convince anyone it wasn't me. I just had to own it.  : ) 
Any other celebrities you've farted on? Is this your thing? Can it be? 
The magic trick he did is literally the one card trick I can do. I've been doing it since I was about 10 and now I'll never be able to do it again thanks to him 
Blitz the mascot!!!!  Just kidding. I like them all. Jimmy Graham is an awesome dude. I've gotten to know Jermain Kearse a little bit. Richard Sherman. Kam Chancellor. I've met a lot of the guys. it's hard to pick. they are an extraordinary group of gentlemen. And I suppose I am biased, being from the PNW. But that group of guys are all class. And it starts from the top down. So a lot of credit goes to Pete and Russell. 
they'd team up after realizing they're married to the same woman 
what weapons we talking? If i have a gun I'd fight the big duck. But if i didn't get weapons, and had to use my bare hands i would fight 100 horses and set myself up in a situation where i have the upper hand based on my terrain like the movie 300.   whoa! movie 300 with duck sized horses! fuck yeah.  
He's already the lead in one Disney property, they would probably avoid casting him in another that is running concurrently.  
Yes, they do. They recall (for me) the actual experience of myself in space - not by words, not by print, but visual reminders, it brings back a very in-depth appreciation. They can be used very well for communicating in speeches, talks, and more to other people who can actually see what i saw and what the camera saw.  
On the Gemini mission in space, on my doctoral thesis at MIT, those techniques were used by Gemini, Apollo and even the space shuttle. But I was very disappointed when it looked like I wouldn't even have a chance to fly in the two-man Gemini program! I was not scheduled to be anything other than the back up crew. A tragedy changed that, and I was a backup pilot on Gemini 9, and then I would be on the primary crew for Gemini 12, the final mission. The #1 air force experiment was on Gemini 9 and 12, but its use was unsuccessful on Gemini 9, and so I became the first astronaut to train underwater in neutral buoyancy. I had been a scuba diver 10 years earlier, and knew that training underwater would be very very effective, and I felt very confident of carrying out the difficult procedures to be able to free-maneuver outside the spacecraft with the equipment (this is what George Clooney's character was doing with the jetpack in Gravity) - unfortunately NASA cancelled that experiment.  
COCONUT ICE CREAM.  Don't waste your time on beaming people up or down. Instead, consider gravity waves as advanced physics of the universe that could be used to travel interstellar distances. And ENJOY floating in space, rather than being decomposed or recomposed in another location.  
*"Where are the billions and billions and billions of people, on what I'm looking at? We're the only 3 that are not back there."*  And we didn't get to celebrate. Because we were out of town.  
I was very close to the top of my class at West Point. And I continued to expand my understanding of the world around me, and the human evolutions here on earth, the achievements perhaps to other people are impressive when I tell them that not only have I been to the North Pole, I haven't been to the South Pole yet, but I have been to the Titanic in a little yellow french submarine. It took an hour and a half just to sink down in the ocean about 2 miles deep to look out the thick glass window and see the Titanic. The visibility was such that we could see the bow, it became very famous in the movie thanks to James Cameron, but the visibility was not so good that you could actually see the bottom of the ocean that the Titanic was resting on. So it was an eerie site, of a ship festooned with rusting metal, like gingerbread. Floating, floating out the window in the Ocean.  
Realize that you are perhaps the most ambitious, the most historical pioneers that the earth has produced since its beginning.  And you are given a great honor in spending the rest of your lives pioneering for mankind.  AND HAVE FUN! 
Drive over to the nearest airport, and enroll in flight classes. You will experience the joy of freedom in the air above, as you study the mechanics of how this is made possible by understanding the construction, the laws of motion, the air that can provide lift when it is moved by propulsion through the air, and stay above the gravity pulling the airplane back down to earth.  
I am @theRealBuzz on Twitter!  They wanted a name that is better than Lunar Larry - and it became Buzz Lightyear because they wanted it to be more genuine. So now that I have changed my name from Edwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr. to Buzz Aldrin, I'm seriously thinking of adding a middle name - so it would become Buzz "Lightyear" Aldrin.  
An aviator! A pilot! After I was a quarterback for Notre Dame.  
Well, 30 Rock means 30 Rockefeller Plaza. My father, in 1925, 1926, in the Reserve of the Air Corps, worked as Aviation Fuel Manager for Standard Oil of New Jersey, that's where I lived at that time, and he would go into NYC and work at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. So when I was asked to consider participating, I jumped for joy, and I can't remember a more pleasant episode of discussions with Tina Fey as we talked about her fictitious mother's (I think it was) love affair that she had with me, Buzz Aldrin. And then we looked at the Moon, and we both sort of cursed at it for various reasons and said - I'll never forget the line - "I walked on your FACE!" 
Well, I prefer the soft singing voice of Karen Carpenter. I have heard Frank Sinatra sing "Fly me to the Moon" almost *too* many times. So I'm interested in composing a new song, entitled "Get your ass to Mars!"   
I have inspired my own video games, 10, 20, 30 years ago, and now there is in Europe a video challenge, a video activity, entitled "Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager." And there game players can build their own space program from the beginning, and from where we are now on into the future, with some of the components that I believe will make great progress in our transportation systems between the Earth and the Moon and Mars in a long-standing reusable way into the future.  I'll have to check out Kerbal Space Program.  
Yes, it was challenging to understand what was necessary to successfully carry out all the training simulations that we, as crewmen, would  experience, and make a very successful use of that training and education. Training was much more extensive, and we dealt with many recoveries from emergencies, and fortunately, participating and observing and existing through the reality of space was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and it was not marred by unexpected hazards or catastrophes.  
The Soviets landed 5 things on the moon including 2 very long lived rovers during the time the Apollo missions were happening. If there was ANY chance that we were faking any part of our missions, wouldn't the very top priority of the soviet missions be to discredit, disprove and utterly embarrass their cold war competition?  Not that there's any reason to have to defend facts from irrational conspiracy theorists... 
I don't thinK I've ever really used that. I don't want to be shockingly bragging. I would rather people understand that there is a very, very fortunate American who was given the opportunity, and was in the right place at the right time to have the moment of a lifetime. My mother was born - her name was Marianne Moon. And she was born in 1903, the year that the Wright Brothers first flew. I participated with great honor in becoming one of the first to land on the moon, and now I am devoting and have devoted many years of my life to enabling Americans to lead international nations to permanence on the planet Mars. I was lucky enough to have been born on this planet earth, in this admirable country of the United States of America.  
Yes, I did. I met Carl Sagan and his wife. Both were very dedicated people to explaining to young people and to all people the benefits to be derived from space, the history of how our universe was formed, and the history of the advancement of the technologies that hundreds of years ago, enabled present day nations to use them to begin to add more science discoveries in space. And to write stories and television series that reach many people and after his passing away, you have a rejuvenation of the series COSMOS, featuring a very good friend of mine, Neil deGrasse Tyson. We were on a commission together to look at the future of space activities for the United States, that was about 12 years ago, and we've been good friends ever since. I was on his TV show. He did Michael Jackson's moonwalk far better than I did on Dancing With the Stars.  
That was not at all tempting. I wanted my white spacesuit to remain as clean as possible!  
Well, I woke up before the alarm went off so I could re-arrange all of the pills and vitamins that I have to take with me on my next trip. Then I enjoyed reading the newspaper, having a cup of coffee, and beginning to eat my breakfast. I haven't finished it yet, and my watch says "10 minutes to 1" in the afternoon.  
Well, I'm sure it would still be the most favorite airplane in my career of flying - the Sabre F86 cleft wing , which allowed me to be credited with 2 Russian-built Mig-15 destroyed during the Korean War. Where I was in 1953.  
I think the words that he used, about the actions of the moment, and what they meant, in the future or for the greater understanding of mankind, were somewhat similar to my words that were spur of the moment. His 'giant leap for mankind' and my observation of the desolation and magnificence that was on the moon, viewed by any individual who would look out and observe with their eyes, the actual visual confirmation of what we intellectually understood we were looking at - but to actually *see* - something so unlike anything that could be observed on earth. It was "what can one person do" and "what do we know about earth." 
Does you fink man will ever walk on the sun?  Buzz: The sun is far too hot for man to walk on it's surface  What about in the winter, when the sun is cooler...?  
They should have realized they were going to be overbooked once the initial check-in closed and by the time everyone got to the gate they could have made an announcement. I feel like people would have been more likely to volunteer to be bumped at the gate rather than when they're already settled into their seats on the plane. 
AMA Request Someone to Discuss Their Legal Case.  Good luck with that. 
Stupid question but is the $850 to find a flight or do they reschedule and you get to keep the $850? 
When I was 12 years old, I took the plane with my 15 year old brother. On the runway, he got stung by a bee on the neck and immediately had an allergic reaction. They stopped the airplane and had an ambulance come and bring him to the hospital. I was left alone in the airplane after being bumped to first class. First and last time I sat in first class. 
It really depends how it comes out. The people who physically man-handled him were law enforcement and not United employees. So if anything he can charge them, but we all know how law enforcement seems to take a slap on the hand for most incidents.   I'd be interested to see how his lawyers word it specifically to go after both of them.  
Generally speaking it is not purely random.  If he was traveling with family they wouldn't keep the family on the plane and drag him off.  If he had top tier status, they wouldn't have dragged him off either.  If he bought the cheapest ticket, had no status, had other flights to choose from - then it would put him more into the "person to be taken off the plane" category. 
Inb4 the Daily Mail reports that he was arrested twice for money laundering and secretly owns an international prostitution ring. 
Exactly. Just up the offer until someone bites. Instead, they did this. Idiots. 
Is it $800 plus they book you on a different flight free of charge? If not, not worth it.  
It's televised in Asia too. My family in Hong Kong called and asked my parents about it. 
Incompetence.  Overbooking happens a lot but it should be dealt with before boarding.  They know if the flight is overbooked before boarding because passengers have to check in before boarding begins, therefore they should have been able to tell that the flight was overbooked before boarding ever began. 
I'd like to announce that I'm officially boycotting United. Granted, I had no plans to book a flight in the near future and probably couldn't afford it to begin with, but by god I'm boycotting those sons of bitches. 
Probably very little or nothing    -airline pilot  
I read somewhere he was chinese buuut I've noticed 'Chinese' tends to be the default for 'asian person'. Looking at the video, he actually does look a lot like my late Korean grandfather. :( 
I think it was one part the bystander effect and second, the fact that people thought that if they intervened, they would probably be thrown off for intervening, which is a more reasonable scenario that *shitty airline lottery winner*. 
It's not really something that happens in Europe, this is the first time ive really heard about something like this actually happening and I've flew over Europe a lot.  
I haven't seen any concrete proposal on how you would do the regulation. I think it is worth discussing because I share the view of Musk and Hawking that when a few people control a platform with extreme intelligence it creates dangers in terms of power and eventually control. 
It is worth learning how to read a bit faster. I am not sure what the best course for that is nowadays. I had a friend who took Evelyn Wood and told me what they said.  I have a rule that I always finish a book once I start it. This might now work for everyone. I only read 2 books at a time - in fact usually just one unless one of them is so complex I need to mix things up. I read a lot at night and my biggest problem is that I stay up to late and regret it the next day when I haven't had as much sleep as I would like. 
I am concerned about biological tools that could be used by a bioterrorist. However the same tools can be used for good things as well.  Some people think Hoverboards were bad because they caught on fire. I never got to try one. 
Microsoft and others are working on quantum computing. It isn't clear when it will work or become mainstream. There is a chance that within 6-10 years that cloud computing will offer super-computation by using quantum. It could help use solve some very important science problems including materials and catalyst design. 
I think it shows Satya looking at how the market is changing and being willing to change how things have been done. His embrace of the cloud and mobile including doing software on other people's mobile platforms are also great examples of that. 
I agree that our schools have not improved as much as we want them to. There are a lot of great teachers but we don't do enough to figure out what they do so well and make sure others benefit from that. Most teachers get very little feedback about what they do well and what they need to improve including tools that let them see what the exemplars are doing.  Technology is starting to improve education. Unfortunately so far it is mostly the motivated students who have benefited from it. I think we will get tools like personalized learning to all students in the next decade.   A lot of the issue is helping kids stay engaged. If they don't feel the material is relevant or they don't have a sense of their own ability they can check out too easily. The technology has not done enough to help with this yet. 
The problem of how we prevent a small group of terrorists using nuclear or biological means to kill millions is something I worry about. If Government does their best work they have a good chance of detecting it and stopping it but I don't think it is getting enough attention and I know I can't solve it.  I love both sushi and thai food. Since I like them better than my family does I have them for lunch a lot. 
I love my work. I love meeting the scientists and field workers. I have the flexibility to work less if I wanted to and I do take vacations now. When I was in my 20's I didn't believe in vacation so I have mellowed. I feel super lucky that I can be involved in the Foundation work with Melinda for another 30 years assuming my health holds up. 
Sometimes you just get very lucky based on the configuration. I forget the exact time but I think I had a time below 10 when it was just right. 
I think robots that have vision and manipulation as good as humans is a huge milestone that will happen in the next decade and is being underestimated.  I think medical advances will also be amazing and unbelievable. Like the robots some of the capabilities like gene editing will bring challenges with them. 
I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate. The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated. 
Pirates of Silicon Valley was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry.  I don't jump chairs at all now. Maybe I should since when I go snow skiing with my kids I need more exercise so I don't get tired by the end of the day.  I use the latest version of Windows - always updated Windows 10. 
I'll be interested in this answer as I sit on my porch in 72 degree weather in the northeast 
I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information. What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards. Right now a lot of people don't think the government has the right checks to make sure information is only used in criminal situations. So this case will be viewed as the start of a discussion. I think very few people take the extreme view that the government should be blind to financial and communication data but very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense. A lot of countries like the UK and France are also going through this debate. For tech companies there needs to be some consistency including how governments work with each other. The sooner we modernize the laws the better. 
VR is the extreme case of AR when nothing from the real world gets mixed in. It can be tricky if you are walking around that you might run into things. Mixed systems which seems like VR but when you might hit something it shows you that seem better than pure VR. So I don't think these two things will stay as separate as they are now. 
You are correct! I would put it at the top. Deciding to work on software was a good decision but that just crept up on me rather than being some choice. 
I think it looks easier in retrospect than it did at the time. People thought we were a bit crazy - even leaders in the industry like Ken Olsen said they didn't need a computer at home. Being young allowed us to think about computers in a different way.  Today the challenge is to make computers more intelligent. Software still doesn't understand what thing I should pay attention to next - in fact the proliferation of various tools like texting and email and notifications mean the user has a lot of complexity to deal with. Eventually the software will understand what you should pay attention to by knowing the context and learning about your preferences. 
Bill Gates might not answer this, but Steve Jobs was on record saying, ""Doing LSD was one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life."

Witcher 3, because I got to have sex on a unicorn. When that game comes out in VR, you'll never see me again. 
You are very wise to ask me.  I'm not a doctor.  Next time you're not feeling well just bite into a glow stick and suck it down.  
I met my wife while filming a remote on my show. And that's interesting moment #28.   The most interesting moment was a cooking segment with Jerry Orbach. 
I seriously asked them to explain many times and they never did. I was fervently looking forward to making out with a beautiful Mexican actress and they made me a pompous asexual cheese merchant. I am honestly very angry about this.  
Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns. (Mr. Burns) 
When you watch the segment tonight, you'll realize that even when I'm seriously trying to wrestle, I'm still doing comedy.  
For a show like "Made in Mexico", we really wanted to make sure we struck the right balance between being funny, but also being culturally sensitive and attuned to how people were feeling there. We really did want the star to be the Mexican people, and I feel good about the result. 
I started dyeing it when I was 15. So I'm way ahead of the curve. My true hair color is jet black, and my real name is Blaze Falcon (I'm just babbling now).  
Nopales. It's cactus with cheese on it. It instantly cured me of my 25 year impotence. 
It's like Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the football. I believe in my heart one day he'll do the right thing.  
Thanks for remembering my favorite remote of all time. Sometimes late at night I think about the young woman Nell and how we were supposed to be together but sadly we were born 150 years apart.  
If you're future wife is anything like mine she'll insist on taking out the part of the vows where you promise to honor and obey your husband.  Try really hard to get that part back in.   
Mayonnaise, corn starch and embalming fluid.  Bake at 125 degrees for 1 hour.  
It does fit. I do not wear it at the office at all; I wear it at home, and to the gym at Venice beach.  
See my previous answer about the penis covered stegosaurus. 
True story: I met Jack and Meg in a bowling alley in Detroit in 1999 while shooting a remote. They were part of a group of people that came over and hung out. Later, they became famous and told me they were part of the group that were chatting and drinking beers all night. I totally lucked out. Since then, I just hang out in bowling alleys looking for future rock stars. 
I was in this scenario two years ago. I wounded one before nine of them took me down and ripped the flesh from my bones with their baby teeth. 
My son really got me into 21 Pilots other than that my wife and I like to slow dance to John Grisham audio books.   
Riley, I yelled at you because you exceeded my 'one almond an hour' rule. That wastes water (an almond takes 1.1 gallons of water to produce). 
The Asparagus, because I could change the odor of your urine against your will.  
It's a tie between Fruit Loops and Cap'n Crunch with Crunchberries 
Thanks for calling that an incredible display. The goal I scored was so incredibly fake that I felt bad for the goalie who had to pretend to miss a ball moving at 2mph. 
Harry S. Truman. Do not screw with Harry S. Truman.  
Go to Pino's Pizza in Cleveland Circle. There's only two tables but it's the only pizza my family and I eat.  I've been going there since elementary school.  
I'd like to keep this going as long as I can. It's really fun, and at this stage in my career it feels like something new and exciting. I've always loved my job, but the one downside is being in the studio every day. The chance to travel and try my comedy out on people who speak different languages is a great joy. 
I got a complete 50/50 response on the beard. Half the people loved it, half the people hated it. Since it was my kids who hated it, it had to go. Don't fear, I still keep it in the attic with my wedding dress. 
That's a great question. What surprised me the most is how little I have to adjust. Especially in Mexico. The Mexican people are really funny and sharp, and they always got the joke instantly - and they weren't afraid to give me a hard time. I'm very comfortable being the underdog when I do remotes, and all the Mexican people I encountered were great and generous improvisors.  
Jeff Ross was molested by a puppet in 1958. When he testified in court he had to point to a human to show where the puppet touched him.  
Great idea. I'd love to do a travel show. In fact, I'm going to go shoot one in Mexico right now. It will air tonight at 10pm on TBS. Look for your name in the credits under "Idea By".  
Without intimate photos it's hard to say. I'll send you some.  
President Vicente Fox was very funny, and although he was talking about a serious issue, he came prepared almost like a comedian. He entirely caught the spirit of what we were trying to do, and he's a big part of the show. 
My father Dr. Thomas F. O'Brien who works at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston has been working hard on this problem for decades.  He's the smartest guy I know.  He and his team have been working hard on this serious issue for a long time.   
in 40 years time we'll all be brains in jars connected to a giant server. But yes, my brain will travel the world. 
I hope he does more episodes with just him and Aaron in the future. The celebs are often funny but I like the show more as a two man deal. 
I have a scar from an appendectomy on my lower right abdomen.  I have three cats named Thor, Maow and Cleo and the only one I like is Thor.  My ATM Pin is 1494.   
I'm from Boston, and a huge Patriots fan. We had to edit out all the times I tried to kiss him. 
My favorite moment was when I threw the big pass that won the game. Or maybe that was Jimmy Hennessey.   Seriously, I went back to Brookline High School about 15 years ago, and it was so much nicer then when I was there. They actually had a sushi bar (not kidding).  I felt like I had gone to high school during the Great Depression. 
I went to the Trotsky museum; it's the house where Leon Trotsky was murdered with an ice pick. I think it's safe to say that I'm the only late night host to ever go there.  
Ah, the old classic question. I've always been a penis stegosaurus guy. 
Don't make fun of Mike Sweeney - he served our country valiantly during the Korean war. We give Mike Sweeney the same hormones they inject into old Redwoods. Currently there's a branch growing out between his shoulder blades. 
Absolutely not. The Mexican people were warm, friendly and eager to participate in the show. We spent a week there. I met thousands of people and I never felt the slightest hint of trepidation or hostility.   
In all honesty, after begging hundreds of Mexicans for donations to the wall, I did not get one single peso. 
I think there's a kind of bacteria they spray on oil spills that turn them into delicious frothy strawberry milkshakes. If that's true, that's my favorite type of bacteria.  
Thanks for being such a loyal fan! I did try the taco from stands, I did not try the vanilla ice cream. The tacos were great, but Jorge Ramos had me try a really hot sauce, and I still can't feel my teeth. 
If you look at my show since 1993, I've always made fun of the president. Trump is the president now, and I'm always going to do jokes about him. That said, the overall thrust of our humor has never been overtly political, and I still think of our show as more silly than anything else.  
I dare you to name a food that mac n cheese does not go with. 
Not that I've noticed. Airlines still make the additional money from uninformed, so it might be silly to get rid of hidden-city opportunities. 
Yes. If the airline decides to reroute you due to a plethora of factors this can happen. However it is rare. 
It turns out services that provide airfare data make it really difficult to facilitate what Skiplagged does, i.e. search by stopovers. I had to figure out an efficient and scalable solution to this huge obstacle, given that airfare is lots of data that changes every few minutes.  The website and app don't make money right now, but there are lots of ways Skiplagged as a travel service can in the future (e.g. hotel commissions).  
Never had a complaint. We tell you to book a round-trip as two one-ways if it involves missing a flight. 
You reminded me of how difficult it was to educate consumers. It feels weird, but fortunately the trick is real here. 
Pretend you live in California. You want to go to Denver Colorado. The ticket is $550. But there's also a flight to Nashville Tennessee that has a layover in Denver. This flight is only $300. So you book the flight to Nashville and just get off your plane when it stops in Denver and you stay in Denver.  The only issue with this is it's a one way ticket and you cannot check your baggage. you either have to mail it to your destination beforehand or just have carry on baggage.  
You'll appear as having missed your departure on your origin and it invalidates the rest of the trip unless you have a customer service agent override it.  Say your plane to second leg was significantly delayed due to maintenance and you just decided to rent a car and drive to the next airport instead and told the agent and had him exception it.  I've heard of it happening a few times when someone would just decide to go from PIT to IAD or EWR via car to make their flight out to another area. 
Fellow engineer super interested in this question.  
Right now with the data collected from various forums like Flyertalk and other travel bloggers, 45-60 days out is generally accepted sweet spot time. 
Same issue. It asks me if I'm connected to the Internet lol. 
Or a straw poll that it edited into the original charity description area. 
Yes, if they catch you doing this they can ban you from the airline. 
Hey fellow RPI grad! Thanks for the nice comment. My favorite part was that the computer science curriculum prepared me well for the working world. Least favorite was the boring city. You? 
All the airlines have some sort of agreement. If you missed a flight, you missed a flight. They can't really prove you missed on purpose and therefore violated the contract. 
Glad you found Skiplagged useful! Money is a scarce resource...definitely word of mouth. 
I've never had a plane sit and wait because someone wasn't there. I'd imagine they'd only wait if like.. the pilot didn't show up. They don't sit and wait an extra amount of time because grandma thought her flight was on a different day, do they? 
I'm a travel agent dude. While I would probably never sell these to a client or even recommend them due to a duty of care, I can't see anything stopping me from booking any of these flights. Min/Max connection times don't really have any affect here... 
The way we help users book is by just providing information. This way, there's no link back to skiplagged. 
I noticed a hidden-city opportunity while searching for flights. Did research and realized these opportunities are quite prevalent--25% of common routes offer cheaper fares. Also noticed other things like how two one-ways can be cheaper than round-trips, combining one-ways to form a route can be cheaper than normal one-ways, and how two round-trips can be cheaper than one round-trip. Wanted to build something that presents a whole new class of fares to consumers. 
That question might be too hard for any human being.   Greatest invention... I just described one, which was a device to pop anywhere - real tiny, into a glove compartment, a backpack, whatever - and be able to locate it, wherever it is in the world. There are some devices that kind of claim that now, but they don't really work sufficiently.   A device that gives us one extra hour per day? 
Well, obviously Apple is the most important thing ever in my life, and it would be no matter what I might go off and try to do outside and say. No I would only say one thing, I am Apple.   When I left in '85, the same as when I left in '81, I actually remained an employee on a slight payroll. I had a letter from apple wishing me luck. I sat on a blackboard and showed them what my intent was to go and create as a product, and there was absolutely no conflict. I like to live a life where kinda everyone likes me. I'm just not bad. If somebody is bad to me, I'm still good to them.   Somehow I grew up with these values that seem kind of incredible, so I always was on good terms with Apple and they always liked me, I'm always welcome. I could come by, Steve Jobs would always make sure I had a badge that could get me into any building. I didn't use it much, but I can go there. The only trouble is I'll get mobbed.  
He said on Conan that he never had a big confrontation with Jobs like portrayed in the Fassbender movie. They took a lot of complaints from various employees and made the Woz character the mouthpiece  for all that. 
Yes.  My dog is AWESOME!!!  ;)  As far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life I would say no.  The bullying was only on camera.  The minute the director yelled cut I was definitely one of the "in crowd".  lol  
I remember meeting you at Hedwig (great show by the way).    Because of the popularity of P&R it's changed many things in my life.  99% good...1% not so good.  I can honestly say that part of the 99% is the interaction I have with the fans.  I know a lot of actors aren't happy to stop and talk with their fans but I'm always happy to take pics and chat a little.  There were many MANY years as a working actor that nobody knew who the hell I was.  The fact that I was lucky enough to land a show like Parks and get to have an impact on peoples lives is something I will never take for granted.  I'm honored (and humbled) that people like my work and want to come up to let me know.  For those wondering what the 1% is that isn't so great...people sneaking pictures.  I would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it.  For some reason that seems much more invasive to me.  :) 
Missing P&R is something I will do the rest of my life.  I spent six years (7 seasons) with the greatest cast and crew that has ever been assembled (in my humble opinion).  Thankfully the cast are constantly texting each other and staying in touch.  I keep in touch with a lot of the crew too.  That being said...nothing will ever be like going to work every day to laugh with people you truly loved.  As far as people being different from their characters...As actors I think we all bring a certain part of ourselves to every role.  It's just natural.  Nick Offerman is a smart man who can build anything.  So that's like Ron.  On the other hand I think politically they might be at odds.   
Great question.  I've been blessed to have been working in this crazy business for over twenty years.  Because of the popularity of Parks I'll always be best known as Jerry which is a gift.  I love when I get to sink my teeth into a dramatic role.  Dark comedies are my favorites.  It's one of the things that led me to Middle Man.  I'm not the "funny" guy in the film yet I get a lot of laughs.  I love getting a new script and figuring out what I'm going to do with it.    As far as finding something I did in the past...hmmm...I did an episode of Diagnosis Murder where I got to play a crazed serial killer.  I had a lot of fun with that.  I would also check out a remake of Harvey I did many years ago with Leslie Nielsen, Swoosie Kurtz and Harry Anderson.  It was one of my first films.  I look like a baby.  It was an amazing experience.  :) 
Great question.  From what I understand one of the writers were standing next to me at the urinal and thought it was time to mix real life and TV life.  Made perfect sense to me.  lol  ;) 
They were all funny.  What a lot of people don't know is that after every scene we did a "fun run".  That's where we got to play around and do whatever we wanted while telling the same story that was on the page.  Most of us had an improv background so it made sense to let us play together.  We did that EVERY DAY.  I think it's one of the reasons we stayed so close as a cast.  That being said...Chris Pratt is so off the cuff funny that it's crazy.  Really really funny.  I had fun working with each and ever one of them.  That's not Hollywood bullshit.  I loved them all...and still do.  :) 
Thanks so much.  My dogs names are Chase (the white one) and Stella (the black one).  They're both rescues.  Last year I lost both of my other dogs to cancer.  I don't have kids so the dogs become like children (some people think that's crazy...that's OK).  When they passed away I didn't think I could ever go through it again.  After nine months my gut was telling me that it was time again.  I went to the Linda Blair World Heart Foundation and found Chase.  I knew within two minutes of meeting him that he needed to be with me for the rest of his life.  A few months later I went to the Amanda Foundation and met Stella.  She had obviously been abused and needed some loving.  They're brought the smile back to my face after losing my other two pups.  :) 
It's totally different than any other role I've played.  My character Lenny starts out in the same vein as Jerry from Parks.  A sweet, nice guy.  Unfortunately for Lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to Las Vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by Andrew J. West).  This turns his life upside down.  From that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude.  Playing the character was terrifying because if I didn't make it work the film doesn't work.  From what I hear I did it justice.  :) 
I love when I get to different types of characters.  That's what actors do.  Like I mentioned earlier it's hard not to be typecast but it's part of the challenge of being an actor.  :) 
I try to keep something from every shoot I'm on.  Most of it just sits in a box.  I figure someday when I'm old (well...older) I'll want to take a trip down memory lane.  I have the Jerry Gergich Conference Room RIP plaque on my desk.  I see it every day.  :) 
You nailed it.  Li'l Sebastian will be starring as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men".  Can't wait to see it.  :) 
Tell you dad thanks from me.  Without our Kickstarter campaign we would not have been able to make the film that we did.  I'm still blown away that strangers gave us their hard earned money to help us make our dream project.  It's very humbling.  I mentioned earlier that I have too many all time favorite actors to mention.  I'm been blessed by being around not only amazingly talented people but also amazing good people.  For me that's more important.  Getting to work with Andrew J. West, Josh McDermott and Anne Dudek on Middle Man was an unexpected treat.  I didn't know any of them and they came with their A games.  Really amazing people and actors.  :) 
I wouldn't say overly nice.  We were all just good friends doing good work and laughing our asses off every day.  :) 
My favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on Parks.  He had also worked on The Office.  His name is Dean Holland.  He really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us.  My favorite actor that I've worked with is too broad of a question.  I've fallen in love with so many people I've worked with over the years.  By "love" I mean I loved being around them.  :) 
LOL  That's a great analogy.  I'm not sure that's what I was thinking at the time but who knows?    As far as pulling classic Jerry moves....every day.  We all do.  I won an Emmy last month and as I was walking up the steps to get the award I just kept thinking "don't fall...don't fall". If I had fallen it would have been another "Jerry" moment that I would hear about forever even though I won the award for a different show.  lol  :) 
I've thought about this question many many times so credit for the question goes to me.  ;)  The answer is ... 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz.  :) 
I thank God every day that the acting thing worked out.  Otherwise I have no idea what I'd be doing.  I guess because I'm a talker and a bit gregarious that I could have gone into sales but honestly I don't know.  A lot of my family around me are in the trades...like pipe coverers and fitters.  I'm too damn uncoordinated and lazy to do that so again...THANK YOU GOD FOR LETTING THIS WORK OUT!!!!!  :) 
Totally thought up by Aubrey during the last commercial break.  My favorite part when watching the video is how the other cast members reacted when they realized what was happening.  Aubrey is a super funny person.  She knew it wouldn't be funny to make out with Pratt or Scott.  She knew it had to be with the old fat guy to get the real laugh.  I was happy to oblige.  :) 
The joke was funny but his laugh made it legendary 
I typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions".  ;) 
I think it's multiple reasons, including that one.  In season two, it's mentioned that he had plastic surgery, and he explains that it was in the wake of getting hit by a fire truck.  In season six, he tells Chris that he gained "a lot of sympathy weight" and that he used to look like Chris before he had kids.  So what this means is Gayle fell in love with a very different-looking person - a skinnier and probably better-looking pre-accident Gary, who still had a massive schlong, and probably still had his kind, gentle personality.  We see the photo album of the experiences he had with Gayle, and he mentions how much he valued going home to his family right at 5 - they built a solid foundation for their relationship, which means after all of what changed, she still loved him because they'd build such a strong marriage, and also because of his massive schlong. 
I've never been able to see if I have mumps.  When I go to look I'm always distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.  ;) 
Nothing but nature that night.  I didn't know that was going to happen.  Aubrey leaned over and said "you wanna make out during the Li'l Sebastian song".  Within .01 seconds I said yes.  As a guy who doesn't get roles as the romantic lead I listened to Rob Lowe's advice.  Just follow whatever the girl does.  So when we started kissing and I felt Aubrey tongue make its move I knew all bets were off.  lol  I'll be on Seth Meyers next Wednesday, June 14th.  Check it out.  Maybe Aubrey will surprise me and we'll make out again.  mmmm  ;) 
Thank you so much.  I love that scene too.  Any Jerry's on the crew?  YES!  Because I love them all so much I will not name names but I can tell you that there was the occasional mishap caused by the same person many times.  lol  Of course we still loved him.  :) 
I'm obviously not him but I think the show ended perfectly. I don't know if they can top that ending. 
My best bud was Retta (Donna).  Our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them.  Our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so I think that bonded us right off the bat.  We were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out.  I had lunch with Retta last week.  She's one of my favs in life.  :) 
HUGE Billy Joel Fan.  I was on a show yesterday talking about his song "My Life" as one of my all time favorites.  Billy tries to avoid me because of the Christie Brinkley issue.  He knows I could have taken her away from him.  EASY!  lol  ;) 
Awesome question.  Really something I've never thought about.  I would say that initially they would get along great.  They're both very devoted to family and inherently good people.  The journey that Lenny ends up on is not something Jerry would ever go along with so their friendship wouldn't last.  A night out for them would definitely involved a sundae.  :) 
Awesome question.  WOW!  I'm not sure which way to go.  On one had Pratt has turned himself into a physical machine.  On the other hand Nick is very smart and might be able to outmaneuver Chris.  Damn...I have to go with a draw.  :) 
DJ Roomba haunts my dreams.   I still wake up thinking I hear him coming down the hall.  Even talking about it now has me on edge.  ;) 
Mr. O'Heir?  Who the hell is that?  lol  Great question.  There's certainly a part of Jerry in Jim.  At least I hope so.  I think that Jerry is a very kind and caring person.  I would like to think that I have those attributes as well.  Unfortunately I don't have the temperament that Jerry has.  I can upset and people know it.  Jerry just seems to let it all roll off his shoulders.    I've always been a kind of people pleaser.  I'm not sure how healthy that is but it's who I am.  I've gotten better as I've gotten older which makes me happy but ultimately it's in my core to try and make people  feel comfortable...sometimes at my own expense.  Damn.  I need therapy NOW!  lol  ;) 
The Kardashian outtake is one of the funniest moments I've ever experience on any set ever.  Chris Pratt is so damn funny and he hits you with it when you least expect it.   For those who don't know what I'm talking about just go to You Tube and type in Parks and Rec and Kardashian.  You'll love it.  :) 
While I'm doing this REDDIT I've also been texting with the cast of P&R.  I have a Parks Fam text link on my phone.  We're always in contact whether it's to break balls or share what's going on with our lives.  The love you see on the screen only works because it was real off screen.  :) 
People always ask about regrets.  I don't think they're very healthy and certainly aren't going to help us today.  That being said...one of my regrets is not being involved in my high school theater department.  When I was a kid you were labeled depending on what you did or who you hang out with.  There were the burn outs, stoners, jocks, brains and a few others I'm probably forgetting.  In my day if you were part of the theater crowd you were known as a drama fag.  Unfortunately I let that term stop me from doing something that I probably would have loved.  Words are powerful and when you're young you don't realize that it just doesn't matter.  If I could go back to those days now knowing what I do I'd be happy to be called a drama fag.  :)  Tell them to work hard and enjoy every minute.  They will also make friendships that will last a lifetime.  :) 
The popular answer is going to be Offerman but IMO it's Aubrey Plaza. 
I have soooo many favorite episode of Parks.  The one I like to always mention is the season 2 episode called "The Hunting Trip".  I think it's one of my all time favs because it was the first time we were all out of the office together (other than April and Andy) and you got to see who we were in that world.  The scene where Donna (the awesome Retta) realizes her Mercedes has been shot is one of my all time favorite scenes of the whole series.    I also loved the Harvest Festival and the episode where Ben and Jerry had their day out together.  Ben had set up a special day for he and Leslie but she wasn't available.  He ended up doing everything with Jerry.  So damn funny.  I can honestly tell you that there is no least favorite episode that we shot.  Not trying to avoid the question...there just wasn't.  I have great memories of all of them.  :) 
Great question.  Mike Schur doesn't get talked about enough.  I can tell you that, in my opinion, Mike is a comic genius.  He knows what works and what doesn't.  We were lucky to have Mike with us throughout the run. Many times a show creator (runner) will leave after a show becomes successful because they'll be given other opportunities to start new projects.  Mike did start new projects (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) but never left us.  His voice is in every episode of P&R.  I think that's why the show never lost its strength.  Mike never handed us off to someone else.  Between him and Amy they were our fearless leaders and they took great care of us.  :) 
I love them too.  Thank you.  They love to roll and creative tons of dirt in my house. lol  When they play fight it gets so intense that sometimes I think they must have hurt each other.  They run at full speed and just smack into each other.  Two seconds later they do it again and their tales are wagging.  Crazy but so fun to watch.  They both love the dog park too.  And of course walks.  :) 
You saw me in Roseanne?  That's awesome.  Unfortunately I've never been on that show.  lol  But seriously, I used to watch Roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no.  You must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy.  ;)  As far as the reboot goes...I'm not sure.  Some things are better left alone.  :) 
Fart Attack is definitely classic.  I like the old school original with Mark Brandanowicz.  We were playing a game in the office that Jerry never wanted to play.  We had to dig dirt up on each other.  Jerry finally relents and says to Mark "I hear you've got two unpaid parking tickets" (big f'ing deal) and Mark says "I hear your adoptive mother smokes pot".  He looks at me and realizes he's hit a nerve.  He says "I'm sorry.  You didn't know your mom smoked pot?"  Jerry says..."I didn't know I was adopted".  The first and best burn for me.  :) 
There were so many outtakes that should NEVER see the light of day.  lol  We did some filthy silly stuff sometimes.  On the other hand we also all had our moments of brilliance when we were doing a fun run so I'm sure there's some stuff that I've forgotten that would have been fun to see in the show.  Ultimately our co creator Mike Schur always did what was best for the show.  He would never put in a guaranteed laugh if it didn't move the story forward. :) 
Aubrey and I dated for ten years before we eventually broke up due to a side relationship I was having with Joan Calamezzo.  It wasn't easy on any of us and I take full responsibility for the breakup.  That being said it didn't help with Aubrey started dating Joe from the Sewage Department.  That really hurt.  ;)  lol 
I just heard about that minutes ago.  I feel terrible.  She was a very very sweet lady.  For those who don't know Glenne played Ben's mother on Parks.  We had a lot of fun with her son set.  What a shame.  She was way too young.  :( 
Final seasons (and episodes) are tough.  I think the pressure to go out with an amazing story is tough to do.  I know I'm biased but I think that the writers at Parks nailed it.  I love the time jump and the fact that we get to see where these characters end up.  Some of my favorites shows didn't quite nail it for me but Parks did.  Again...I'm a bit biased.  lol  :) 
Wikileaks twitter linked to a conspiracy site which claims Hillary had a seizure AND sent hand signals to Lester Holt during the debate (truepundit) to push the idea that Hillary wanted to "drone Assange." This random sketchy right wing propaganda site became the "source" for this report that got reported the world over because of Wikileaks.  That's just an example 
Because he's obviously trying to get asylum. Being stuck in a bedroom for years with nothing but an internet connection probably does some shit to a man's mind.  I wouldn't doubt some "hackers" gave him the DNC info, with promise of some kind of freedom from his current situation.  
Yeah...timing it just as Jeff Sessions hearing is started... 
Is this AMA his first "public" appearance since his disappearance? If so, it's a pretty weird way to come back... 
Compromised like... I don't know, tweeting Pizzagate nonsense and selling "lock her up" merchandise? 
Surprise surprise, "Julian" ignores every good question in this thread.  
Thank you! I was always kind of bewildered by *Team America*, I think because it's hard for us to understand what our images are in public, I think we're not good judges of that, and when I saw myself on screen just only able to say my own name and not really that well, I kind of wondered "Wow, is that how people perceive me?" At that point I just kind of was like, I'm a screenwriter and an actor, and like really? I can barely say my own name? So I was always bewildered by that, and I never talked to Trey and Matt about that. And Incidentally, I believe those two are geniuses, and I don't use that word lightly. I think they are absolute geniuses, and what they've done is awesome and I'm a big fan of theirs, but I never quite understood that one. But I will say this. Those of us who were parodied in that video were parodied because we were against the Iraq war, and we went on the record against that war, and so history is on my side not theirs. 
I think the answer to that is clear and I'll let you fill in the blanks. 
Thank you, and I'm glad I'm your favorite actor. You have my favorite user name of anybody I've ever seen. It was an easy decision. Once Paul Greengrass said he wanted to do it, I was in, but we didn't have a story. I mean it was nine years in the making because we didn't want to force it if it wasn't there, and so once we realized it was there we all jumped on board, but before that it was an agonizing process as we tried to figure out if there even was a story to tell.  
That's a really tough question because I've worked with so many really wonderful people, people who I admire a lot and become friends with. Choosing one would be really tough but I have to say, going back in my career, Casey Affleck is one of the best actors that I've ever seen in my life. Growing up with him, he's 5 years younger than me, he's kind of like a little brother to me, but watching his work develop over the years has been really fun. There's a movie that I produced that's coming out called Manchester by the Sea. I'm as proud of that as anything I've ever been a part of. Casey is the lead in that movie, Kenny Lonergan directed it, and Casey is absolutely brilliant in that movie. I'm really proud to see what the world thinks of this movie, it's a beautiful little movie.  
omg. I'm making tacos tonight. I hope he responds soon so I can make Damon tacos! 
Congrats, this may be the creepiest AMA question I've come across. 
I've never been approached to do that, I'd totally be into it. I'm really interested to see where entertainment heads as these video games, the graphic are getting so good, and VR is getting so good, and you know, what's going to happen to movies? What are the implications for movies, and does this morph into a new kind of story telling, and what is that, and can I be a part of it? You know, ultimately those of us who make movies are storytellers and we want to gather you around and tell you stories. If gaming is the way to do that I'm all for looking into it, but nobody has asked me as of yet. 
We are planning to send the InSight lander to Mars in 2016, which will be lander designed to detect Mars-quakes.  We also have a rover in development for the 2020s (same basic design as MSL/Curiosity) and NASA is considering the science that might fly on the next Mars orbiter to be launched sometime after the 2020 rover.      The instruments that are chosen to fly are selected because they can accomplish the science goals of the mission, so as the science goals change - with new discoveries - instruments will be proposed and selected accordingly.   The food at JPL is actually quite good!  Wood-fired pizza, burgers, sandwiches, good salad bar, etc.  --LT 
These features are on steep slopes, so our present rovers would not be able to climb up to them. Because liquid water appears to be present, these regions are considered special regions where we have to take extra precautions to prevent contamination by earth life. Our current rovers have not been sterilized to the degree needed to go to an area where liquid water may be present. -RZ 
We think this is a very small amount of water -- maybe just enough to wet the top layer of the surface of Mars. The streaks are ~4-5 meters wide and ~200-300 meters long. -- LT 
Presently, NASA is looking into the possibility of sending humans to the vicinity of Mars in the early 2030s. In this scenario, the earliest humans to the surface would be in the late 2030s. -RZ 
Think of this as a "seep" not a flow. We have not seen flowing water on the surface. We see something that darkens the soil, which may be just a wetting action but still involves (briny) liquid. -RZ 
The Curiosity rover does not have life detection instruments. It would look for confirmation that liquid water was present and how long during the day it was liquid. -RZ 
It's possible. We know of forms of life that hibernate during dry seasons on Earth. The water that we're seeing within the RSL (the seasonal dark streaks that we're seeing on slopes on Mars) is salty. Salty water could be harmful to life.  We don't know what Earth life could do to any potential life on other worlds. That's why we try to clean our spacecraft very carefully. -- LT 
New impact craters on Mars sometimes have bright ice exposed in the bottom of the crater. This goes away over a few months. The ice, when exposed, is going from solid to vapor. Evaporation of a briny flow will also occur, so the water needs to be resupplied. We don't know how. -RZ 
Information flows to the public very quickly. If one of our missions here at JPL detected life, we'd notify NASA headquarters immediately, who would then follow procedures to notify the US government and the public. -- SLS 
There are no confirmed brine flows (RSL) near Curiosity nor Opportunity. There are in Gale Crater some interesting slope streaks but they are several km away from the Curiosity's present path. -RZ 
Write to your congresspersons. Call them. Bother the hell out of them. Legislative controls the budget.  
We don't know where the water in these hydrated salts come from.  That is the next mystery to solve!   They leading hypotheses are that (1) the salts are sucking up the water from the atmosphere, but you are correct, there isn't much water in the atmosphere, and (2) that the water is coming from the subsurface.  There is certainly more to learn!  --LT 
The ice caps freeze and sublime (solid to vapor.) The RSL water stays liquid because it has salts in it. Yes, we know there's water on Mars. We're looking for where it stays liquid for an extended period of time. -RZ 
MRO has been taking data at Mars since March 2006, nearly 10 years.  The HIRISE instrument (high-resolution imager) has currently taken images of only about 2.4% of the surface.  --LT 
There is a hydrologic cycle on Mars, but typically it involves vapor going to ice (frost) or ice going to vapor. There is no rain in Mars today, but there may have been very early in its history. -RZ 
Shoot them up to an orbital storage facility using lightweight rocket drones, then package them for transfer to Earth orbit where they can be collected and deorbited or taken to the ISS.  Source: I play lots of Kerbal Space Program. 
The salts in the water appear to be perchlorates, so I wouldn't want to drink the water. To be a future resource for humans, you would want to remove the salts. -RZ 
That's such a great question.  Thanks for asking it. 
It would be salty, but considering that perchlorate is toxic to humans,  you wouldn't want to drink it. -- SLS 
This is super exciting!  It is an important discovery because it is evidence that supports our hypothesis that the RSL (seasonal dark streaks that appear to flow in the warm season) are flowing briny (salty) water.  --LT 
We have a policy for Planetary Protection.  This policy means that we clean our spacecraft of earth microbes to varying degrees depending on where the spacecraft is being sent.  It the intended location is thought to have a high possibility of harboring microbes, then we go to the maximum extent to clean the spacecraft. --LT 
They were waiting for the release of the movie "The Martian" to maximize interest. 
The features that darken and fade as temperatures get warmer and then colder are long but narrow. The difficulty was to get enough resolution from our orbiter instruments to first detect, and then characterize what these features are. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) can do that with its HiRISE camera and CRISM Mineral Mapper. -RZ 
Mars had liquid water on its surface billions of years ago. Where that water went is the subject of our current investigations. Was it lost to space? Or is it frozen in the crust today? Mars seems to have ice ages when water at the poles is sublimated and redistributed to the rest of the planet. Ice in the crust today may have been formed during one of those ice age cycles. -RZ 
No.  The 2016 NASA Mars mission, InSight, will put a seismometer on Mars to measure Mars-quakes.  --LT 
Liquid water, even if very salty, is still a good place to look for life forms. We don't know how robust martian life (if it exists) could be. Also, water in any form is a resource that future missions could exploit. -RZ 
MRO has been in orbit for 10 years and has mapped ~2.4 percent of Mars in high-res. We have six-meter-per-pixel imagery of more than 90 percent of the surface. -- LT 
Not quite rainbows, because there is no rain, but we have seen icebows with the Pathfinder mission. -- RZ 
If the atmospheric pressure on Mars was the same as on Earth, then conditions are warm enough that water could be liquid on many places. The atmospheric pressure may have been greater in the past when the Mars channels were formed. -RZ 
The signature that was seen by the MRO CRISM experiment was hydrated perchlorates.   This means that water (H2O) was involved. --LT 
The RSL are a surprise because they appear to flow seasonally and the best hypothesis is due to liquid, briny water.  Mars can get barely above freezing for short periods above time.  The RSL are not though to be due to glaciers because where they are seen (equatorial and mid-latitude regions) we do not see glaciers.  --LT 
If you pour pure water on the surface (depending on the time of day) it will either freeze or boil away into the atmosphere. The salts that were talked about in the press release today would keep the water liquid at much lower temperatures. Remember that the temperatures on Mars change by more than 100 degrees Celsius every day. -RZ 
Discovering the RSL (seasonal dark slope streaks) took having an orbiter (MRO) observing over multiple Mars years.  Then, we had to form the hypothesis, and then go test it, by taking observations with the CRISM spectrometer.  The features are small (4-5 m in width, and 200-300 m length) and only when there are many RSL together can it fill enough of the CRISM pixel to get the signal.  --LT 
At the North pole there is a polar tap made of water ice, which is a mile thick and several hundred km across. Todays story was focused on liquid (briny) water closer to the equator. -RZ 
You are absolutely not a liar. I use the subway all the time and in London, the Underground. Broadway-Lafayette is one of my favorite stations!!!!!!!!! 
Nothing I do is accidentally funny. It is all pre-meditated and carefully planned and scheduled. And if you steal one of my funny ideas, I WILL sue you.  
Yes! Deep-sea diving and mountaineering. There's something about going up and down that turns me on.  
Frakes with a beard, preferable, because it tickles when you kiss him.  
My question would be: Prove to me you're William Shakespeare. 
I'm not sure I've ever been to Petworth. But as it's near Chichester where I have worked, you could be right and I've forgotten. Not surprising. I can't remember breakfast time.  
Well the great man Sigmund Freud said the most important things for a happy and long life were love and work and I've had a cornucopia of both.  
Sithee, hearing my accent is like suppin' ot lead.  
Then Daniel should do it wherever and whenever he can. But I warn him, he could get hooked and wave goodbye to a lovely film career.  
A Sonia Delaunay painting, which I would present to my wife for our imminent second wedding anniversary.  
I have done, but many decades ago. I'm afraid it is too labour intensive for the present state of my career. Maybe once I'm in retirement...perish the thought.  
Don't be silly, I couldn't see my head. It was decapitated! 
Easy. Yorkshire Gold. Any other kind of tea bag needs two bags. By the way, did you know that I am the man who introduced the concept of the double tea bag to the United States. Don't you think that deserves some recognition...A Medal of Honor? And invitation to the White House? Or my own seat on the next space shuttle? 
Because the invitation came from Seth MacFarlane and the writing and head of the creative team was executive producer and showrunner Jonathan Ames. Both brilliant and Walter's colorful character is a delicious creation of Ames.  
Actually, it's Alan Cumming.   Deputy Director Avery Bullock on American Dad is my favorite role to voice act.  
Deputy Director, how did an Englishman come to work for the CIA and is it a good idea? And why haven't the other agents commented on the fact that you are English? Maybe they haven't noticed, in which case they're not smart enough to work for the CIA.  
Easy. First season of Blunt Talk. For the 12 weeks of shooting, I remember nothing except laughing, which is a nice way to get through a working day, especially if it's 14 hours. Everyone in our cast is a comedian (or comedienne). They're funny on screen and they're funny off, which accounts for my comment about laughing. There's not much laughter when you're performing King Lear or Macbeth.  
You're a lucky man to be playing Henry V. I played it in Manchester, England in 1963. How many of you saw it?  If you're transitioning from film to stage, there's only one piece of advice: find a great voice coach.  
I'm sorry to say that you missed only one of the two occasions I have appeared on stage with Dame Judi. The other one was the farewell to the old auditorium in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre by dozens of actors, who had made that stage their home. This time, next year, Ian McKellen and I will be in rehearsals in London for Harold Pinter's great play, No Man's Land.  
My father retired from the military as Regimental Sergeant Major of the British Parachute Regiment. He jumped into action three times. I don't care for the action part of it, but I would love to experience what he did of jumping and parachuting safely to the ground.   
Great costumes in every film, but I loved my superhero costume and my flying chair in Days of Future Past. The chair actually levitated, but only a few inches.  
I wish, but my experience of working with Adrian Scarborough, who plays my valet Harry in Blunt Talk, has spoiled me for anyone else no matter how good a job they might do. Adrian Scarborough is brilliant in Blunt Talk.  
I, too, would LOVE to see Sir Patrick guest on Tabletop. There are plenty of Shakespeare-themed card/board games out there... 
There will be too... At some point in the distant future, if/when we unlock warp travel (and it's theoretically possible), the first ship, **must** be called enterprise, it would be a crime against humanity not to.  
I can't remember if it was ever said in the show, but I believe the explanation is that the French accent is dead by that time.  
I'm gonna throw out a guess and say fridge nuke from Crystal Skull. It just seems so perfect. 
We aren't in any of KG&T's show. I really hope they're successful as all getout. Can't wait to watch it. 
I love live shows. I love touring and I love interacting with a live audience. There's stuff that happens in a room with people around that is genuinely electric. Jamie was done touring at the end of 2015, and Michael Stevens and I were mutual fans and started discussing it and it seemed like a natural. Magician Michael Weber, an incredible magic designer and writer is our director.  
Alton is the best. He's hilarious. He's just as funny as you want and a bit darker.  
Great question! Everyone should have a multi tool. Everyone should have something akin to the iFixit bit kit (to be able to take apart anything).  Tools that are shit until you spend $: Air powered rivet gun. Don't waste your time on the $30.00 one.  Spot Welder.  Nippers: go ahead and invest in a set of Knipex nippers, the last pair you'll ever need. 
That's THE question! The best way is to show them obsessive builds by others. Wake that part of the brain up that says "I've always wanted X, maybe I could make it MYSELF!".  Also- sharing the build log/methods goes a long way to helping people understand that it's not beyond them to problem-solve. 
I also can't get enough of Justin Timberlake's song "Mirrors".  Such good pop!! My kids make fun of me and say I have the musical taste of a 14 year old girl. I'm ok with that.  
Go though all your formulas.  They say they'll provide all of the formulas,but they never do 
I've started tweeting myths I wish I could have gotten to. Under the hashtag #mythsiwouldstillliketotest. Like the roomba that went over someone's dog's poop and covered THE WHOLE HOUSE WITH A POOPOCALYPSE. We would totally have tested which type of stool would yield the worst scenario. Also cat vomit. 
I haven't yet, but I love their work. Hoping to do something with them some day.  
CARDBOARD! You can make literally anything out of cardboard. Ask them their ideal costume and help them make it so! 
I have a whole wall of uncompleted projects. That's the nature of things. It's ok. I get to everything eventually. My Alien space suit took 10 years.  
Actually that's not entirely Adam's quote. He just popularized it through Mythbusters.

Favorite burger is a Jardiniere in San Francisco (the owner, Traci Des Jardins is a friend so clear conflict of interest on my part) and lately she's been serving the Impossible Burger (all plant proteins!) which is INSANELY DELICIOUS. Serious. They serve it at the bar. Go try one. 
Yes. Sigh. Reddit, like the web in general, is a mix of the high and low, the good and bad. When it's bad it feels like middle school at it's worst.  I think the general tone of discourse on the reddit that I see is getting better rather than worse. That keeps me coming. I also spent lots of time on Metafilter as a salve to reddit's baser instincts. Seriously who makes fun of a 13 year old girl? Remember being 13? It sucked ass for all of us. Why make it worse? 
This is the best.  Homeland security is on it's way.  
Yeah, that happens. The balance between work and home and family is really tough. It gets easier when the kids get older to be sure. For me, sample size of 1, I find it works best when I don't think of the shop as "stealing time". The consciousness around the shop work is vital to maintaining the balance.  
You're right, but I like saying that I'm unemployed.  
Well, the first step is was to understand that it's just part of the mechanism. That is: that feeling shitty about doing what I do will occur from time to time but doesn't define me. Then it's about pushing past the lack of desire to do anything about it.   How does one do THAT? For me with any project there's a list of, let's say, 10 things at any given point I know should happen. When I'm feeling really down that might descend to only one thing. Or even half a thing. That is: I can't really see how to proceed and my usual intuition is in the toilet. So I gingerly proceed with that half-a-thing until things start to normalize. Or I go home and recoup and just be ok with not feeling awesome. That's ok too. It's a huge question you're actually asking and it's somewhat of a disservice for me to try and answer in a couple of paragraphs but that's what works for me. Hope it helps.  
I just figured out how I want to do the Adam Savage Book Club and details will be coming soon!! 
One of my all-time favorite movies is The Philadelphia Story. 
It's a battle between present me and future me. Present me would like to go home without sweeping up. Future me knows that he'll thank past me for cleaning up and leaving the shop ready for the next morning. It's an ongoing conversation. I also LOVE organizing. I spend at least an hour a day doing it. even in my house if not in my shop.  
IIRC They've had to cancel a myth about homemade explosives because it was **too** potent. And I think they ended up alerting the FBI who may have already known. 
A two hour bombastic variety show using all the tools of the theater and stage magic to illustrate cool science, hosted by a pair of better-than-average explainers. With craptons of audience participation. I can't WAIT to hit the road. We're writing it right now and it's awesome. (braincandylive.com) 
Oh yes. first job I wanted was to design for Lego. I was 8 
I'm very interested in Augmented Reality. I have watched Black Mirror. it's hit and miss for me. Uneven acting, writing, but when it's good (season 3 ep 1) it's destabilizingly good.  
Listening to a lot of the Milk Carton Kids and Decemberists. Also Sara Bareilles.  
It's insane. We could shoot 200 more videos. Peter's the best. Hopefully I'll return before too long. 
Probably when he had to bust a duct tape myth. I mean... who would have thought that duct tape isn't good for EVERYTHING? 
Always the broader skill set makes you more employable in the long run. Costume is great. Theater is where to get lots of experience in costuming.  
Yeah that's a tricky one. I don't want to open TOO much of my life to the outside. I try and keep a balance between the public private parts of myself.   
Don't worry about that at all! Happy to do it. Being in the public eye has afforded me a very nice existence so far. I'm happy to take pictures with people.   
Good design is always about communication. It's about telling the right story at the right time. When you head towards a door and you can't tell immediately whether to push or pull it, that's BAD design. That's something that the wonderful book The Design of Everyday Things taught me. I agree with you. I learned graphic design just before computers and have noted that the same rules still apply even though the medium and methods of execution have radically changed. 
We don't have to be partisan to understand that we OWN the things we buy and should be able to modify them. Promote that idea. Live that idea. Improve your toys and share what you've done.  
Norm and Danica's puppy Ripley is the cute singularity. 
Good sewing machines have never been cheaper. 300 bucks buys you a machine capable of sewing heavy leather. (mine is a Janome fyi) 
I love pepakura but I haven't tried it yet. I love the IM cardboard and foam builds.  
Yes, of course! I LOVE Michael! Please say hello to him for me! 
I like to do AMAs every few months. I never do them same-day -- usually a few days ahead when I see I have some time. Even Jamie always liked the AMAs.  
I write a vey complete chapter-by-chapter outline of every book before I start writing. 
Don't get scared, but it's time for me to leave. Thank you, everyone, for the great questions. I hope you enjoy the Hunting Hour marathon on Discovery Family Channel. And I hope you have a scary Halloween. Bye for now. 
I was really happy with the GB Movie. I'm so glad they're talking about doing a sequel. 
God, that's probably Jontrons greatest video to date.   Memorable quotes from the video   "FBI should be knocking this door down any minute"  "CANT A GUY GET SOME *PRIVACY*?? HMM HMM HM HM HMM"  Larry- I had to check to see if there was hair growing anywhere else  Jon- No no no, no no   Larry- none on my chest  Jon- please Larry  Larry- None on my back  Jon- you don't know what you're doing   Larry- and now...   Jon- STOP    
I love the R.L. Grime mixes. Of course I listen to them. 
All of my stories start with a title. The title leads me to the story. 
I'm a big Stephen King fan. I think he's a terrific storyteller. I also like Peter Straub. 
I was very happy with the movie. I think it could have been a TINY bit scarier. But I truly loved the way it came out. 
I'm always reminded of R. L. Stine when I watch Wheel of Fortune. It's fun for me.  
This was my favorite part of Goosebumps!  I would tag the decision page and then go down one path, and then go back to the decision and do the other!   Seriously, R. L. Stine made reading so much fun. Between him and J.K. Rowling, I became a lifetime reader. 
Working with the puppeteers was the most fun a writer could have. Did you know that I modeled Batly the Bat after my son Matt? 
The words Monster Blood just popped into my head. Then I had to figure out what it was. 
I'm working on a new GB series for next year. It's called Goosebumps SlappyWorld. The first book is called Slappy Birthday to You. 
Jellyjam from Camp Jellyjam. He smelled so bad, he died of his own odor. 
I don't get much sleep at Halloween time. I'm out publicizing my Discovery Family Channel marathon that starts in a few hours. And my newest GB book, The Lizard of Oz. 
Searched your name. First book result. "Gay T-Rex Law Firm". Ok.   Edit - Next result. "Space Raptor Butt Invasion" 
I always wish I had done something differently, but I seldom look back at books. Gotta move on to the next one. By the way, the new Fear Street book is called The Dead Boyfriend. I'm enjoying writing Fear Street again. And watch for a Fear Street movie next year! 
I don't miss the series because they're still being shown. Discovery Family Channel will be showing The Haunting Hour all of November. 
These are the real questions right here.  I will never forget how blown away I was hearing "*listeners* beware, you choose the scare!" on the 2013 mix. 
He's not responding to you this time either. Don't be sad, he didn't answer me either.  :( 
Me too!  I remember feeling like I was so grown up when I started reading this series. 
You're adorable and I hope you get to meet R.L. Stine one day! 
He accused me of using up all of the amusement park plots in the world. 
The only message in my books is RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! 
The Scholastic Book catalog struggle was so REAL haha 
Not close at all. He played me as Orson Welles! Hilarious. 
Welcome to Dead House.  It would fit the zombie craze today. 
The mission of the Commission on Debates is to educate people about the presidential election. 76% of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates. End of argument. 
Shedding the social conservative dogma of the Republican Party.  (On behalf of Gov. Weld, he feels the same way.) 
No, we would initially target a 20% reduction in those bases. 
I do believe that marijuana should be legalized, and I do believe California will legalize it in November, which will be a tipping point.  An example of a black market in marijuana is Washington state where a black market still survives due to too many taxes. 
Honesty, transparency, not a hypocrite (not saying one thing and doing another). 
The best way to reduce health care costs is to get more competition into the system. This means health savings accounts, this means not requiring everyone to buy a cradle-to-grave policy, but instead they could buy a catastrophic-injury policy and after that negotiate with individual vendors. 
I would be Jon Snow.  My favorite Game of Thrones scene is Jon Snow, holding his sword, ready to be slain, only to survive. 
Count on my support for majority vote.  Count on my support for ranked voting.  I believe it would have to be done via an amendment to the Constitution. 
This needs to be so much higher. Native rights and politics is shameful right now, as it always has been.   To put it in perspectiv in terms of social awareness and activism, there are far more Native Americans in this country than there are homosexuals (no, I'm not arguing that a race is a sexual orientation). If they had half the political capital of a much smaller group, then maybe we wouldn't see starvation on the Rez at 2x-3x the national average. 
We could have Abe Lincoln from balanced rebellion be moderator! Lol 
I'm obviously not /u/GovGaryJohnson, but look for a Libertarian Party press release on kratom very soon. 
If they don't get into the initial debate, they still need to try to get into the second and third ones. Being in a different debate can apparently disqualify you from the official ones, so they need to be careful about this.  However I'm sure they'll do everything they can to be use any medium they can 
Vet here.   He suggests starting with implementing the BRAC findings that the Pentagon supports. 20% of foreign bases.   Further, a non-interventionalist foreign policy, and pulling out of Afghanistan immediately.   The impression i get from him is that he wants to cut where it's smart, and spend what's really important. So let's buy F-18 Hornet parts so we can fly, but let's not spend money on tanks we don't want or need. Europe has been able to cut their military significantly and spend on welfare programs because they've relied on our military to protect them. It's time for them to protect themselves, or we're going to go bankrupt as a country. 
Johnson supporter here.   I've been campigning for him since about 2010. Back then, noone knew him (mostly)...now I get 2-5 comments a day on my shirt or my bumper sticker.   If someone complains about "I hate Hillary and Trump", tell them there is a viable 3rd option and have them google Gary Johnson.   Like he said in the AMA earier, you may not agree with him 100%, but at least he is transparent and honest. 
Really wish he could answer this. If he could sway me on this, I'd feel much more comfortable voting for him. 
I believe I remember him saying positive things about nuclear, but the public would be too scared 
They have mentioned that they wouldn't keep separate staffs. 
The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension 
The best way to reduce health care costs is to get more competition into the system. This means health savings accounts, this means not requiring everyone to buy a cradle-to-grave policy, but instead they could buy a catastrophic-injury policy and after that negotiate with individual vendors. 
I would be shocked if they supported banning it. My guess is the silence is due to it being a new issue and they don't want to say something without further research 
If I were to guess it's a contractual obligation.  Sony paid a network to run a certain number of commercials, and the Network still wishes to receive money but they don't want to keep the ad spread out over the next few weeks.  Just my best guess 
Straight to torrent is more likely. Who buys dvd's? 
Their moms said they're not allowed to use the computer anymore after that whole 'fappening' thing. 
Then they'll threaten the cable compa...   ...hey, wait, maybe that's not such a bad idea.  
Agreed.  I find this very confusing.  Hasnt NK threatened nuclear war like every other month to SK and friends? 
Wait a second.... The Koreans are going to attack our proposed lunch date for next thursday? Dont bomb our NOM! 
This is the start of a new genre of filmmaking: suicidal-modernism 
Team America was lampooning American arrogance as well, and Kim Jon Il was a huge film buff and would have understood that.   Hell, the major thing they mocked about him was the Korean dialect.   The Interview is supposed to be pretty damning of the North Korean regime according to an NPR story I was listening to earlier.  
Offer it for free to just one theater chain... Let the other choke on the popcorn dust 
It's like Hostess going under only to make "The Sweetest Comeback in the History of Ever!" except... "The Movie You Could Have DIED Seeing Is Now Back From The Dead!" 
Don't worry...you'll still be able to watch this right after they've finished soaking up every last drop of pure unadulterated free publicity that this whole stunt has to offer. 
That would be hilarious if they did a shitty dub, in just one scene maybe, to make fun of all this and instead of his real name they dub Kim Bong Uh and North Candyland. I could imagine Seth dubbing it in a high pitched voice. If they did it once it would be funny, otherwise it would get old. 
gee willickers, $5 for bringing in some of the most famous actors in the world to do an AMA 
Of course! We'll just defeat North Korea with memes! If only we'd though of it sooner! 
how easy?  i've seen estimates that the damage might be up to $100 million.  Then theater chains started getting cyber and physical attacks and backed out.  They could have allowed some theaters to run it, but it would have a horrible opening weekend, and then there's the danger of those theater chains being attacked too.  Why would AMC or Regal risk this kind of crippling cyber attack over a movie? 
Release it as a post credit scene to the next spiderman 
Kim Jong In is vastly less secure than his father and is thus less able to accept satire like this. 
If they don't want anyone to talk about it, they won't let it get to the lawsuit stage. They'll pay everyone to shut up about it.  
they got supported, they were paid to make the film. they have free speech. The government didn't stop the film from being shown. Instead the company that paid them to create the film for them has decided to not show it.   
No, but they could still attack movie theatres as a statement about the film being released. Either way people die.  Having said that, I think they should release the film. Hell, I'll even go and watch it on opening day and see if I get blown up.  I say that for two reasons. First, North Korea has always been nothing but empty threats. Second, if it takes a terrorist act for the US to finally move and bring freedom to the North Koreans, a country that ACTUALLY FUCKING NEEDS freedom then let's bring this shit on. 
If this was found out to be true I would be turned off seeing it if anything.   
Hell they don't even need to release it for free, I'd pay $5 to rent it. 
I have watched most of them. I don't find it difficult to watch because I went through it. I've seen it all. I still remember a friend of mine who was hanged because he was using a telephone wire as a belt to hold up his pants. They hung him and he fell back down. They put him back up and hung him again. 
They need to tell story as it is. You cannot shy away from history and its brutality. We usually learn about history through books, but this is an event that happened in my lifetime, I witnessed it, and I am still alive today to discuss it. Soon, there will not be any survivors left. I am 92. Once all the survivors are gone, the skeptics will probably come into the picture unfortunately. And that is why we need to educate everyone about what really happened. It didn't happen 500 years ago. It happened in my lifetime. 
I was first sent to Drancy, a transit camp. I was then transported in a cattle car packed with people with no food or water and one bucket in the middle to use as a toilet. I was ~~16~~ 18 at the time.  The smell was unfathomable.   After six days in the train the train came to stop. The guards started to count men. They selected 300 men. I was number 298. We were taken off the train. The train then continued on its way to Auschwitz and everyone was killed. I will never forget the number 298. 
I thought it was as close as you can come. It was very well done. 
I wanted to travel and see the world. I went forwards, not backwards. It was a very difficult transition back into real life. I had 3/4 of my stomach taken out from an infection I got while at the camps. This was painful. 
I used to go out at night risking my life to steal some raw potatoes from the kitchen at Peiskretscham and at Blechhammer. I took chances. At Blechhammer some inmates caught a dog, a German Shepard, and cooked it. It was a feast. Tasted like rabbit. That was the only time I've eaten dog, and it was the best meal I had in a long time. These days I prefer steak. 
I had dysentery in Gross Rosen and I couldn't go to the bathroom for three days. This was when I almost gave up.  
Going back to normal life was difficult. People didn't want to talk about the war and didn't see anything special about surviving the camps. People didn't want to discuss it. 
I asked the american soldier if he knew my brother. My brother had gone to US a few years before and enlisted in the army. 
I cannot forgive. But I was never consumed by hate. Hate doesn't improve anything.  
I got divorced after 49 and a half years of marriage. We still talk to each other once in a while. I now have a girlfriend, and I'm very happy. My ex-wife got remarried shortly after the divorce to a family friend. I never stayed single for too long! My ex-wife was also hidden during the Holocaust with a christian family. 
Everyday you think of living. We are born to die, but I appreciate life. We live day by day, and I always say: yesterday is history, today's reality, and tomorrow's a dream.  
Some people ate too much and got very sick from that. I ate slowly and slowly recovered. It took maybe four to five months to get back to a normalish weight. 
Most people had no idea. Anyone who knew what was going on was already at the gas chamber or in the camps. 
I never had anxiety or depression. I'm lucky I guess. I'm 92 and my health is very good. I go dancing, I travel, and I love life. I'm busy, I'm active, and love sharing my story to schools in Miami and my time at the Holocaust memorial in miami. 
I love sharing my story, but don't even know what reddit is. My grandson has always wanted me to share my story to as many people as possible so he suggested this.  
The soldiers were doing their job, and I cannot recall any compassion from any soldier.  
No. Every survivor has his or her own story. I was interviewed by Spielberg and have that on tape. I think every survivor was interviewed by him to document the living survivors. 
I know there's a research database in the holocaust museum in washington. there's probably some organizations that could help you but i'm not truly sure. good luck! 
There was many times I almost lost hope. It was difficult to get the stamina to keep going. I just hoped I would survive and lived day by day. I returned to Drancy where I was deported from. My name is on a wall in Paris with 76,000 names of people who got deported from there. I don't think many survived. 
I have always believed in god. Before and after. God didn't kill the people, the Nazi's did. 
You cannot deny history. They should be punished someway, but I'm not sure that imprisonment is the right way. But lots of people are ignorant and sometimes there's very little you can do about that. 
I don't remember ever seeing someone passing by. People wear long sleeve shirts so it's usually covered up. I have met other people with numbers at holocaust events in the past though. 
The secret is to enjoy whatever you do in my life. Think positive. I'm also very lucky to be in the shape I am and I still have my mind.  
I think OP hasn't gone this far into the thread. I just want to tell you, as a Jew whose family suffered in the Holocaust: you're not responsible. Don't blame yourself. You weren't even born then.  I have German friends. I know of many Jews who live in Germany now. If we have reached this state, I think, we can assume that Germany has handled this as well as possible.  You, personally, have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of regarding the Holocaust. Blaming the offspring is ridiculous. 
I cannot take back anything, and I cannot regret anything. We were treated worse than animals. My name was 177153. 
I honestly didn't comprehend it when I was liberated. I was very sick at the time. I stayed in a house for two weeks and then i went back to Belgium. Somebody gave me clothes to wear and that's all i had. 
I never planned an escape. There were electric fences and you were wearing uniforms. I never witnessed any possible escapes. 
To teach everyone what the Holocaust was and to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself.   I didn't personally learn anything from the Holocaust. We have one life to live and you have to enjoy it. There is no room for hate in this world.  
I've been to her house in Amsterdam, but I actually have never read her diary. Every survivor (and even non-survivor in the case of Anne Frank) has a different story. Every story needs to be shared. 
I really didn't understand it. I was confused. I didn't know I was free. 
My brother was very relieved to know that I made it out alive. My parents and sister and her child were all sent to Auschwitz. It would have been tough on him to know that his entire family was killed. But that was the reality many people faced.  
I was captured in France. While trying to buy grapes at a market. They asked for my papers and that was it. 
I never saw signs of regret. I cannot recall ever seeing or knowing any "normal" soldiers.  
That dictatorships are not good. They fulfill the dream of one person. And unfortunately they are still in existence today. 
I have never met a former Nazi.   The only habit that stayed with me is my desire to live. 
I do not remember seeing these. I'm sure they were there, but some things stick out in my memory more than others. 
If you have a desire to live, you will do what it takes to exist for the next day.  
The chances of me recalling someone is very small. Feel free to post it though and I'll take a look. 
I was very young while in Vienna so I don't remember much. My education stopped when I was 14. I'm self educated. I know five languages- English, French, German, Yiddush, and some Hebrew. 
Thank you for your time Sir, it's an honor to be able to ask you questions.  
I think it's wonderful if you date Jewish women, but that is not necessary. In my opinion, it is necessary in life to be happy. I can't really agree with her statement because if that involves you marrying someone that you're not happy with then it's not worth it. 
Bad things are happening all over the world today. I think humans are capable of terrible things. To me, I think it's possible for something like this to happen again in the future, but not at the same scale. I think without Israel, it could happen again.  
I cannot recall coming across any black jews.   I tell them we were just a number, not human beings. We were not called by names, just by our numbers.  
I would not accept that. I am absolutely against it. I would find it very distasteful. 
Depends on the age, but you have to explain slowly. It's very difficult to understand. 
It's hard to remember. I'm sure there was, but I cannot recall. 
You cannot tell me it didn't happen. I went through it. I have never met anyone who has denied that it happened. If I did, it would be apparent that they're not educated, or extremely ignorant, or both.  
The sad thing is, those stories might be so popular because they were so rare and flew in the face of everything that was normal or standard at the time. 
For iOS pick up (1) book on learning Swift; (2) Big Nerd Ranch book on making "practice" apps with Swift. For Android pick up (1) book on learning Java; and (2) Big Nerd Ranch book on making "practice" apps with Java.  With those four books, you should have a very strong foundation for getting out to sites like StackOverflow.com and advancing from there. 
I've found that most people who say tabs think you mean actually using the space bar instead of the tab key lol.  
Thank you. I'm very suspicious of new developers. I'm afraid they're incapable of working in larger collaboration. 
Definitely StackOverflow. I haven't used Code Academy but have heard really good things about it. For me it was a few good books and a very large dose of SO. 
This is a very tricky subject. Basically the issue was solved by letting the owner of the hockey team in on the software startup. 
We didn't invest a single dollar. It was all contributions of time, way way too much free time. 
Considering our initial investment was $0, the ROI has been infinite. 
Economics degree from Northwestern. I have always been really introverted but had a love of learning, so I finished up high school and moved out at 16, and was probably very lucky that Northwestern chose to let me in at that age. 
If I were you, and past that BNR point, I would just start coding projects and start looking to build a reputation or earn some additional income. Maybe look into freelance (some of those freelance mobile developers really rake it in) or try to build a reputation on GitHub. StackOverflow is the only resource material I've really needed following those first four books. There is just so much info on SO, if it goes down the internet is history. 
And where will you keep them all up here in the Hollywood hills? 
I am 23. If you ever feel like you can't do it, do what I do and head over to r/CrappyDesign. If some of those guys are professional programmers why can't I be? 
Actually, not yet! Have received a lot of spam though. 
Clemson has been the nicest team to work with. After publishing their app, they sent me a signed thank you card and a bobble head. Class act all the way. 
It's definitely a full-time effort. I'd say learning to code was a hobby, but programming has been a job. 
Yes, at the time there were no reputable books on Swift, so I learned Objective-C for iOS and Java for Android. I also picked up some basic PHP for backend server-side stuff. 
Thanks, this is my absolute favorite thing to hear. Glad you enjoyed the product! 
Code Academy is free and is a good tool for learning HTML/CSS among other things. I would check that out first 
I wish I made the NBA official app. I've made some apps for NBA teams, though. Some of this has been one-off apps, like the app we did for the Atlanta Hawks last year, and others have been integrated into the team's official app in SDK format, like we did for the NHL Florida Panthers last season as well. 
All the bureaucracy and contracts. Seriously, screw that I just want to code. 
reddit has a lot of cash. Monetization isn't a short-term concern of ours. Yes, we will continue to experiment with different efforts so that when time is right we know what works and what does not.   
The first time I was asked was way back when Yishan left. At the time I was too focused on Hipmunk to seriously consider it. Since then, Hipmunk has grown into a really nice, stable company-- we've hired very well-- and they can move forward without my complete attention (I will still be acting as CTO for the time being).  The past week was super hectic. A week ago, I didn't know I would be here! 
Really good question, thank you.  I think the new user / core user dichotomy is the biggest product challenge we fact right now. Solve it, and we are unstoppable. A vague answer, I know, but this is one of the big things on my mind. 
I have lots of ideas! But, I'm sad to say, I don't want to publicize them here until I've got more support internally. It's shitty if you're on a product/dev team to come into work and find everything's been upended without any of your input. 
Don't forget to crosspost with /r/cannibals. Similar audiences. 
As a Greek I cannot gild your comment because all transactions out of this country are blocked. On top of that we're being made fun of/jumped at on almost every /r/ :(  
Follow up on this one, isn't that policy just a way to avoid people appealing bans? If they don't know they were banned or why, how can they complain? Even 4chan at its banniest told you you were banned and why. 
We will reconsider all our policies from first principles. I don't know all of the changes that were made under Ellen's tenure. I'm mostly still getting to know everyone here.  No, Ellen was not used as a scapegoat. She stepped up during a time of crisis for reddit, for which we were thankful. Things didn't go smoothly, for sure, but I will do my best to guide us forward. 
Too soon to tell. I've only got to meet the team for the first time late in the afternoon, and I still haven't had a chance to meet everyone, let alone have substantive discussions.  The vibe around the office is pretty fun, but the reddit team has been through a lot the past while. I hope I can bring some stability. 
It's going to take a little time to find the right balance. Hipmunk is in a stable place, and most of my value is provided in a few key meetings every week, which I will still be attending. Also, they're five blocks away, so I can go over there whenever I need. 
For those not aware, /r/AMD was closed down by the top mod abruptly without any warning. This forced users of that subreddit to move to /r/AdvancedMicroDevices.  As for a potential answer if spez doesn't reply....reddit hasn't intervened in subreddit's closing down and such when a mod does it on their own. If the AMD mod had done something fishy then it could be opened (like /r/wow was). 
/u/spez was his second choice behind /u/kn0thing , he was just so sad that he missed that username. 
Is Reddit Gifts gone? I'm pretty sure it is not, and we have no plans to shut it down.  As for Dan, I didn't work with him, and really don't know much of that situation.   
reddit had better technology than Digg. I don't think Voat has better technology than reddit. 
Yeah, I think monthly would work better. People would just get bored with them if it were too often. I could see him doing it bi-weekly for the first month or two, since there are probably going to be a lot of changes and questions in that time. 
No. I know she was well-loved by many moderators, and I'm very sorry at how everything played out. It could have been handled much better.  However, she was let go for specific reasons, which I obviously will not share, and we will stand by that decision.  What we will absolutely do is make sure we have dedicate people internally to help manage the relationships between moderators and guests on reddit. I'm still getting to know everyone here, and I expect this will be an ongoing conversation between you all and I. 
I think we need more official Reddit Android Developers. 
Yes, we have an amazing opportunity to change the world.  No, I just didn't want to look stupid in front of my parents. 
I was just over there, in fact! It's well decorated for sure.  I was born in Michigan. I ran the Crim race in Flight years ago. 
they just got a huge influx of people, thanks to our CEO. 
I'm never going to live down spelling 'renown' wrong. 
1000 duck sized horses. Since they can't climb stairs, you can easily get away from them long enough to figure out how to drown them. 
We had a really good laugh when we found out that Mossack Fonseca addressed some of his very secretive clients by code names like "Winnie Pooh" or "Harry Potter".   Sth like that: *"I refer to a meeting with Harry Potter"*  Hilarious!  
Of course we were and still are worried. But we know that Germany is a pretty safe country for journalists. We are more concerned about our colleagues in other regions of the world, like Russia, Africa, Latin America... 
We think the most important stories of the leak got the attention they deserved. At least as far as we can see. But of course we can't overlook all the published stories in nearly 80 countries. Do you think there is a story that the media should have reported more on?  
We tried to be vague. And we tried to make our work sound as boring as possible, so that no one wants to ask anymore questions. It worked most of the time.  
We were thrilled and skeptical at the same time. But we were able to verify the parts of the data we reported on through various sources, f.e. court documents, public registries, former leaks and in the end also interviews.  
We don't have a clue. But as a former NSA-employer, Snowden certainly has his methods. ;)  
It started with just the two of us, Bastian and Frederik. In May 2015 we were around 40 people worldwide and at the end of the year almost 400 people. And these were only the people who worked with the data itself. Each news outlet had a lot more staff that was working on different aspects of the story - like design, publishing or reporting on the ground, researching different aspects. *(Bastian and Frederik)* 
Happy cake day!  And no, we are not really worried about our future careers. Is there any reason we should? Is there anything we don't know??? If yes, please tell us! 
There already is a book! It's only available in German right now tough 
On The Media has a good episode about the Panama Paper which also explained this. 
We dont want to speculate. But obviously the source wanted the data to be handled by journalists.  
Learn data journalism and combine it with investigative skills.   **Data journalists get hired.** (for a reason) 
We got over eleven million documents with thousands of stories in it. Why would someone leak this huge amount of data if he wants only a certain story to be published? He couldnt even be sure we would find this particular story! 
Great question! This is the biggest downside of the project: We will never be done. Ever!   Seriously, we don't know what stories are still in the data-set. We will continue to use the data-set, for example when some people are becoming of public interest that haven't been before.    
No, because they didn't know about it beforehand. At least we hope that's the case.   We have been contacted afterwards but we do not cooperate with Intelligence Agencies.  
We are not giving out any documents to any authorities. But we published and are going to publish certain documents to proof our stories. 
We had a secure forum to share findings and discuss them. We also met up a couple of times, in Washington, Munich, Lillehammer, Johannesburg and London. These meetings were really important to build up the trust we needed to work together so closely.   These meetings were also great, cause we were not able to talk about our work with anyone else. Finally someone to talk to!  To coordinate the work, we set up project groups who were focusing on certain aspects of the Panama Papers. Like Fifa or Russia.   We communicated a lot with each other, also via encrypted E-Mails or chats.  
Yes, we worked with **ARIJ - arab reporters for investigative journalism.**   They are great!   At the moment we are planning a story about the involvement of Middle East Leaders, btw. 
There are countries we found more cases in than in others. Often this is correlated to the corruption index: There are countries with more corruption and shell companies are a typical instrument to hide such dubious activities. But if you look at Malta, Great Britain or Iceland you can see that also Western governments are struggling a lot with the revelations of the Panama Papers.   
The ICIJ will release a public database in May. It won't be the 2.6 TB of documents, but they will publish a list with companies, shareholders and clients. (Vanessa) 
We don't work together with Intelligence Agencies. Ever.  
Thank you, we really appreciate it!  We were really relieved and happy that everything worked out as planned and nothing leaked before. We were fascinated by the reactions and the momentum it created. The PP-landing page made it to the front page of Reddit in a couple of hours, that was amazing! As well as the subreddit you guys created.   Our families finally understood the strange way we acted in the months prior: Why we worked so much and had to be so secretive about everything. They were really surprised about how huge this project was.   
We had a wall in our research room where we collected all the leads to bigger names and public personas. Each morning we met in front of that wall and it reminded us how important our work is. That was a pretty good motivation.  
That depends on the movie and who would play me. *(Bastian)* 
More examples yes:   Oktoberfest, Azkaban, Bruni, Fighter, Father, Son, Daughter....    Real names? No.  
It's a leak from an anonymous, unidentified source. Who knows what might be missing from the data set.   Stories about big names aren't going to disappear if 400 journalists have access to every document. There's way too much prestige/exposure to gain from it. 
He answered it higher up. Americans likely prefer different tax havens than Panama. 
Never. I think it's my duty as a guest to always accept when my host is offering a good thing. When people are expressing themselves by what they offer, I feel it's my duty to if necessary take one for the team. It's what I call a "grandma rule"; I may not like grandma's turkey, but I'm in grandma's house, I'm gonna eat it. And I'm gonna smile and say I like it. I think that's just good manners.   If you treat me like an idiot though and serve me crap with utter contempt. I can spiral into a serious depression for days and I will not be nice about it. This means you, Johnny Rockets. 
You know the show I haven't been able to make yet, I'd like to do a show with Keith Richards. I'm working on it.  He's an enthusiast and a voracious reader.  He's very interested in British naval history. Maybe visiting the site of great British naval battles with Keith Richards, eat bangers and mash, cooking steak and pie together would be really fun That's something I'd really love to do.  
It's a tough question. I used to think Vietnam for a long time but lately... I'm leaning very much toward Italy! I like it there! I like the food. All those carbs are dangerous but Italy's a pretty nice place. 
Yeah, I don't know that I translate well on television at all. I don't know, and to be honest, I kinda don't really take myself that seriously, so I don't really care. I mean, anytime you put a lens on somebody, it has a distorting and changing effect. But I never really worry about that. I'm very lucky in that I get paid to really be myself; I don't have a script. I decide where we go and what we do on the show. I've gotten away with being obnoxious on TV for 15 years now. I don't really see any reason to chance.   So yeah, I have no complaints. I'm not afraid to look like an idiot on TV; it happens a lot. We don't have hair or makeup, for instance. It would be interesting to show up on a show with like a Trumpian Cheeto tan. Actually, I should try that. 
Oh that's a really good question! You know, these days just about everywhere I go there's some young chef with a lot of tattoos of animals on their arms with their really good charcuterie program, making craft beer somewhere on the premises. So it should really not surprise me.   Nashville, TN; Asheville, NC; Minneapolis, for a very long time had really good food and a lot of great chefs. I think Los Angeles is wildly underrated; it was famous for years and appreciated for its strip mall food, it's Korean and Mexican and Latino food. But man, some of the restaurants that have been opening in the last 10 years are really really good. Everybody knows Seattle and Portland are great.   But yeah, off the top of my head, I'm kinda looking at the South. Charleston, NC, another one. But it's hard to say that these places are underrated. I mean, people are finding out how good they are. There's never been a better time to eat in America, honestly.  
 Yes! Where do I begin? Every day in the DRC--the Democratic Not-So-Democratic Republic of the Congo--there were many tense moments. Libya, post-Benghazi, was again, many concerning moments where we sort of had to take regular meetings among the crew and decide for ourselves whether we would make a run for the airport or continue shooting. Beirut, 2006, got a little dodgy.   And immediately after eating Nashville Hot Chicken, that was truly, truly terrifying. And if you're considering going to Nashville, by the way, please notice that Nashvillians themselves don't eat the extra-hot fried chicken. They know better. Unless you've got three or four days to spend in a bathroom, I really advise against that.  
The Balvenie Doublewood 12-year is my go-to. Can't imagine what the 17-year is like.  
Whoa! What have I made in my life? Wow! You've caused me to reflect on my utterly worthless existence. I mean, I give a cute answer, I assisted in the making of a 9 year old girl. A birdhouse, a chest of drawers, I really wish I could do those things. Everything I ever made with my hand, you know it was food, it literally turned to shit within 8 hours. So...wow...Oh my god! I'm really depressed now! 
I've been trying to get into Afghanistan for years. The insurance company is reluctant to let us shoot there. Yemen, I'd like to go very much but, obviously, that also is a security situation. There are a lot of countries that I haven't been to because of security concerns.   Though I will tell you I would like to overcome my childhood-born phobia of Switzerland at some point. You'll notice I've never done a show there. I have a deep neurotic fear of haunting vistas, you know, like a mural of Lake Geneva with snowcapped peaks and yodelers, or those dogs with the barrels under their neck. I'm frightened of all things Swiss, and I'm trying to overcome that. Working on it, and I hope to do a show there at some point. 
When I first went on TV and I started going on book tours I was a guy who would literally drink anything. Fans would come up to me and offer me shots of tequila and I would actually drink them. I am still here and alive today because I don't do that anymore. If I took every offer of a shot or other substance that fans offer to me, I wouldn't have made it to 2008, much less to this year. So chances are, to be perfectly honest, you wouldn't see me at a bar. If you were to offer me a shot, I would probably politely decline. I know people offer those things with the best intentions but I'm a dad now. I'm the 60 year old dad of a 9 year old. I have to at least try to stay live long enough to get to the eye rolling stage of my daughter's life.  
I did not get to keep the knife. I bid on it online; it was put up for auction. I bid $5,000, but I saw that the lowest bid at the time, or the current high bid was something like $22,000. So needless to say I did not get that knife.   I did, however, finally after a wait of longer than a year, I did get the opportunity to buy a Kramer knife. It is easily my most valued physical object that I own. It is a thing of beauty, and I'm just waiting to find food worthy of it, to use it.  
Twenty dollars?! I don't know. It might be a dirty water hot dog. You know? A bagel, with some butter, or no! A bialy. A toasted bialy with some butter, maybe at like Barney Greengrass, and then...what, do I die after spending this $20? Is that what happens? I mean, it's a pretty good value, maybe I'll have two bialys for $20.  
That was my one and only time at waffle house. It is a strange and exotic wonderland to me.  I really have yet to explore it fully. I was obviously thoroughly taken by it and cannot wait to go back. In fact, I have a secret urge, as a lot of my chef friends do, their secret urge is that they want cook at Waffle House. Just for a day to see if they can hack it because it's a tough gig. No, so I haven't been back, they don't have it in the New York/Tristate area unfortunately. If they did I would be hitting that place hard and often. They're wonderful.  
No, I do it without shame. I'm like super organized, I'm a list maker, and I have a schedule. I'm not one of those people who calls a restaurant at the last minute and says, "Do you know who I am?" I plan ahead. I do make reservations. And I always show up for them.   You know, making multiple reservations in multiple restaurants on the same night at the same time and blowing off the other ones? That's right up there with being rude to your server, as far as restaurant crimes. They should keep a file on such people. In fact, some restaurants do!  
Coolest shit I ever found anywhere? I dunno, I mean the most cool shit per square foot is probably in Tokyo. You know, if you're looking for cool shit, your statistical likelihood of finding some is gonna be in Tokyo.   Wow, what a tough question. Yeah, try Tokyo.  
There was a Rome episode of No Reservations where he refused to reveal the name of a restaurant and thereby referred to it as, "Restaurant X." Of course, though, the internet figured it out. 
 There is no single cure all. I would say the ultimate broke ass, dorm food, for people who don't have a lot of money, for people aren't good at cooking, if you only have a hotplate, is a Korean dish called Budae Jjigae, also known as Army Stew or Korean Army Stew. You can google that shit. It is an unholy mix of ramen, hot dogs (or vienna sausage), spam, beans, kimchi, and Korean spices. I know that sounds like just a horrible train wreck, it's really delicious and you can pretty much train a reasonably intelligent doberman to make it. It's perfect. When there was a lot of poverty and necessity during wartime in Korea, it perfectly reflects the need to improvise, innovate, and make the most of what you have on hand. It remains a delicious and beloved dish in Korea. I adore this stuff.  
I'm not Anthony, of course, but as someone who has cooked in a few restaurants, I can say that it isn't very hard to get a gig washing dishes or even as a prep cook, and rapidly work your way up to line cook. Real professional experience is valuable to employers of any industry, and restaurants are no exception.   I have heard a few renowned chefs recommend eschewing culinary school. You'll learn the french sauces, how to braise meat, and possibly excellent knife skills, but these things can all be learned on the job at an actual restaurant. Why not get paid to learn instead of paying to learn? :)  As far as the upsides of cooking in a restaurant, I'd say the movement and immersive nature of it all is great. Staying active while inhaling flavor and flipping pans? That's a good time to me. I now work in an office all day, and the lack of bodily motion gets old (and kills us in the long run). 
I've been really lucky. I had one early injury as a white belt, but lately it's going really, really well. Feeling pretty good about leg attacks. They run in the family. I'm training out in LA at Cobrinha and at 5 Star, and really enjoying it. I'm very happy and I'm staying healthy so far.   
You've probably seen it, but for those that haven't, the Parts Unknown episode on heroin addiction in Massachusetts was really good. 
In my case, I write everything. I write every word. I have found that the only way I can write is early in the morning, first thing, stone-cold sober. So I will wake up, start writing, and write for as long as I can. I get stupider as the day goes on. I just get stupider and stupider as it gets later in the day. So, yeah, stone-cold sober, first thing in the morning. No other way for me.   Nothing's gonna help me do anything but get distracted. If smoking weed is first on your list of things to do, you're probably not getting to #2. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  
We're hoping to be open by 2019, so we're two years out. We're getting there!  
What an excellent well thought out question. I really wish Anthony answered it. I have that same person (gal) living in me and right now she's winning.  
Soon I hope! It's always a lot of fun to hang out with Joe. I like him very much, I like his podcast. But I will tell you that if Joe Rogan ever wants to demonstrate a choke on you, don't let that happen. He's like, really really really strong, and yeah. Just, it hurts. A lot.  
No. I'm not rolling with that guy, it hurts. He does not roll light, he goes really really hard. He's a neck cranker, by the way, and he's got bowling balls for arms, no visible neck, and he only rolls with no gi. So as much as I love the guy, I'll do anything with him; shoot animals in the brain, canoe trip, hot tubbing, whatever. But I'm not rolling with the guy.  
Louise Brooks, Orson Welles, and James Angleton the former head of capital intelligence for the CIA. There's a couple of questions I'd like to ask him. They're all dead unfortunately.  
It's my special event. You know there's always a special time for me where I move over to Scotch. Generally, when I'm in a philosophical, reflective, or otherwise bittersweet kind of a mood, when I'm drinking alone, listening to music by myself; you know, maybe before a holiday meal or something like that and I have company over. But it's not like every day. I'm a beer drinker, ordinarily. So if I'm drinking expensive whiskey, it's gonna be a special event. 
 I love Girl & the Goat, I love Avec, I really like that restaurant. Who is it, Johnnie's Beef? Good stuff. Any Chicago hot dog is the finest in the land, love that product.   I dunno, Girl & the Goat I really love.  
If he doesnt answer, go eat at Cochon or Toup's Meatery. 
I suppose I would... I would remove the bullshit hierarchy from the film industry, because there are certain people who do my job, and also directors and producers, who seem to think the job they do gives them license to treat people who work for them badly, and there is no good reason for that, and it should not be tolerated.  I know that if I ever get to direct, it will not be present anywhere on my set.   
George Clooney... Jennifer Lawrence... I just think they'd be really cool, Paul Rudd, I met him and was like "You're awesome!" I just want to work with people you can get on with, and you have a good rapport with, and those are definitely some of them. Also directors more than actors, whom I think "I want to work with them." So you know, people like the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, again, it's directors i suppose I get more excited about than actors.  
well, which Hedwig? There were 3 or 4. I imagine they are all still living with Gary Gero, who was the head of the animals department on Potter. I imagine he is looking after them all somewhere. I imagine they are all at the home where actor owls retire to.  
Oh! I mean... anywhere you'd care to name. I've been recognized in Antigua, I got recognized a lot there.   There isn't anywhere in the world Potter hasn't reached.  I was on a roller coaster, I think it was in Paris, actually, and it was in the middle of winter, and I was wearing basically like a thing in England, don't know if you have them here, we called them "Snoods" - they're like a warm thing that covers you whole head, basically only shows your eyes, and I was like 12 years old, I was wearing one on a roller coaster, and I guess my eyes do give me away because the people BEHIND us somehow recognized me and asked an autograph when we got off the coaster !And we were like "How did you SEE me?!" it was impressive.  
Um.... Well, growing up, my favourite comic book character was Daredevil, so Daredevil was great, but there was also, like, if I could be one character from all of literature it would be... Woland from my favourite book, wait no, I change my answer, I would be Behemoth the cat from my favourite book which is called The Master and Margarita, and he is like, a 5 foot tall black cat who shoots a revolver.  
That's a *GOOD* question. I don't know yet, I haven't narrowed it down, but because I've very recently - like within the last 6 months - watched the original Star Wars movies, I'm like a brand new Star Wars fan, so I might go with something Star Wars related! And I got to go out to the Star Wars set recently, because a lot of my friends are working on it crew-wise.. so something Star Wars related, but not sure yet.  Any suggestions?   I'm leaning towards Boba Fett, but I haven't found a good enough costume yet.  
Probably Sirius. Like I always loved the character, and then Gary's portrayal of him I thought was perfect. Or Lupin, really. Any of the characters my dad used to hang out with, other than Wormtail. There was always something bout those two guys I loved a lot.  
Hispanic guy here:  Tamales.  There's really nothing that tastes better than a good tamale.  Not one of those weak Texas tamales that are the size of a Vienna sausage either.  I'm talking about tamales made by poor people in California & Mexico.  Tamale quality is inversely proportional to the standard of living of the people making them.  I don't know why. 
Oh yeah, of course. I wasn't going to leave there without grabbing a set of glasses! 
Um... well, recently a couple of people have asked me to sign a piece of paper so they can then get it tattooed. And, you know, that's pretty weird. Just because I have pretty horrible handwriting - that AMA sign was me printing, but you should see my cursive, it's not pretty! So yeah, I would advise people against doing that. I have signed a picture of Elijah Wood - and I think we've also both said in interviews that we would like each other to play each other in films of our lives - but I was on a red carpet in Japan, and this Japanese man gave me a picture of Elijah, and I knew i wasn't going to get past the language barrier to explain, so I wrote "I am not Elijah Wood, signed Daniel Radcliffe."  And then also people seem obsessed with getting me to sign baseballs, which I don't understand... Quidditch balls would be relevant, at least, but just baseballs, for no reason at all.  
I would attribute it to my parents and also to the crew of the Potter films, who were very good at treating us like kids rather than as actors, as they should have done. But yeah, it's hard to say what it comes down to. I think also when you grow up in the media, you get a very clear sense of how crazy the media is, and you know - basically the countdown that Emma's birthday was to when she turned 18, or 17, or whatnot, it was insane. It was insane. And I think when you see that perspective that we all saw at very young ages, you do get an extra level of awareness maybe. But also, thank you for the compliment of saying we are all grounded and intelligent, that is very nice.  
Um, the Colbert Report. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Yeah, like I JUST discovered them, and I am *obsessed* at the moment! They're amazing yeah! And there's also an English show, called The Thick of It, which is kind of a show - Armando Ianucci who does VEEP, it was the political show that spring boarded him to start working here, and it's some of the best, funniest television that's ever been made.  
God... I should probably about the one that was pulled on ME, rather than any I pulled. Because it came from a very unexpected place.  There's - in the 3rd film - there's a shot in the great hall of all the kids sleeping in the great hall, and the camera starts very very wide, and comes in so that it's an inch from my face, a very long developing set, yeah, and Alan Rickman decided he would plant one of those fart machines in my, uh, sleeping bag, and they waited until like -the camera had come in for this huge DRAMATIC developing shot, and then unleashed this tremendous noise in the great hall.  I immediately thought: "This is one of the other kids fucking around, and we were going to get in trouble."  But as it turns out, it was one of the members of Britain's acting royalty.   I think I laughed a lot, was probably a bit embarrassed, but it was really really funny.  
HAHAHA!  Um, yeah! I mean, pretty terrifying! The first few years I was genuinely quite intimidated by Alan, just because of the voice and the way he sort of carries himself. But as I grew up, I realized he was one of the kindest and most supportive members of that cast to me. I mean, Alan has cut short holidays that he's been having to come and see me in plays, and take me out for dinner afterwards to talk to me about stuff, I think when he realized how serious I was about wanting to be an actor, and he knew what a particular world the Potter set was to grow up in, he just sort of made it his - he just really wanted to help us all and has been very helpful to me, certainly.  
Well, one of the moments in my life that will forever be... you know, immortal in my memory, would be - because Gary Oldman is a bass player, a very good bass player, yeah, and, um, I started learning bass on the 3rd film when he joined the cast. And so one day, I think actually maybe on my 14th birthday, that day started with Gary teaching me the bass line to "Come Together" by the Beatles, yeah! And you know, that was just an amazing, amazing moment. What else... Michael Gambon was always also hilarious to be around. Something not every knows about Michael is that he collects and restores antique dueling pistols. Yeah! And they're really his passion, much more than acting is, and, uh, I remember he one morning gave me a demonstration of how you would shoot a man in a duel with a 17th century pistol in one hand and his morning coffee in the other!  Yeah, so my life has been blessed with many surreal, cool moments like that.  
Hmmm.  I suppose I'm trying to... I'm trying to care less what people think of me, and the way I have done that, very successfully the past few months now, is *not* look at stuff on the internet. That is the key.  
He really does! Um, and, er, he also owned at one point, at one point he owned llamas and a hovercraft, you heard correctly, hahaha, and a 1950's chevy pickup, he had a collection of weird and wonderful things at his house.  
The villain. 100%. I think it's generally more interesting, and honestly, more what I'm suited for, to be honest. I don't see myself necessarily - I mean, I know there was a lot of action in Potter and I liked those sequences, but I don't think of myself as a natural action star.  
I mean, I... to me, it's not a... to me I absolutely think I would be in Gryffindor! But there's never any doubt of that for me. Yeah. I like, maybe I'm just biased because I played one for so long, but I could never picture myself in any other colours.  
Ehm - not particularly.  I think we had very quickly become aware that stuff was not going to be in all the films that we couldn't fit everything in, I think I remember the thing early on that me, Emma and Rupert were all slightly surprised by, that we had all ABSOLUTELY LOVED the chapter in the Chamber of Secrets book about the - I think was it Nearly Headless Nick's Birthday Party? But I think it was some sort of a ghost birthday party that was not in the films, and I remember at the time we were all quite surprised by that. I know some people would have been quite happy to see a 4 hour long Harry Potter movie with every detail in there, but some people also would not have...  
So sort of like the Departed but with shorter guys? 
Ok, that's a good question. I would go with WOLF for the land animal, definitely, because I've always loved wolves. I think... for the air animal, it would have to be maybe like an albatross, one of those long distance journey birds, that would cool. And then for a *sea animal*... I guess I'd want to be a shark, because not much could fuck with you! Because the sea strikes me as a horrible place, anything could kill you all the time, so the sea is where you would want to be a shark. Like a great white or a Hammerhead, maybe Hammerheads because they are more social.   So maybe a hammerhead shark, to be specific. Because i like the power of being a shark, but i don't like the isolation of a great white's life.  
It was actually a really lazy photographer that wanted to get his editor to stop bugging him. 
Well, I watch a lot of sports videos and stuff like that. I think the NFL Bad Lip Reading might be one of my favourite YouTube things. I watch a lot of Ted Talks, in terms of things on the internet.   What else do i watch? That's the thing... I like all sorts of, it's great for research, YouTube, and watching Alan Ginsberg debate William Buckley, things like that. I lost a lot of time like that, because since then I've watched all of Buckley's interviews like that with Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky... Because it's kind of intellectual heavyweight debate that is gone from television now, but is still cool to watch. And because I met him quite recently, in the last few days I've been watching a lot of Russell Brand's videos on there. I met him because he was promoting his new book in the UK. Normally I immediately distrust actors as soon as they are talking about politics, because i think it's quite self-serving, but he's *very* sincere, and I really got on with him when I met him.  
Um, we listened to heavy metal, basically. That was it. Yeah! And because the two guys that were doing the makeup, Mike McCarthy and Mike Fields, they were both big metal heads, and I mean, the actual process -they made it *so* easy - the horns themselves only took about 20 minutes to put on, and even some of the more extreme makeup that we had near the end only took a couple of hours, so you know, I had it easier than a lot of actors do. And yeah, so Metallica, Megadeth, and what was the other band we listened to loads of... *shit*... can't remember it'll come back to me.  
You know what, I don't think we did I'm pretty sure. Because I think that by that point, they had figured out my handwriting was so bad that they would never let it be seen in the film. So I'm pretty sure one of the props guys wrote "Harry Potter" neatly on a piece of paper for me to put in.  
VERY important. To be honest, if Alex Aja and Joe Hill are happy with my performance, then I'm happy with it! Those are the two people I'm thinking about most, and talking to most, about my thoughts on the character and my approach to it.  
HAHA! Brilliant.   Just like... it was exhausting, but New Zealand's lovely all year 'round.  
Well, because of the nature of the Horns mean that people confess their deepest, darkest stuff to him, and do crazy things around him all the time, it sort of means that the challenge as an actor is doing justice to the insanity of the situation that you're in, and reacting appropriately to the craziness, but also keeping it grounded and real and truthful, because you can't just have, you know, 2 hours of people freaking out, that's not interesting to watch.  So yeah, the challenge was finding the balance between the craziness of the story, and the *very real* tone that we wanted to get for the film.  
Em - the Potter Puppet Pals were always, I thought, very very funny. It is hard to make really good Harry Potter jokes, though, because a lot of them have been done, but I thought Puppet Pals were very funny. The best "Alan Rickman as Snape" impression was, 100%, Bill Hader when I did Saturday Night Live, yeah, but maybe my favourite joke at Harry Potter's expense was in South Park, the episode, The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring. It's not a very PC joke, but it really made me laugh.  
I haven't been approached! And I don't know - haha- I don't know what I would do. My lack of Game of Thrones knowledge was revealed in an interview a while ago. I totally would side with the Starks, though, because their symbol is a wolf.  
Not really.  Even as a kid, I hadn't the full scope of the Harry Potter phenomenon, hadn't really, ever, made an impression on me I guess? Obviously I'd read the first couple of books, but I wasn't as into it as a lot of my class was, so no, I could never have imagined it was as big as it was. I think maybe it's only now that I'm really starting to get a fuller sense of how wide-reaching it was, and how many people's lives it affected, which is very cool.  
I'm listening to a lot of Jamie T's music lately, his new album's great... what else have I been listening to? First Aid Kits, I"m really into them right now. I've also rediscovered somebody around called Sister Rosetta Tharp, and you should all - she is just an amazing singer from the 1940's and 50's, way ahead of her time, great voice.  
Cool! Thank you very much! Well, I did a romantic comedy that came out this summer called "What if" that is pretty funny, and I hope I get to do a lot of comedy for the rest of my career. It's what i grew up watching, mostly, so I am definitely drawn to it, and I like to think I bring a bit of it to anything I do - even a dramatic film like "Kill Your Darlings" can have some very light moments to it as well.  
Yeah... favourite scene to film... god... that is a *really hard* question, to pick just one... the first thing that comes to mind, and it's a silly one, but doing all the Gringott's stuff in the last movie with Rupert and Helena and Warwick and Emma, that was like a really fun time. We were all enjoying ourselves in that, it's an action sequence so it was quite, it was more of a technical challenge than an emotional one, so it was a lot of fun to get right.  
I think it stays very true to the book. Of course some things have to change, but to me, what makes the book remarkable is the mixing of the romantic elements, the comic elements, and the, sort of, horror and fantasy stuff, and what we have absolutely done in the film is captured all those tones and they compliment each other beautifully as they do in the book. So that would be the biggest success of the movie's adaptation.  
1) Fantastic! He is an amazing technical actor as well, because he's directed episodes of MAD MEN, so he has an understanding of the technical side that most actors couldn't dream of. And he's incredibly generous and funny as well, and I saw him actually not long ago, we had dinner in London.   2) You know what, I'm ashamed to say I don't know that show, and I will go look at it immediately! So thank you for the recommendation!  
Um... I suppose the worst thing is that because I was a child actor, you get a lot of questions about like, you know, you get a lot of, for a while is that child actors were perceived as bratty and obnoxious, so you come up against that quite a bit. And the best thing, is, obviously, being mistaken for Elijah Wood.  
No, I haven't. There was one yesterday, actually, and I'm here. You know, I love the NFL, and I'm actually from London, so I feel like I am *the* exact target audience for the proposed London NFL team, and yet even I think it's a ridiculous idea, like the idea that American players would be forced to play for a London team which they wouldn't have the same amount of, you know, pride in playing for is a very odd thing. I want to see LOADS of NFL, I love they do games at Wembley, but a London team is, I think, a bit odd to me.  
When you do a show on Broadway, the overwhelming sense of how excited everyone is to *be* there, from the audience to the people you are working with in the show, is *amazing* and creates one of the most exciting working environments I've ever been in. And, you know, the bond that is formed by doing a show together for a year is really something quite remarkable. And you know, I have probably more friends in terms of the people I see regularly from HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS even from something like Potter, to be honest, because there are relationships you form - that's the way I've always found it generally, with film the strongest bonds i form are with the crew, and with theater I form the strongest bonds with the cast, because when you are onstage and have to look out for each other's backs in that way, it forms a very very strong connection.  
Yeah! The Shining is probably my favourite, and Straw Dogs, and tell you what, just because it has a nostalgic place in my heart - ANACONDA.  
Um, I am much more of like a sports gamer. So I love the Madden games, all the NFL stuff, boxing games, Fifa a bit, but I also love Call of Duty. I can get lost on that for a few hours. But yeah, I'm not very good at video games. I tend to play them to the point where - I think the reason I like sports games is because there are no levels to get through, because i always reach a point on other games where I can't get any further, and it's not fun anymore, so that's when I ditch them and go back to playing Madden.  
Oh.  I think, again, and I'm sorry, it's like the third time I've referenced it in this AMA, but I would go with The Master and Margarita, because it has never been done as well as it could be, so I am hoping I will meet that eccentric billionaire at some point.  
Yes, of course, absolutely, God! I think that was part of the huge success of those books, is that it taps into a set of powers and a fantasy world that literally *everybody* would love to be a part of. I think I would be a fantastic one if I were really one in real life. I think I would probably be, like, one of the cool Dark Arts teachers. There weren't very many good ones, but I would be the Lupin equivalent.  
Um, I don't really drink much tea! If I do, it's with a little bit of milk and no sugar. But in terms of breakfast... I mean, um, my ideal breakfast would probably be eggs benedict with a large bowl of cereal brand - it's stuff called CrunchyNut, yeah, which you *can* get in America, but you really have to search for it, but it's an English cereal, and it's the best. With milk, oh yeah. No fruit, don't be silly. Just basically eggs, bacon, bread and cereal in any form is my ideal breakfast.  
Um... I would say: Oooh! I would say a few different types of cheese, maybe like, a gruyere in there, with some cheddar as well, you have to have some meat, if it's not bacon it should be Parma ham or something like that, maybe a few different types of ham, in fact, and then ideally some sort of brioche-bun thing... some sort of brioche-y type bread would be ideal. TOASTED! Toasted, absolutely! It's all got to be melting into each other.  
I mean, that is actually very difficult.  I would probably try and fight the huge duck. Because I think that I could sort of... try, if I could break it, then I could have the giant duck as my steed! So I think i'd go for that, because 100 tiny Elijahs, they are going to be very hard to control, I feel like that would be the last scene out of Toy Soldiers or something like that.  
Originality... wit... a good moment of transformation, if you would have it, for a character in some way so the character isn't the same at the end of the story as he was in the beginning, it could be anything like that, or the story itself, it's all those things you're looking for! It could be the director you're doing the movie with, or people you are going to be working with, those are all things you factor in when deciding what you're going to be doing next.  
Nothing, actually. I didn't! I just got up and started doing interviews.  
It will depend (unfortunately, because i might be starting a job in November) - I would love to be able to keep this facial hair for as long as I can, but it's always work depending! And I don't want to make a promise to charity and then welch to charity. But one year I hope to do it, and raise funds with a proper Movember!  
He's actually answered this before.  In twenty years or so, he suggested James Potter.  For decades later, he suggested Dumbledore. 
that feel when Daniel answers the questions above and below yours but not yours :( 
I knew I had better wrestling than him so the game plan was the clinch and take him to the ground. That plan went out the window! 
I was bullied when I was in middle school which lead me to taking up Tae Kwon Do at a young age. I loved martial arts and competing so MMA was just a natural progression.  
It was probably the best thing to happen to me TBH.  
This was the first time I've encountered this type of behavior but I don't pay any attention to it. I've always looked up to Solid Snake from MGS and thought "wish I could be like him" or "what would Snake do in this situation".  
We new he had heavy hands so the plan was to wrestle him but he stood so close in front of me so I just hit him until he went down.  
Not at all. I knew I had a lot of punching to do the next day :) 
He talked a lot of trash up until the fight. I just remember thinking "keep cool Ben, save it for tomorrow". Thank god i did.  
Many fighters like showy jerks but they have the ability to back it up. This guy didn't.  
Being a local Aussie now with a 7 fight win streak I'd love to fight on that card! 
I speak about 50/50. I try to go back every year!  
1. I'm not sure. He's done this in the past in his previous fights.   2. I love riding so much that it doesn't bother me. I commute on a motorcycle on average about an hour and a half daily. I love it! 
I'm pretty sure every 90s Vietnamese kid had experience Monkey King and it's millions VHS tapes stuffed into a clothes drawer.   Kinda Cliche but Bruce Lee. Be like water my friend! 
Ronda would crush them. She is all finesse, not strength!   
Not yet thankfully. Not sure what I would do in that situation. Maybe go to de-pants the guy. That's the best way to defuse a fight.  
It's my favorite anime actually! My walk out song is "Inner Light". I've also cosplayed as Ippo at cons 
I eat pretty clean but now I'm trying a low carb high fat diet which I haven't noticed much of a different. I miss carbs, mainly rice! 
I'm not a big fan on Crossfit. Olympic lifts are not designed to be done in many reps. All my MMA training is sports specific. The best way to get better at something to do that something.  
Maybe for the next 5-10 years? I am definitely looking forward to coaching when I retire.  
"I'm gonna show you a thing or two tomorrow son!" Vietnam represent! 
Good question. After my third loss in a row, I started taking more of a scientific approach to my conditioning. In a sense it made me able to endure so much more. It felt really good, like what I was doing was worth it.  
For some odd reason, any stranger that starts to get to know me calls me Ben10 so it just stuck for me.  
Clique but Bruce Lee's "Be like water" sticks with me. Being able to adapt to any situation that presents in front of me is crucial in my life.  
Long story short, I moved to Thailand to get away from the 9-5, met my future wife who is Aussie, started getting fights left and right here in Aus. I feel like I'm at a great place :) 
It was entirely shot at night. We were pretty giddy most of the time. I saw it last week by chance, and had a flood of fond memories. On the first day of shooting, Val Kilmer (genius) almost choked to death on a piece of catering chicken *right* before we shot the first scene of the movie. His eyes were still watering until we got to his close up.  I'm so happy he's still with us.  
Gore Vidal wrote an excellent novel around 1962, about an emperor, Julian. I believe he was just after Constantine and Constantius, so roughly 4th Century Common Era (A.D.). I'm too old to play him, but it's an incredible story.  
Yes, thank you. I fondly recall a Yorkshire terrier named Sturgis. I teased him mercilessly. I beg his forgiveness. We were buddies, though.  
*chuckle*  Excellent question.  It started with the first Iron Man: a guy named Pedro from *Shave of Beverly Hills*. I mean, this guy's an artist. He's like the Edward Scissorhands of Mustaches and Beards. And *then*, once you set a standard, it's all about upkeep and modulating it. It tends to be a lot of work, but I'm glad you appreciate it.  
**I've been *waiting* for this question.**  Garlic.  Extra cheese.  Onions.  Spinach.  Pepperoni.  
I have enough trouble getting online. I *wish* I was a gamer. It seems like gamers have more fun!  
It was beyond my comprehension for the first 2 years. And now I see it as a logical, lucky, entertaining piece of history.  
If anything, it was more a sense of profound respect. But putting him on the stand was *definitely* one of the trickier things I've ever attempted.  
I remember driving a classic convertible, first day of shooting, no experience with the car, it was a big boat, and I have to fit it right into a parking spot with a sandbag, that sort of thing. And I remember being so proud that i didn't bang up the car, or overshoot the mark and knock over the monitors or something.  
Hard to say. I suspect when this superhero stuff gets tired, I'll look for a historical character and dig deeper than ever. And then I bet Al Pacino will win that year anyway.  
Development can be super-rewarding. But to be honest, probably promotion. Once you have a product you believe in, taking it on the road, and telling it!  If you haven't seen Gerard Depardieu and Andie McDowell in Green Card, I highly suggest it.  
*Excellent* question.  Probably our hemp-headed forefathers. I guess they'd be called Founding Fathers. I'm pretty sure Jefferson grew a bunch of weed...   
Meet me at Applebee's. And we'll figure it all out. No harm, no foul. I have no recollection of any negative behaviors on your part. Give yourself a *break*! 
Rodney Dangerfield was a *true* original. *Extremely* kind. Wickedly funny. *Forget* the costumes - I had more gelatine in my hair than you'd use for 100 bowls of Jell-O! You could literally bounce a tennis ball off my hair. It was crispy - it turned into, like, they were like bamboo horns. It was the best.  
Very impressed with Benedict. Such smart writing on that show. I have screen envy.  
I'd say about half and half. Oftentimes, on the day, they'll scribble out a bunch of alternatives, and see which one works best in the edit.  
Haha!  The Hulk is a slob.  Bruce Banner's etiquette is right out of the Tiffany Book of Table Manners. I remember shooting that shawarma post-credit scene, and having just finished Avengers: Age of Ultron, wondered how we'd beat it. Joss says "The way to win is to not try."  
Yes, we have a Sherlock 3 in development. We want it to be the best of the series, so that's a pretty tall order. *Also,* Perry Mason is a property I'm looking forward to developing further, going back to the 1931 book series...similarly to what we did with the first 2 Sherlocks, mining the original material for things that are "new."  
A boat, an umbrella, my family, a bouncy house, and a *really* big teepee. Then it would just be an eco-lodge vacation.  
I *love* running into kids who didn't expect to see me. I once ran into a four year old who just happened to be wearing a Captain America mask at the time. It seemed natural to him, being that he was Cap, to see some of his friends around. I think I was more excited than him.   For the most part, autograph collectors are pretty cool, and when they're weird, you just try to forget them.  
It's the closest thing to a perfect film I've ever been part of.  
It's important to remember to eat, catch yourself when you're getting irritable, recognize when you're feeling lonely, and not burn out when you're tired.  
Nothing is *impossible.* But there might be a fair amount of red tape involved in something like that. I love Clark Gregg, and am pleased the show is doing so well.  
Fortunately, it's about an affably self-important white guy who thinks he understands the "black experience." It was *so* wrong and outrageous that it was forgivable. But I certainly was happy to hear from my African-American friends that they were okay with it, and some of them even delighted in telling me what relative it reminded them of. Somebody just told me just the other day that they're convinced that I was channeling Wesley Snipes. He's a pretty cool customer, so I don't want to presume I would be up to the task.  
It was an offhanded remark to a journalist and friend. I have other projects in mind for Mel and I - sooner than later the Marvel Roster will be made public and *all* questions will be answered.  
I'm terrible at recalling practical jokes...  I hear about a lot of these onset practical jokes, I don't recall having witnessed one. Shoots can be pretty high strung - performance anxiety, all that. You wouldn't want to send them over the edge.  
No risk, no reward.  There are times in our lives when you gotta put all your chips in the middle.  
I love you too!  Here it comes: gluten-free crackers, almond butter, cherry jam, and rice milk. It gives you a little protein... sometimes just a handful of Rice Chex'll do it.  
*Thank you*, first of all!  The Perry Mason project we're developing is kind of a pre-"Chinatown" gumshoe thriller with some courtroom stakes, and action sequences. So you've got one in the pipes, just for you.  
It's funny you'd bring that up. A writer asked me to watch a particular episode about a month ago, in hopes of helping us break story on a project. An incredible series. Anything's possible.  
I think the sexiest thing about Scarlett Johansen is her voice, more so than any physical feature. 
I'm not RDJ, but I'm going to go ahead and say "Star in multibillion dollar comic book franchise." That seems like a solid career path.  ps You are very funny. 
I can't say "favorite book," but reading all the J.D. Salinger novels and short stories in my teens was a pretty big deal.  
The shooting draft was like a Swiss watch. Obviously, there was more room to play outside of the courtroom. Fortunately, this isn't a courtroom drama, and it's more of a destination for the showdown between Hank and The Judge. By the time we were in court, we largely stuck to the script, but it was so well-written, a lot of it feels improvised.  
I'm an *okay* dancer. I remember attending modern jazz classes in New York when I was a teenager, and instructors stopping the class and asking me if I wouldn't mind leaving. Correct. I don't know how smooth I am, but about 25 years ago, while I was prepping for Chaplin, had an amazing education in movement from a variety of experts. Ben Kamen, Johnny Hutch, Lord Attenborough himself... 
Redditor for an hour, only comment ever, looks like this checks out. 
Hehe!  I tend to do a lot of strength training for the Marvel pics, but more just to not look like Olive Oyl next to all of the other studs.   I wouldn't know that I... have any? I do have a great trainer, named Brad Bose, a great martial arts instructor named Eric Oram, and I also train with the Tracy Anderson system. But that's more Susan's field of expertise.  
*chuckle*  The Judge is a departure of sorts in that Hank starts off in a way audiences might compare to other roles, but there's a significant change and an eventual humility.  *I* think Tony and Sherlock are pretty dissimilar, and always strive to not seem like a guy who's fascinated with playing himself, regardless of the character.  
Me.  Jimmy Fallon.  Jack Black.  Jamie Fox.   And...we'd all be the backline for Gwyneth Paltrow up front.   "GP and the Goops." 
Like the I-Ching, I am ever-changing.   That said, Pelican cases do tend to rotate in and out of necessity. I usually have vitamins, smart phones, credit cards, tasers, and daffodils.  
I'm a Marvel guy. So it's apparent what team I'm on.   *Hmmm.*   Duck-sized horses. I'd put on my tap shoes and lay waste to them, as I shuffled off to Buffalo...  
That would be like a random government office being inspected by the President. 
So, casu marzu is a very strong cheese. If she's not a very adventurous eater, I don't think she's going to be too keen having maggots in her mouth. But, I don't want to just talk about your willy.  Here's the thing. In order to get these taste buds moving faster, have a bit of fun with this. Blindfold her, and have some fun with spooning her some sort of strange, awkward, sexy foods, and you'll see that confidence fly in a way that she'll get so much more exciting with all flavors. But blindfold her, have some fun with it, and play with it. You'll see she'll get more adventurous.   
So opening the steakhouse in Vegas was one of the most daunting and dangerous things I've ever done. The team are brilliant. I visit my steakhouse about 12 times a year, and we cook dinner only.  So, I grew up to speed about 15 years ago when I first started coming to the US about how well they did steakhouses. I sat, watched, absorbed, and learned; and when I got the chance to open Gordon Ramsay Steak, we actually have an impact on the scene. So yeah, there's my DNA. The standard is incredible, the staff is friendly; but it's got that really cool Britannia feel, and I'm all over it like a rash. I talk to them on a daily basis through email, but that restaurant means such a lot to me personally that, yeah I spend a lot of time there. So yeah, that's definitely the real deal.  
I think foam should be used for shaving, not go on top of food. Because when a foam hits a plate, unless you've eaten it within 3 or 4 seconds, at the end it looks like sort of toxic scum on a stagnant pool. So I started with foams in the 90s, and I'm still amazed that they're around now. So we need to get rid of the foam, and keep foam for shaving.  
That's a very good question because every time we do something really high-end, costly, and shiny, I need to go do something really raw and cutting edge. So, *Sharkbait* was an amazing documentary where I went off to Taiwan, got on a boat, hijacked it, and you know, tried to stop finning--shark fins and the decimation of sharks and the population. So *Sharkbait* was one of the biggest and most prolific I've ever done.  And then I think, I love going live. Cooking live, and nobody knows, but I can actually cook for 60 minutes live across the nation without cursing once. It's fucking hard, but I'll have a good go.  
I will definitely go back to Glasgow, We are currently looking at a site in Edinburgh and a site in Glasgow. It means a lot to me to go back there. Losing my head chef from that restaurant broke my heart, so I can't wait to open up again in Glasgow. It would be a dream come true again. Definitely!  
 My favorite moment on Masterchef was when Christina Tosi and I were in the middle of a field and we were about to go head to head with red team versus blue team, and we were doing a coin toss. Christina flicked the coin, and fell flat on her ass. And it was that funny moment, that it was like, *oh my god*, one of the best pastry chefs in the world can't even flip a coin! And she flipped, and she slipped on her Wellies, and she did the splits, rolled on her back, got covered in mud, and it was all over the flip of a coin. It was *so* funny.  
I would love it to happen. I'm pissed that it hasn't, and I've offered him a head start, I've offered to pay for his flight, I've offered to send a plane for him...here's the thing. Chefs need competition, and I think that's healthy. We both work for Caesar's; Caesar's put it on this table for this year to celebrate their 50th birthday for him and I to have a live cook-off, and Bobby lost his balls. It literally castrated him.  I will be the first one to make sure that we go head to head in a live cook-off. How exciting would that be?! Come on!  There's a lot of chefs in America that I respect. I get a hard time from all those chefs, but I respect them immensely. So, it's no different than two basketball teams playing against each other. It's no different between America and Great Britain playing against each other in soccer. Have a bit of fun with it! It was going to charity, and don't get so stressed out! Come on!  
 So, I would say take an incredible scrambled egg recipe and...how do you synthesize that into something incredibly glamorous? I put sea urchins inside a scrambled egg once, and it was a sort of sea urchin butter that I had leftover, and it elevated scrambled eggs into something really different, and it gave it a really nice sort of salty, fresh, creamy flavor. So we have it on the menu today in our establishment, and it's topped with caviar, but it was amazing to see what sea urchin can do, finished and whipped inside a scrambled egg. Incredible!  
Excellent. That's a really good question. Chickpeas. I lived in the south of India, just outside Kerala. I went into this amazing Ashram. They made this incredible chickpea curry, with a fresh masala, and it was done in a tomato gravy. The flavor honestly was incredible. Yea, chickpeas, absolutely incredible! Celery, onions, vegetables, it was incredible. The only thing you need to do is cook the chickpeas in a pressure cooker, make a fresh masala, lots of ginger, lots of tamarind, fresh tamarind. You won't need protein, chickpeas. Just make sure, you go to the bathroom before you past wind. Don't do it at the table because it lingers beyond belief! 
That's a really good question, because for the last 10 years I've been asked that about 2,000 fucking times. I'm never gonna answer that question.  A) I'm not that bad to be on death row, and,  B) If it was my last supper, ask me that question in 40 years' time when I'm 90 years of age, I can't go to the bathroom properly, and I need my ass wiped on a regular basis.  So, yeah. Gimme 4 decades' time, and I may be close to answering that question, because I could be nearing my last supper. Until now, fuck off. I'm miles away.  
Yea, there's been lots that I've been proud of. Christina Wilson, who won Hell's Kitchen 3 years ago, to see what is is doing now in Vegas and how prolific she is has been brilliant. Christina Hart, the blind cook on Master Chef, she is not presenting Master Chef Vietnam, she's involved with Master Chef Australia. I have a look with some of the youngsters  that we have been working closely with over the last 3 years on Master Chef Jr. Young Addison, Logan, Alexander. We are taking about 8-sort of 12/13 year olds, seeing the way the can be better and not being spoiled by the exposure of having a reputation on TV. They are focused on their job at hand and continue their passion. I'd say there are about two dozen individuals over the last 4-5 years. Those aren't necessary all those who came in first of second in the competition, I'm talking about contestants who have been in the top ten, top five, so yea, there's a lot that I'm proud of.  
I work incredibly hard. I have about 3-4 hours a day off and I work my freakin ass off because I get so excited with projects! I never started cooking because I wanted to become rich, I have an incredible about of energy. One day I will slow down. I think for me the app was a fun thing to do because it gives you a little bit of excitement in the industry of what's happening, how much creativity you have, and handle that pressure. What's next..we're talking, right now, about something really exciting in America, regarding The F Word. My dr eam is to bring The F Word to America. That has lots of excitement, lot of content, a lot of foodie elements that I think would go down well. So that's what we're working on right now. I'll reveal more in a month's time but I'm really excited about The F Word. Finally, potentially, making it's way toward America.  
Big fan of toasties, big fan of cheese, living in France for three years, it's one thing I grew up loving there was cheese, and now I'm obsessed over it. So, Red Leicester is a really beautiful cheese; it's a very strong, mature cheddar. But Red Leicester is an amazing cheese. It's made in Devon now, with great sheep's milk. Strong mature cheddar that gets sort of caramelized and bubbly is the best for a toastie. I'm not a big fan of salted cheese; I much prefer a nice rustic, mature cheddar, not so salty.  
My guilty pleasure with food would have to be cookies and crack pie. Working with Christina Tosi over the last 2 years...If it's my birthday, she'll send me a cracked pie, if I'm staying at the Nomad Hotel in New York, she'll send me a box of cookies. Honestly, I don't give a damn about that cracked pie having three thousand calories per slice. Just getting in there is incredible. I suppose the more stuff I eat like that, I suppose the harder I train. I sort of torture myself, in a way, like "right I've just eaten two cookies, I feel like a fat bastard. I just eaten half a cracked pie. Tomorrow's training session is going from two hours to four hours." So I'll eat the calories but I'll make sure I burn them off within 24 hours. My thoughts on the In and Out Burger, I wish that they were set up in London because if there's one thing I miss flying out of LA, it's an In and Out Burger. 
 I would go down the rouse of recently we've been using lots of dry spaghetti, with lots of coffee garlic, chili, preserved lemons. Once we've roasted off the garlic, the chili, the shallots folded in the spaghetti, olive oil. We've been putting some really nice cans, tuna, over the top of the spaghetti, so it's almost like a sort of quick fish past the dish but your using cans, very good cans, of tuna. with some fresh capers, parsley, and a little bit of preserved lemon. Delicious!  
He knows the new one is shit, the silence says it all 
I'm not Gordon, but I think the biggest problem is moisture. The veggies let out a load of steam when they fry and either knock the coating off or loosen it. So maybe try salting the veggies for a bit first to extract moisture (quick rinse + dry on a papertowel after) or dredge them in a bit of extra flour then egg prior to dipping in the actual batter to get a better stick. 
I promised her lasagna. I was too lazy then i made burgers and called them handheld lasagnas. Its all about selling it 
1. For really thin patties, the inside is done when the outside looks done  2. The cooks at your local joint have cooked more burgers in a week than you will in a lifetime.   3. If you get a thermometer and use it, you will never have another overcooked burger or steak again.  
Thank you. Much of the trafficking is done by multinational organised crime networks, and there was certainly an element of danger involved. It was the kind of situation where we (my cameraman and I) would have been killed, or nothing would happen. We came through without any problems, but will never know how dangerous it really was for us. The only death threat I received, bizarrely, was from the family of one of the girls, who didn't want her home.  
The custom of marriage by abduction is particular to Hmong society. Sapa district has a Hmong-majority population and the local authorities tend to turn a blind eye towards it. The tradition helps facilitate abductions of girls to be trafficked and sold in China. With the border so close, and so porous, there's often little the authorities can do about these abductions.   
The most dangerous situations were the initial meetings I arranged with the girls in China. The men who bought them were aware of the meetings, and were known to still be in contact with the trafficking networks. If they had realised I was there to try and help my friends get out of China, anything could have happened.  
Since the girls had both had Chinese-born children by the time I found them, and they themselves had no legal status there, there was extremely little chance of their bringing their children home legally. So they ended up facing the choice between their kids and their own freedom. Initially, both were prepared to leave their children to return to their homes and families in Vietnam, and one actually did. The other found she couldn't leave her child and is still in China.   
They were local girls I'd known previously, from living in Vietnam. They were from villages near Sapa, a hill station close to the Chinese border. They would identify as being part of the Hmong minority, rather than Vietnamese.  
Thank you, ibru. During most of my time in Vietnam and China, I kept my work secret from even my closest friends in Vietnam. After one of the girls returned home, however, it became public knowledge that I'd played a part in finding her and helping her home. In the days and weeks that followed, I was constantly being approached in the streets of Sapa with requests to help find missing sisters and daughters. I knew of course that the problem was an enormous one, but that really brought it home.  
Thanks. My friend who came home is doing well. Recently I've had some trouble contacting the friend who remained in China (which has happened numerous times over the past 2.5 years, and isn't particularly alarming). She was fine when we last spoke.  
My background is actually in documentary filmmaking. When I first began learning how devastating and widespread this issue is, I wanted to film it, so I had a cameraman with me from the beginning, and we filmed everything. I didn't realise, of course, what an incredible story we'd stumbled into.  
Keeping the true nature of my work secret was a major concern while I was in Vietnam and China. I'm no longer in the area and, even if I was, wouldn't be particularly worried now since I'm no longer working actively to find/rescue girls 
Thank you. I've answered your first question here already - they're Hmong girls from very poor, rural villages, with little or no formal education. I worked with two fantastic NGOs in Vietnam, Blue Dragon Children's Foundation and Alliance Anti-Trafic. Otherwise it was important to keep my work hidden, as there was no way of knowing how far the reach of the trafficking networks extended.   
Thank you. Awareness of this issue is critical, as is getting more attention and resources allocated to those most at risk - particularly the minority groups along the borders.   
He answered every question about his story, but nothing about specific dollar/percent values. Not sure what that says about OP's legitimacy 
This is the question I was hoping he had answered. Right now it looks like 'friend' just benefits the telling of a story for the benefit of inducing a reaction from the audience than the actual truth. Pity he didn't answer you.  
Generally they won't even be able to speak the local language which prevents them from getting any help at all.  One issue with Chinese culture is that a lot of people will go out of their way to not notice things so not to cause trouble, which is also becoming an issue in many societies around the world. 
Thank you. To be honest, it has been incredibly difficult at times, not to mention expensive, and there were times I did consider stopping. I kept going because I knew how important it would be to share this story with the world, and what a difference it can make in the lives of countless girls at risk of the horrors of trafficking.  
As I mentioned above, the issue of corruption in Vietnam/China isn't one I want to go into detail with, for the simple reason that I'd like the option of returning to those countries, and both countries are less than welcoming towards outside criticism. I will say that parts of this story were a lot more complex and frustrating than they needed to be.  
Trafficking is a very real issue everywhere, including the US, and it's getting worse. It takes various forms, particularly sex and labour trafficking, and exists in places you might least expect it. The best thing to do is educate yourself on the issue, understand which systems you're supporting or starving each time you spend your money, and support organisations fighting trafficking in any ways you can. Victims are very real people, like you or I. They need help.  
Purchase price varies from girl to girl, but it seems they can be bought for as little as 3 or 4 thousand US dollars.  
The initial kidnappers are often quite difficult to catch - many of them are young men from other towns or villages, who disappear after the abduction and are never seen again. I'm an Australian, my government isn't involved :) 
Thank you, and you're right - it was a very challenging time personally. For me, the hardest part was when my friends were facing the decision to leave their babies to go home, or essentially give up on their own lives to stay with them in China. These decisions were going to forever affect lives on both sides of the border. Of course I wanted the see the girls back in Vietnam - but of course I could never advise them to leave their children. That decision was theirs alone to make, and it was very hard to see them struggling through it while remaining impartial.  
Hahaha I don't see myself that way. I would hope that if the same thing happened to me, somebody would come looking for me. That's the kind of society I'd like to live in, so it would be hypocritical to act any other way, wouldn't it? :) 
The trafficked girls are first sold to middlemen in southern China, where they are subjected to threats and essentially drained of any hope of returning home. A girl is then sold to a man looking for a wife. Without any legal status, he can then treat her any way he likes. Many of these girls find themselves in abusive relationships - clearly, if a man considers it fine to buy or sell a woman, he will never give her the respect she deserves as a human being.  
Thank you. That's just the start of what will be a 100-minute film, tracing the entire process of the search and attempted rescues of my friends.  
Thank you. It wasn't a particularly logical decision at the time - I'd known about one particular friend's abduction for about a year, and I realised I would never really rest easy until I did what I could to try and find her. So I did.  
Your POD cast is great!! Shout out to Chuck Nice. You both are hilarious.  
I think it's the multiple attempts of private enterprise to put their money were our dreams are.  At that level, success is not as important as acting on the urge to explore.  Lest we all ossify in the present.  -NDTyson 
Lately I've had about one such incident per week. Although my target is one per day.  I recently learned from some dynamicist colleagues that the striking visibility of Saturn's ring system is not eternal, coming and going with the dynamical forces of all that orbits the planet.  Which means if I were around back when the Dinosaurs roamed and showed them Saturn through a telescope, it might have been an uninteresting sight.  Very sad.  -NDTyson 
I really like Earth.  So any space trip I take, I'm double checking that there's sufficient funds for me to return.  Also, I'm not taking that trip until Elon Musk send his Mother and brings her back alive. Then I'm good for it.  Any demonstration of rocket reusability is a good thing.  When we fly on a Boeing 747 across great distances, we don't throw it away and roll out a new one.  Reusability is arguably the most fundamental feature of affordable expensive things.  -NDTyson 
I'd love me some answers to what Dark Matter is, or Dark energy. I'd also like to know if there is or was ever life on Mars.  These are realistically answerable questions in the next couple of decades.  In the immediate several years to come, there's an emerging cottage industry among planet hunters in which we can make measurements of the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets.  These amounts to a search for "bio-markers" such as Oxygen (O2), methane (CH4), and other signs of unstable molecule that could be made by a sustained biosystem on the planet surface. So watch for headlines there in the coming years.  -NDTyson 
Excellent question.  We think life is alive and a slap of iron is not because, among a few other reasons, we have metabolism.  We consume energy in the service of our existence.  If we find any other entity that does this too, it would make a good candidate for life.  Consider also that you reference and "unearthly" element.  That is not likely at all because the periodic table of elements is full. There's no room for any other elements to be discovered in the natural universe.  And using spectroscopy, we confirm that these very same elements are found in stars across the universe itself.  Not only that, the four most common chemically active ingredients in the universe (H, He, O, C, N) are the SAME four most abundant ingredients in life on Earth.  So our bias in searching for "life as we know it" is not entirely close-minded.  -NDTyson 
I have a cop-out answer to that one.  My favorite question to think about is the one we do not yet know to ask because it's very existence awaits our next discovery -- placing us on a new cosmic vista, requiring ideas and inquiry today undreamt of.  -NDTyson 
I try to best every previous defining moment with a new one.  In that way you don't live in the past, you live for the future. -NDTyson 
Why should knowing we are indeed small in time, space, and size have anything to do with insignificance.  Bacteria surely don't feel that way and they are billions of times smaller than us, yet they do most of our digesting.  Ant's surely don't feel that way yet they likely represent nearly 20% of Earth's biomass.  Why not instead think of how awesome it is that our 3lbs Human brain matter actually figured all this out.  Why not look up to the clear night sky, and reflect on the fact that we don't simply live in this universe, but the universe lives within us -- through the atoms and molecules of our bodies, forged in the hearts of stars that long-ago gave their lives to the galaxy ... and to us.  This is, of course, one aspect of the cosmic perspective that perhaps I and my astrophysics colleagues take for granted, but cannot be told often enough.  -NDTyson 
Wow that sounds very close minded of them. I went to a fairly conservative Christian School my whole life and iirc we watched some of Sagan's cosmos and while evolution was a tricky subject for the teacher he/she still had us disseminate what we could from it and try to view the science from a Creation science perspective. There was no refuting of anything that Sagan said to my recollection. 
Luuuuuv Comedians.   Not a single favorite, but my top eleven, in no order, include: Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Steven Wright, Mitch Hedberg, Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Burr, Jerry Seinfeld, Chuck Nice, Eugene Mirman.  -NDTyson 
Hmm. Maybe a closeup view of a Supernova explosion.  One of the greatest events in the universe.  Happens maybe only once per century per galaxy.  It would look beautiful up close, right up until until the energy intensity vaporized you.  -NDTyson 
Can't answer that, but I can give another kind of response -- I think in the next century we will know for sure whether there is or was ever life in the solar system -- especially on all the fun spot that keeps us wondering from afar -- Mars, Europa, Titan, Enceladus.  -NDTyson 
Embarrassed that I've never seen Rick and Morty.  But I'm generally a fan of smart animation.  And now that you've called me out, I'll put it on my list.  -NDTyson 
What matters in society is not how many STEM professionals are running around.  What a boring world that would be if we were all scientists and engineers. The world needs poets and artists and actors and comedian, and politicians, and even lawyers.  What i see is that if you like STEM, but for whatever reason will not become a STEM professional, you can still gain basic levels of science literacy in your life, and blend that awareness into your work.  This is already happening in the Arts. There's no end of art installations, sitcoms, dramas, screenplays, first-run movies, that have been inspired by science.  Including The Martian, which helped turn the word "Science" into a verb,  and Avatar, the highest grossing film of all time.  So if your will not become a scientist yourself, then do not hesitate to allow science to serve as the artist's muse.  Next in line -- scientifically literate politicians.  -NDTyson 
Metallic hydrogen is not a new idea or concept.  It's actually why on the Period Table of Elements Hydrogen typically appears on both the left and right side -- with metals (on the left) and with gases (on the right).  In any case, whenever we enter the domain of new element behavior or new molecular properties, it's just a matter of time before new and cool applications follow.  So I have no crystal ball, other than to say that in the hands of clever engineers and artists, cool things come from cool scientific discoveries.  -NDTyson 
Science is the most effective thing Humans have ever invented to decode what is real and what is not in the world and the universe.  If anybody every comes up with something more effective then we'll be all up in it.   The limits, as I see it, are the occasional blind spots that result from looking for something we hope or expect to find, rather than for the unexpected.  For this reason, in my field, when we deploy brand new telescopes we try to reserve time for them to enter a kind of serendipity mode, where it looks for anything, rather than what we seek.  Big science is also driven by money made available by governments. So when conducted properly, it doesn't affect what is true but what kinds of discoveries of made -- possibly in the service of the state rather than in the service of the individual curiosity of the scientists themselves.  -NDTyson 
Trying to get the Band back together on the Cosmos thing.  Nothing green-lit yet.  But we are all hopeful  Lots of pistons need to align.  Thanks for that interest.  As for Trump's Executive Orders, sixty million people voted for him. And he won US counties by a landslide.  So if he did not do what he promised them (or what we all expected of him) then he would not be serving his electorate.  Now, if he passes Executive Orders or if Congress enacts legislation that will disrupt the long-term stability of the country and of the planet, then the problem is not Trump, but your (our) fellow citizens who do not fully understand this problem and need to become informed (as is true for any voter) so that when we elect leaders, there is some correspondence between objective reality and governance.   -NDTyson 
To foster an entire generation of scientists as educators so that I can fade away and not even be noticed for having done so.  That's would represent a stunning future of science literacy in the land.  That's a career goal in the sense that then I can return to the lab and publish research papers again.  That's my possibly delusional career goal at this time in my life.  -NDTyson 
At the end of the day, he's an astrophysicist and /r/iamverysmart are just people making fun of other people on the internet. 
Maybe the most interesting question here. Too bad he didn't answer it. I too would love to know about some up-and-coming science educators.  
Wow didn't realize that he was the voice in the narrated part, makes the song even better.  
Entropy is not the enemy people might be led to believe  All it takes is a source of energy to reverse it.  Earth is not a closed system.  We receive energy daily from the Sun, which empowers the chemistry and life of our planet to grow complexity -- against the wishes of entropy.  Consider, however, that the Sun-Earth system, taken together, loses energy and **gains** entropy. And the entire universe itself is on an one-way trip to entropic oblivion, ending not in fire but in ice, and not with a bang, but with a whimper.  Have a nice day.  -NDTyson 
Don't know.  But I'm quite sure that nobody has ever won a championship without enough offense.  -NDTyson 
Nothing would make sense.   it would also be really hard to explain why different parts of Earth see different parts of the sky at the same time.  We would likely be forced to conclude that the people who asserted that Earth was definitely flat were in fact in denial of emergent scientific truths, and that they had no idea of what a scientific truth actually is. -NDTyson 
"A lot of people" i.e. a bunch of unsubstantiated stories on the internet.  Here's another one for you: I met him back in 2014 when he gave a lecture at NC State. He was warm, kind, polite, and funny, and he spent more time answering our questions than he spent lecturing.  Maybe he did actually rub some people the wrong way, who knows, but there's also a powerful motivation to discredit him based on the ideas he propagates, especially climate science. Character attacks, especially those that feed into the "liberal elite" stereotype, would be a simple and effective way to accomplish that goal. 
And you /u/neiltyson, we will watch your response with great interest. 
Check out resources at Khan Academy.  Its an entire website full of free videos that help people learn any level of maths or science you can think of.  You can find their videos on youtube or at the actual Khan Academy website.  Even if your school doesn't offer certain courses you can still learn about them and prepare yourself for higher education courses that way.  Their videos will give detailed explanations and even give some exercises to work on as well to practice. 
CGI man. CGI is so fucking expensive. when i talk about dinosaurs, you can do some cheap, cheesy animation, or try to make it look as real as the movies. to make it look as real as the movies, it's gonna cost you a pretty penny. i also have way more money in the bank to spend than i did when save dat money came out. so i could make these moves easier.  
college drop out. i love almost every song, it came out when i was like a junior in high school, i had never heard of kanye before that obviously, it was just a perfect storm.  
im pretty cheap yea. i drive a 2002 toyota avalon. i do spend recklessly on food though. i just get so hungry 
i knew this would get called out. it kind of is too small most of the time. but sometimes i can pull it off, if the girl gives me the right leverage.   i hope i do, i love those guys. 
no but holy shit, yesterday, i took a meeting in his office. the guy im making my tv show with makes curb with larry. and it's the same office they shoot in for curb. i felt like i was really on the right track in life.  
jerk off every morning before you go in...but honestly, i get boners. i can't help it. i tell the girls "i'm sorry if i get aroused, and i'm sorry if i don't." pretty cool line right  
i wanted a pretty campus, somewhere not too far from home (philly) but not too close. and a good school, with a small undergrad total. checked all those boxes  
it was like 6k, and it was about 2k per video back then, so it bought me 3 videos. and my microphone. 
i never thought about that. but no i dont think so  
youd have to put them neck and neck, no pun intended  
1) i don't know that answer. this stuff takes me a while. and i was touring a lot last year so ive only had the last few months to lock down in the studio. just be patient, i never ever wanna rush stuff.  2. yes for sure. im working on my own tv show. it's just as important to me as music.  
mannnnn. hopefully not too long. do you like it. do you think it's funny  
This^   I mean Juanita's part probably wouldn't have happened if not Snoop  Super nice lady.  
be patient, it takes me a while. i'm working all the time. it'll always be worth the wait, but rushing it and making subpar content is the last thing i want to do. i have really high hopes. 
hmmmm...maybe allen iverson's face on my heart. he just really impacted my life, growing up in philly.  
i have to fuck him or fight him? only two options? id love to just talk to him...but if that's not an option. fight him. it would be such a good, evenly matched fight  
based upon my real life and true experiences. just me being me. a guy trying to be a rapper  
i dont think my fame has effected me in the slightest. i honestly barely feel famous, compared to where i envision ending up. so, i just think to myself about how small of a scale all of the attention is now, to what it will be like in three years. ask me again in three years. hopefully ill be the same dude. i think i will be. ive always envisioned this life for me, so none of if surprises me 
super memorable. i was so nervous. i dont know how i did so well. whenever i get scared about life, i watch that and remember how well i performed under pressure  
brain still gotta poop, look at his twitter @hardbodybrain 
im making new music all the time. some of it sucks. some of it is amazing. youll hear the good stuff only. been working a lot with brain lately too, he's been in the studio a ton. trying to get him out there.  
very up and down, hot and heavy. he loves me, he loves me not type of thing  
if by record you mean song, yeah. but a serious album, i just hope to god nothing happens in my life that would ever have me making 12 unfunny songs. that's just not who i am.  
i think i have to see it through as lil dicky. i truthfully dont like introducing myself as lil dicky, ill always say dave. but lil dicky is like batman, it's a symbol more than a person. know what i mean  
well, a bunch of collabs happened digitally. brendon urie came into my studio though, and sang it right in front of me. so that was my favorite. because as soon as he sang, i knew he was perfect and it was cool to witness the moment in person.  
ex boyfriend no question. cuz i just knew the whole time it would change my life. and it was fun. and back then, you didnt have to get permits, do things officially, you just ran around with a camera and filmed. shout out brian storm - my DP  
i should be so lucky. blond is my favorite album of the last 5 years.  
no we hired a great sound design company, Voodoo Highway Music & Post Inc. 
i respect that. i like that's the first song you heard. it honestly feels amazing to be a professional rapper. its a true dream come true 
If he's never used Young Richard that's a phenomenal AKA for him. 
this was 5 days of shooting. 3 for the bedroom scenes, and the set was built from scratch, we took the walls away during the cgi stuff and had green screens there. then we shot the soldiers stuff in one day. then we shot john c reilly one day  
no my mom has still yet to speak with mrs diddy. id pay so much money to see that. i say fugg too  
man it's a blessing. he's inspiring. so unique in his approach. just a blessing, and i rarely use that word 
i feel good, but id feel better if we got the lakers pick this year. and if everyone wasn't so goddamn hurt all the time.  MVP russ no question (what a good call to choose him for that song right)  ROY - Dario  
drake may be the answer to both questions. im coming to tel aviv for a festival early july, i better see you out there  
i sat across from her at a talent agency one time, and was too scared to say anything. but i snuck a pic and IG'd it, and she commented, just say hi next time  
thats how i started, just on instrumentals i found online. its totally possible. i would use these free, amazing beats to your advantage. take a drake beat and make a sick song out of it. industry beats are way better than ones you'll probably be able to get from some random producer you meet in your town. just be original and creative.  
I can see this going unanswered...feels man. Fuck you Brain we don't need them during an AMA 
one time i woke up in the morning, and saw the condoms on the floor, each one with a hole in it. so i had to bring this girl with me to planned parenthood and get her the morning after pill, all while i was on spring break in australia. it was crazy  
realistically, no. i barely have enough time to go to my friends' weddings. but i still love you guys and respect your union  
honestly, i used to go to the college parties, like 3 years ago. but even then i felt too old. now im 29. i just feel stupid. and then it's just non stop picture taking to the point where it's lost its appeal. but i certainly appreciate the invite  
i just loved being around all those rappers at once. it was fun and cool for me. i liked lil uzi's swag. like just walking around, he would be like "you see it right? you see it..." and it was sooo funny  
no, rappers love me the most. any time i meet a rapper, they make it clear how much they appreciate what im doing.  
i really want malik monk. i think he'd fit perfectly.  
thank you sam tahoe, i appreciate that. i am proud. tits for sure. ass doesn't matter a whole lot to me. i have a small dick so a bigger but could end up being problematic  
dude t pain killed that shit, that was my first time seeing him live and he blew me away. he has choreography! be patient about music. it takes me much longer to make than most artists. the music is very involved. and my personal bar is so high at this point, that it takes a lot to satisfy me. and if i'm not satisfied, i can't show you guys 
so sick. justin bieber came to it and hung out in the green room for a few hours before it, which made it even cooler  
i didn't really quit until like 5 months after i put stuff online...so i think they saw it coming for a while, it didn't necessarily surprise them when i said that i was gonna pursue the music stuff.  
ive gained my independence and freedom. so many people are forced to do stuff they dont love to survive financially. im soooo lucky that i get to do what i love. it's such an amazing thing.  
i wanna be a movie/tv star and comedy writer for sure. just as much as music  
i am a big eagles fan. i feel good about wentz. i think he very well may be a stud  
i love kevin hart, and one time i had a show in vegas by a pool, and out of nowhere, kevin hart was on stage with me, hype manning my entire concert. that was pretty surreal.  
mannn, i have hard days for sure. but ironically, ive had a few of my best days creatively the day AFTER my worst days. when i have bad days, i just always keep in mind that it's a part of the process. you cannot let it get you down. gotta stay the course.  
yes many times. my roommates were obsessed. personally, im not too into corn dusted bottoms of my pizza tho. michelle  
i think james is fairly untameable if i'm being honest  
usually i hold auditions. no real funny stories, but for the molly music video, we asked the girls about their last break up. and a few of the girls began to cry when talking about it. it was kind of funny.  
It's an Avalon; it'll never break down.  Source: Drove a '99 Avalon with 350,000 miles on it, now a 2007 Avalon with 200,000 miles on it. They run forever  
go watch again. no cuts. one take. im really out here  
Curiously, if they are just manipulating the end result, how would this be different than something like ad block? (In the sense that it is legal)  I ask this acknowledging I know next to nothing about these things.  
This is a tactic used by publishers to try and recoup money being lost to the used textbook market.  This ensures that even when students can benefit from selling to their classmates, that they can still get paid. 
Because just about anyone can get student loans to cover the cost of them. 
Re-posting this:  If your bookstore website ends in **Neebo.com**, **BKSTR.com**, or **BNCollege.com**, it should work.  We can try and support other sites, just let Ben (Ben@Texts.com) know.

As a college professor (math), what I do is simple: I don't require my students to purchase a textbook anymore. I teach the material in class, have students take notes, and provide them with ample sets of exercises with solutions. I also direct my students to some very good resources on the web and tell them to use the library and do some research if they have questions. I also strongly recommend that they study in small groups of 2-4 students.  I couldn't have done this at the beginning of my career, because I had little original material and didn't yet have my own ideas on how to teach the material, so the textbook was useful at the time, but after a while I noticed two things: 1) I started to deviate more and more from the textbook, and 2) very few students actually read the textbook. They used it for the exercises only. 
We will be doing this once we can nail it down in the USA. If we had more hands on deck, we would move on this sooner, but at the moment we need to be USA-centric.  I'm Canadian and went to college in New Brunswick, so supporting Canada is obviously something I want to do.  -Ben CTO Texts.com 
As an older student,  I had no idea about PB and their ilk.  Coughing up that much money for a book that I would use once opened me up to the idea of pirating anything for the first time.  Except for VHS movies.   Been doing that since the 80s. 
Yeah exactly. We are just delivering information to the user they could easily find themselves. The big companies would rather you be blindfolded. 
Ben and I are both 2012 grads, so we're definitely scratching our own itch here.  The dragon is a combo of textbook/bookstore behemoths, combined with student laziness.  We think that the Chrome Plugin in particular does a good job addressing both. 
Not the OP, but I can answer.   It's required due to the way the plugin works. Basically, when you go to the bookstore site, the browser requests the page, then the plugin reads the page, looking up the ISBN for the books, then modifies the page to include the price comparison element.   So reading and writing to pages you visit is necessary and pretty much the entire function of the plugin.  
My speculation is that there's just little (direct) incentive for professors / academic departments to take the risk on a new and unproven model.  As more and more schools take the plunge, there will be broader confidence and support for these efforts, which will act like a positive feedback loop of salvation. 
It is a fairly common practice to try to 'intimidate' your competitors especially those much smaller than you with legal threats, enough people will respond 'oh shit they're gonna get lawyers involved, I can't afford that, I'll do what they ask' to make it worth their while doing, after all it takes, what, thirty seconds to send out the email and if you comply then that was thirty seconds well spent. However if you know or look into the law and discover that their threats are farily empty they've only wasted thirty seconds.  
They have no argument, but literally no one can afford to go up in court against them. Their argument is "stop or we will sue you even if we lose".  
We have a few digital books but we need to add more support for this. It's in the oven. 
I would say Kevin Brady (R-TX) in charge of all tax issues (Chairman, Ways and Means)  and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) in charge of spending (Chairman, Appropriations) and I'll add the Chairman of my committee, the Rules Committee, Pete Sessions (R-TX) 
dunno. Markets are markets. I'm sure there will be some big players and some small players. We have to make sure that any laws and regs are easy for small players to navigate. There are lots of small liquor stores but also some chains it will probably be like that. 
I lived nearby your office last year and would frequently park in your lot on the weekends - 10/10 would vote for you again.

There is much more support when a representatives home state has moved forward with legalization. It's a theoretical issue if it's not happening at home. Now so many states have moved forward we have a lot more allies on both sides of the aisle. 
Congress could certainly pass a law that resembled the rule- but keep in mind this is the same Congress composed of people who overturned the rule so not likely. But yes, if members of Congress change their minds or a future election gives us a more privacy-minded Congress we can make broadband privacy the law of the land  
It really came to my attention then. I had read maybe an article about it and vaguely heard about it before, but then I had to spring into action when they surprised us and I'm so glad it worked (for now) 
haha, well you can consider me your honorary rep. There will be a new census in 2020 and redistricting, so you never know! Because CO has increased in population we will add a seat and therefore all districts will shrink. Even though the 2nd District will shrink, who knows maybe it will include all of Boulder County?   In any event, your district did have a wonderful Democratic Rep Betsy Markey for one term, 2008-2010 so it IS possible in the right year! 
On your second question, I think that most of the members are more friendly and informal with one another behind the scenes. If I had a problem with the Chair of my committee I would definitely approach them informally and see what's up.  
we've already created tens of thousands of jobs in Colorado! Growers, dispensaries, products, but it's also pumped money into alternative newspapers (ads) and real estate (leases). It's been good for our economy. 
Doing everything I can...  Today introduced CLIMATE Act along with several colleagues to prevent these new executive orders from being implemented. Of course it's more an effort to use our soapbox because obviously he wouldn't sign these bills even if they somehow passed. There might be some opportunities in tax reform too. The real battle will be to defend funding for EPA and renewable research, and then work hard to elect a Congress that cares more about the environment and climate issues. 
I want to see more data and information on it, it's an intriguing idea 
well I don't think that upstate NY will be added to my district anytime soon, but hey you never know! btw my mom is from Peekskill 
it's not enough $$$$  It is helping build and repair some schools though! 
don't love sandwiches, hold the bread. Or just bread and no sandwich also good. 
someone mentioned this earlier, a ballot initiative like California passed would take districting out of the hands of politicians and give it to a non-partisan commission, I think it would pass in most places it was put on the ballot.  Term limits, pros are you get new blood in and have more opportunities for people to use their real world skills and knowledge cons are that it makes lobbyists more powerful as they become the institutional memory and you also lose historical knowledge 
last year I didn't hit as well as usual (neither did our whole team, d*mn knuckleballs)...  We have begun baseball practice already and hope you can make it again this year. We practice most weekday mornings 7 am.  We recruit one another to play, no list to sign you just show up. 
we are trying to get clarity for kombucha, the FDA at times has threatened to regulate it like alcoholic beverages (which would make it much harder to buy and put many small companies out of business)! We have good bipartisan support and I think we can get our "fix" into the appropriate bill. There's a similar law already on the books regarding apple cider. It turns out that if you leave cider out it also ferments (duh) so they have a special exemption. I actually had to talk to a fermentation professor at CSU to explain all this to me to help craft the bill! 
also I'm Mr, not Mrs. but I'm flattered that my drag is so convincing. 
I spoke to Gardner last week, I'd say I speak to him about once/month.  Bennet sometimes I will speak with several times a week and other times it could go a month or more not seeing him or talking to him.  So on average Bennet once/week and Gardner once/month 
nothing planned right now but it would be fun to do again!  
Foco!Foco!Foco!Foco!Foco!Foco!Foco!Foco!  I think 4-6 hours/week fundraising is average for me 
well I think so many of us thought Trump couldn't win, but then he did :( I did go to PA to campaign for Hillary but I guess I could have done even more if I knew where it was headed.  I stay positive because I believe in this country and I know that things will swing back at some point to rationality. 
I think it's an interesting and responsible lifestyle, but it's also not for everyone. I don't know if it is a scaleable part of significantly reducing our carbon emissions. That being said I would support policies that make it easier for people to live off the grid if they want. 
I think the best effort would be to win an election for another pro net neutrality President and a pro net neutrality Congress.   There are legislative efforts to create some compromise laws around net neutrality but we have to be very careful about those.  I think as long as providers know that net neutrality could be around the corner, they will be discouraged from implementing complex tiering and pricing systems because of the uncertainty around them. 
1) I have no idea if Trump will last, it depends on what he actually did. There is a lot of smoke, we don't know if the Russian connection goes all the way to him or just a suspiciously high number of people around him. I do think that we will get to the bottom of it and if he committed an impeachable act he will be held accountable, but it could take time  2) all the calls and letters to reps have been helpful, peaceful marches too, but most importantly volunteer for good candidates and VOTE in 2018! If Democrats take the House back it's a different ball game entirely 
Well repealing the broadband privacy rule is the wrong direction. Also there are a lot of trojan horses in "cybersecurity" bills that could also impact privacy. I constantly watch and monitor those and work with Ds and Rs to defend privacy. I think a lot of reps don't understand the importance of privacy laws to the internet ecosystem and the jobs it creates as well as the services provided for all of us. 
Well somehow, 40% of the country thinks Trump is doing a great job and is not only right but is a terrific President. So I don't think special interests have bought off all those people, somehow they rationalize it in their minds.  
you would have to ask them. I think maybe they don't understand it, I have heard them call it a "government takeover of the internet"  
There are a TON of uses that are being looked at. One of the reasons I formed the BlockChain Caucus is to explore these opportunities. Obviously for land titling, medical records, personal records, and to enhance cyber security for geo-spatial data. The gov has a lot of big data stuff that would benefit from blockchain. We also have to make sure to "do no harm" to private sector deployment! 
I think it would have a pretty good chance of passing if it got on the ballot as an initiative! (that's how it passed in CA).  
1. I don't know, sometimes it seems like people are deliberately being stupid. I mean we all want the pipes to have a decent return on investment for the companies who connect us, but they don't get to own the internet  2) not unless you've done software dev work for me! 
well every Democrat just voted the other way on that so if it was a bribe it didn't work 
that's a good question... the main difference is that the consumer receives the zero-rated services for free, so if something wants to provide something that isn't the internet (like access to a proprietary network) for free and charge for internet access, I think that's probably ok. What do you think?  I try to think of the various use/abuse cases but would love more input on this. I don't want to discourage free services. 
mostly just laws and political change. Colorado showed that it can be done. Nothing is perfect but our regulations are much better than prohibition. 
I doubt it. I have a 2 year old and 5 year old and want them to have a somewhat normal childhood. 
Did a research paper in college on industrial hemp. Don't remember the racism part but the rest is definitely true.   
The precedent is prohibition (alcohol). There was a federal ban in our constitution. It was repealed.   Now alcohol regulations are in the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms which we would add marijuana too and it would be the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Marijuana 
there are times in winter that I think of it....  ;) 
no there is and should be a safe harbor for media- newspapers, books, etc. The restriction has to do with the the right of corporations to buy political ads directly for or against candidates.   Read what the opposite counsel said hopefully they refuted that? 
the best chance on these reform ideas is usually at the state ballot box through the initiative system for the 26 states that have it.   
I don't think that marijuana directly led to residential real estate price increases, but in general our economy is doing better and yes it's becoming hard to live most places like Boulder and Fort Collins in my district but also Denver. People have to move farther out to afford to live. There is no easy answer but I know our state legislature is considering some measures and local governments also have to make zoning and density decisions. 
I think if Ed runs there are a lot of great Dems in his district who would step up. No early favorite. Not evading or anything, it's just way too early to say.  I think 2018 is the time to finally win the 6th, hopefully we'll have a strong candidate up and going soon.  
Great to hear from you! Did you work with Gina at our office in Mapleton? or our Boulder office? I am sorry you weren't able to finish it. Hopefully we got to meet!  Young people need to get involved and vote. I hope that watching Trump is helping people of all ages (and young people) realize what's at stake. Some people avoid voting and say there aren't any differences... well there are HUGE differences and we're seeing that now.  
Could that be an insurance issue as well and not strictly a legal concern?  
Hasn't happened yet (that I'm aware of), but based on his remarks we are worried about it could happen any time 
I will encourage others to not be scared of reddit! 
We simply don't yet know how much we have to fear. Theoretically, the AG could have some kind of mass enforcement action and round up people who own or work in dispensaries in CO and even go after consumers!  I think if he does bad things it will likely be more subtle. But I am worried and that's why I'm working hard on this bill. It becomes more urgent if there is some kind of action he takes. Our legislators can pass a law like this, but Trump is President and would need to sign it (unless we have 2/3).  and thanks for the compliment on my clothes lol 
alcohol causes many more deaths than marijuana  we should have alcohol addiction treatment available, and marijuana addiction treatment too.  
Well maybe they have a different vision for our country. I sometimes ask myself the same question. Some are scared about not being re-nominated or elected by their party. But it's a better question to ask of them than me. There are only a two or three who are really nuts the rest seem pretty normal. 
I am surprised that you got a felony for simple possession of a few painkillers? Sounds harsh.   If you were prosecuted under state law, a governor can grant clemency. I don't think a mass one is likely but if you've been clean since with the law you can certainly apply for it with your governor's office.   I honestly don't think you have zero future in politics or government. Just be up front about your experience and talk about what you learned from it. It could make a compelling narrative if you run for office about how you want to reform drug laws.   
That is SO SO needed. I was in a green room recently with Bill Nye, and I realize how much I admire his outreach efforts. He went on a FoxNews show and they were just brutal to him and I realized why most scientists don't want to subject themselves to that crap.  And yes, for any science that is publicly funded, the studies should be made freely available. 
As someone who is both pro-guns and pro-marijuana, thank you for bringing this to my attention. Somehow it flew under my radar 
It's quite difficult getting the timing right. For a post to be shitty-able then it needs to be fairly recent (2 hours absolute tops) and also something I can paint. Any comments that imply a large quantity of something (an army of X, for example) are out of the question.  It usually takes about 5 minutes for the initial sketch, then a further 10 to go over it in ink, and  then another 15-20 to paint it. After scanning I crop and correct the colours/levels in photoshop and it's all finished in about 30-40 minutes.  The funny thing is that as I am more experienced, the paintings take longer because I pay more attention to details that I wouldn't be able to do beforehand. I also didn't used to use ink, and I didn't even wait for the paint to dry. Those were some truly shitty watercolours. 
Every now and then I get approached with an opportunity to paint, usually through a marketing firm, and it goes from there. It's very nice when people who I do work for enjoy my paintings who aren't from reddit, because to me it means they appreciate my ability aside from being known as shitty watercolour over here. Similarly they tend not to print my name beside what I do (for obvious reasons) and although it's a bit annoying, it's nice for the same reason. 
Sometimes I do work for companies that do not want to be associated with the word 'shitty', not surprisingly, and it has lost me work for big companies in the past. If I have to then I abbreviate to 'S. Watercolour', but I don't like that because it doesn't really mean anything. I might also transition to using my actual name, but it wont have the weight that 'shitty watercolour' does. 
I think I have him on Skype but we've only spoken once or twice, I don't really know him. 
*"Well, you see.. On the internet, I'm kind of a big deal"* 
The paintings were published through their social media accounts with no mention of my name (perhaps a cheeky S.W. in the corner). But it is quite fun seeing large companies begin their emails with 'Shitty,' 
Well, that's the big question. Whether painting is sustainable or just a fun thing that will eventually pass is not known to me. If it does continue, I'd love to do more work that gets published physically, it's a very rewarding feeling to have your artwork being printed to hold in your hands.  
howdy! When people send me commissions with all sorts of things in the background to make my life hard, like bicycles and chess boards and pianos.   The way I do my paintings (with ink outlines) means that there's a kind of binary of either drawing something properly or not at all. If I didn't use the ink then I might be able to abstract and draw, say, little blobs instead of a crowd of people.   And yes, I abandon things all the time. Either because it's a dumb idea or because I smudge it or something like this.   thanks for dropping by! 
There wasn't a definitive point where I was declared a professional artist. Jobs have come my way from early on, they tend to just be better ones now.   But it was a lot of work; if you were on reddit a few years ago then you probably saw me a lot. And my paintings weren't upvoted much so I painted a lot more than that still. I was spending almost every waking hour painting for months and months at a time, it was a bit insane.. 
I am jealous of the fact that he doesn't have to worry about ink or paint drying or correcting scans in photoshop. I could churn out a sketch every 10 minutes and it would be much simpler.   As far as his work, I hope this isn't mean but I prefer things with colour in them. B&W sketches don't stand out for me, but I admire how much work he's put in and hitting 1m karma.  
I'm afraid I can't remember, but it would have just been the first post that I came across.  
I practically lived there in first year! Will do, thanks :) 
On the Fox interview I did, they just put a massive *bleep* over any mention of my name, which was quite funny to watch afterwards 
I suppose it's the nature of freelance work, but the work is completely unpredictable across the year, which makes it hard to tell. I also don't particularly enjoy painting commissions because hardly anyone gets to see them and I don't get to decide what to paint. Also I'm a student at the moment.  
[](/hmmm) There really just needs to be a "Reddit book" where all the famous redditors join and contribute a few pages each. /u/Writes_Sci_Fi could write something SciFi-ey, /u/Unidan could contribute something awesome. /u/AWildSketchAppeared, and /u/Shitty_Watercolour could do some of the illustrations and /r/RedditMadeThisMovie could put out a Movie script. Throw in a slew of other users I can't remember right now and boom, a book! 
Sometimes it's a bit tedious starting the whole process again (sketch, ink, paint, waiting to dry in between, scanning, photoshop) but on the whole I don't get bored.   My favourite things to paint are natural things (animals, trees, etc) rather than artificial things (buildings, cars) because they look better in my style I think. 
It definitely fluctuates between loving it and sometimes hating it. There are days and weeks where I can't seem to make anything look good, and that really gets me down. But when I can pull it off, it is one of the most satisfying things. Glad you like them :) 
I used to get really nervous about sending people their commissioned portraits because I thought they might get offended. And then for some people you mess up the painting really badly and they're just cool about it because it's a 'shitty' watercolour, which is a nice perk of the job I guess 
I was declined from my first choice university but I currently study politics, philosophy, and economics elsewhere. And thank you very much for the kind words, I'm happy you like them :) 
I don't think I've seriously considered giving up, but the time pressures and occasional unhappiness with my work sometimes makes me question whether it's something that I will keep on doing. But so far that has been outweighed by the positivity from you guys :) 
1. Better  2. Watercolour is a bit of a tricky medium sometimes, especially when it comes to undoing mistakes (which I have quite a lot of), so I might try oil painting? Or maybe just stick to the ink lines and use crosshatching instead of paint. 
Legally speaking, the decision is limited to the Idaho statute, but this statute was part of a concerted nationwide effort to silence critics of animal agriculture, so its reverberations should be felt throughout the country.  We already have a case pending challenging Utah's Ag-Gag statute.  
This is a great question.  A lot of these workers are underpaid and exploited in their own way, so we shouldn't be shocked when they lash out in frustration, though of course it's horrible that the animals bear the brunt of it.  In my opinion, the real significance of these videos is not the discrete acts of animal cruelty they reveal (e.g. a worker punching a cow), but rather the kinds of routine, normal, commonplace animal suffering that pervades factory farming (e.g., confining animals in small cages, mutilating them without pain relief), or even things that are inherent in producing animal products (e.g., separating newborn calves from their bellowing mothers).   
We're working on it.  It's been slow and frustrating, but that's how the legal system works sometimes.   
Almost all meat, dairy and eggs come from factory farms, it's really hard to avoid it. When you buy those products you finance the factory farms directly. It would help a lot if you would stop buying animal products all together! Or you could eat a few plant based meals a week if you feel giving up all animal products is to daunting.  
The agribusiness industry spends a lot of money on lobbying.   
Well... Going vegetarian/vegan would be the most obvious.  
By taking action. When you move beyond simply bearing witness to suffering, and start to do something to change the conditions of the suffering, it becomes (slightly) more bearable. Also, I run, listen to music, and have a strong support network of friends and family who share my values. 
We don't have any indication one way or another, but the upside of an appeal is the opportunity to make precedent for the entire 9th circuit.  
Join Animal Equality, they do amazing work, check their website. They are big in Spain, UK and Germany that I know of. 
Write letters to the editor, raise awareness among your friends and neighbors, run for city council... 
No, just a few dirty looks at the court hearings.  
It's impossible to really estimate it accurately, but the case took a lot of time.  And because the defendant in the case was the Idaho attorney general, the taxpayers will have to foot the bill for this unconstitutional law.  It's unfortunate when the government wastes its citizens' money to defend a law designed to benefit a single industry.  
Good question. I'd like to hear alternative options for farming.  
I'm very passionate about it: the suffering of farmed animals is horrific and these efforts to hide it are unconscionable.  I also have friends who have conducted undercover investigations and the idea that these kind, compassionate people should be put in jail for their bravery is absurd.   
Yes, the industry thrives on secrecy and promotes false images of how animals are treated before becoming meat.  Whatever one's view on the ethics of eating animals, a robust and educated public debate can't take place without access to accurate information. 
If you feel this way, then let people schedule a visit to your farm. Put some cameras in the farm and stream it to the public 24/7. There could be no unfair spin on that. Then people will decide if they can stomach it.  
Ag-Gag laws criminalize photos and videos taken by people who have a right to be at the facility as employees.  Under the Idaho statute, a bona-fide employee could be sent to prison for a year for taking out his cell phone to document animal cruelty if he didn't ask his boss's permission first.   
Idaho could appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal (the federal circuit for the Western US), and then to the US Supreme Court.  For now, the decision is confined to Idaho as a matter of binding precedent, but the arguments should be equally persuasive in other states with Ag-Gag laws.  
Adopt a vegan diet and encourage your friends and families to do the same. 
Raising animals for meat or their products always involves a degree of animal abuse. 
Big agra is big business. Just like pharma companies contribute to the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  
The only way to ensure you are not supporting animal abuse is to go vegan. 
Very few fight for the unnamed behind closed doors. He seems to care enough to do so, so I'd imagine it's very rewarding. 
The ALDF are currently suing in Utah to overturn a similar law. They're way ahead of you. :-) 
Yes.  My dog is AWESOME!!!  ;)  As far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life I would say no.  The bullying was only on camera.  The minute the director yelled cut I was definitely one of the "in crowd".  lol  
I remember meeting you at Hedwig (great show by the way).    Because of the popularity of P&R it's changed many things in my life.  99% good...1% not so good.  I can honestly say that part of the 99% is the interaction I have with the fans.  I know a lot of actors aren't happy to stop and talk with their fans but I'm always happy to take pics and chat a little.  There were many MANY years as a working actor that nobody knew who the hell I was.  The fact that I was lucky enough to land a show like Parks and get to have an impact on peoples lives is something I will never take for granted.  I'm honored (and humbled) that people like my work and want to come up to let me know.  For those wondering what the 1% is that isn't so great...people sneaking pictures.  I would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it.  For some reason that seems much more invasive to me.  :) 
Missing P&R is something I will do the rest of my life.  I spent six years (7 seasons) with the greatest cast and crew that has ever been assembled (in my humble opinion).  Thankfully the cast are constantly texting each other and staying in touch.  I keep in touch with a lot of the crew too.  That being said...nothing will ever be like going to work every day to laugh with people you truly loved.  As far as people being different from their characters...As actors I think we all bring a certain part of ourselves to every role.  It's just natural.  Nick Offerman is a smart man who can build anything.  So that's like Ron.  On the other hand I think politically they might be at odds.   
Great question.  I've been blessed to have been working in this crazy business for over twenty years.  Because of the popularity of Parks I'll always be best known as Jerry which is a gift.  I love when I get to sink my teeth into a dramatic role.  Dark comedies are my favorites.  It's one of the things that led me to Middle Man.  I'm not the "funny" guy in the film yet I get a lot of laughs.  I love getting a new script and figuring out what I'm going to do with it.    As far as finding something I did in the past...hmmm...I did an episode of Diagnosis Murder where I got to play a crazed serial killer.  I had a lot of fun with that.  I would also check out a remake of Harvey I did many years ago with Leslie Nielsen, Swoosie Kurtz and Harry Anderson.  It was one of my first films.  I look like a baby.  It was an amazing experience.  :) 
Great question.  From what I understand one of the writers were standing next to me at the urinal and thought it was time to mix real life and TV life.  Made perfect sense to me.  lol  ;) 
They were all funny.  What a lot of people don't know is that after every scene we did a "fun run".  That's where we got to play around and do whatever we wanted while telling the same story that was on the page.  Most of us had an improv background so it made sense to let us play together.  We did that EVERY DAY.  I think it's one of the reasons we stayed so close as a cast.  That being said...Chris Pratt is so off the cuff funny that it's crazy.  Really really funny.  I had fun working with each and ever one of them.  That's not Hollywood bullshit.  I loved them all...and still do.  :) 
Thanks so much.  My dogs names are Chase (the white one) and Stella (the black one).  They're both rescues.  Last year I lost both of my other dogs to cancer.  I don't have kids so the dogs become like children (some people think that's crazy...that's OK).  When they passed away I didn't think I could ever go through it again.  After nine months my gut was telling me that it was time again.  I went to the Linda Blair World Heart Foundation and found Chase.  I knew within two minutes of meeting him that he needed to be with me for the rest of his life.  A few months later I went to the Amanda Foundation and met Stella.  She had obviously been abused and needed some loving.  They're brought the smile back to my face after losing my other two pups.  :) 
It's totally different than any other role I've played.  My character Lenny starts out in the same vein as Jerry from Parks.  A sweet, nice guy.  Unfortunately for Lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to Las Vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by Andrew J. West).  This turns his life upside down.  From that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude.  Playing the character was terrifying because if I didn't make it work the film doesn't work.  From what I hear I did it justice.  :) 
I love when I get to different types of characters.  That's what actors do.  Like I mentioned earlier it's hard not to be typecast but it's part of the challenge of being an actor.  :) 
I try to keep something from every shoot I'm on.  Most of it just sits in a box.  I figure someday when I'm old (well...older) I'll want to take a trip down memory lane.  I have the Jerry Gergich Conference Room RIP plaque on my desk.  I see it every day.  :) 
You nailed it.  Li'l Sebastian will be starring as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men".  Can't wait to see it.  :) 
Tell you dad thanks from me.  Without our Kickstarter campaign we would not have been able to make the film that we did.  I'm still blown away that strangers gave us their hard earned money to help us make our dream project.  It's very humbling.  I mentioned earlier that I have too many all time favorite actors to mention.  I'm been blessed by being around not only amazingly talented people but also amazing good people.  For me that's more important.  Getting to work with Andrew J. West, Josh McDermott and Anne Dudek on Middle Man was an unexpected treat.  I didn't know any of them and they came with their A games.  Really amazing people and actors.  :) 
I wouldn't say overly nice.  We were all just good friends doing good work and laughing our asses off every day.  :) 
My favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on Parks.  He had also worked on The Office.  His name is Dean Holland.  He really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us.  My favorite actor that I've worked with is too broad of a question.  I've fallen in love with so many people I've worked with over the years.  By "love" I mean I loved being around them.  :) 
LOL  That's a great analogy.  I'm not sure that's what I was thinking at the time but who knows?    As far as pulling classic Jerry moves....every day.  We all do.  I won an Emmy last month and as I was walking up the steps to get the award I just kept thinking "don't fall...don't fall". If I had fallen it would have been another "Jerry" moment that I would hear about forever even though I won the award for a different show.  lol  :) 
I've thought about this question many many times so credit for the question goes to me.  ;)  The answer is ... 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz.  :) 
I thank God every day that the acting thing worked out.  Otherwise I have no idea what I'd be doing.  I guess because I'm a talker and a bit gregarious that I could have gone into sales but honestly I don't know.  A lot of my family around me are in the trades...like pipe coverers and fitters.  I'm too damn uncoordinated and lazy to do that so again...THANK YOU GOD FOR LETTING THIS WORK OUT!!!!!  :) 
Totally thought up by Aubrey during the last commercial break.  My favorite part when watching the video is how the other cast members reacted when they realized what was happening.  Aubrey is a super funny person.  She knew it wouldn't be funny to make out with Pratt or Scott.  She knew it had to be with the old fat guy to get the real laugh.  I was happy to oblige.  :) 
The joke was funny but his laugh made it legendary 
I typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions".  ;) 
I think it's multiple reasons, including that one.  In season two, it's mentioned that he had plastic surgery, and he explains that it was in the wake of getting hit by a fire truck.  In season six, he tells Chris that he gained "a lot of sympathy weight" and that he used to look like Chris before he had kids.  So what this means is Gayle fell in love with a very different-looking person - a skinnier and probably better-looking pre-accident Gary, who still had a massive schlong, and probably still had his kind, gentle personality.  We see the photo album of the experiences he had with Gayle, and he mentions how much he valued going home to his family right at 5 - they built a solid foundation for their relationship, which means after all of what changed, she still loved him because they'd build such a strong marriage, and also because of his massive schlong. 
I've never been able to see if I have mumps.  When I go to look I'm always distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.  ;) 
Nothing but nature that night.  I didn't know that was going to happen.  Aubrey leaned over and said "you wanna make out during the Li'l Sebastian song".  Within .01 seconds I said yes.  As a guy who doesn't get roles as the romantic lead I listened to Rob Lowe's advice.  Just follow whatever the girl does.  So when we started kissing and I felt Aubrey tongue make its move I knew all bets were off.  lol  I'll be on Seth Meyers next Wednesday, June 14th.  Check it out.  Maybe Aubrey will surprise me and we'll make out again.  mmmm  ;) 
Thank you so much.  I love that scene too.  Any Jerry's on the crew?  YES!  Because I love them all so much I will not name names but I can tell you that there was the occasional mishap caused by the same person many times.  lol  Of course we still loved him.  :) 
I'm obviously not him but I think the show ended perfectly. I don't know if they can top that ending. 
My best bud was Retta (Donna).  Our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them.  Our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so I think that bonded us right off the bat.  We were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out.  I had lunch with Retta last week.  She's one of my favs in life.  :) 
HUGE Billy Joel Fan.  I was on a show yesterday talking about his song "My Life" as one of my all time favorites.  Billy tries to avoid me because of the Christie Brinkley issue.  He knows I could have taken her away from him.  EASY!  lol  ;) 
Awesome question.  Really something I've never thought about.  I would say that initially they would get along great.  They're both very devoted to family and inherently good people.  The journey that Lenny ends up on is not something Jerry would ever go along with so their friendship wouldn't last.  A night out for them would definitely involved a sundae.  :) 
Awesome question.  WOW!  I'm not sure which way to go.  On one had Pratt has turned himself into a physical machine.  On the other hand Nick is very smart and might be able to outmaneuver Chris.  Damn...I have to go with a draw.  :) 
DJ Roomba haunts my dreams.   I still wake up thinking I hear him coming down the hall.  Even talking about it now has me on edge.  ;) 
Mr. O'Heir?  Who the hell is that?  lol  Great question.  There's certainly a part of Jerry in Jim.  At least I hope so.  I think that Jerry is a very kind and caring person.  I would like to think that I have those attributes as well.  Unfortunately I don't have the temperament that Jerry has.  I can upset and people know it.  Jerry just seems to let it all roll off his shoulders.    I've always been a kind of people pleaser.  I'm not sure how healthy that is but it's who I am.  I've gotten better as I've gotten older which makes me happy but ultimately it's in my core to try and make people  feel comfortable...sometimes at my own expense.  Damn.  I need therapy NOW!  lol  ;) 
The Kardashian outtake is one of the funniest moments I've ever experience on any set ever.  Chris Pratt is so damn funny and he hits you with it when you least expect it.   For those who don't know what I'm talking about just go to You Tube and type in Parks and Rec and Kardashian.  You'll love it.  :) 
While I'm doing this REDDIT I've also been texting with the cast of P&R.  I have a Parks Fam text link on my phone.  We're always in contact whether it's to break balls or share what's going on with our lives.  The love you see on the screen only works because it was real off screen.  :) 
People always ask about regrets.  I don't think they're very healthy and certainly aren't going to help us today.  That being said...one of my regrets is not being involved in my high school theater department.  When I was a kid you were labeled depending on what you did or who you hang out with.  There were the burn outs, stoners, jocks, brains and a few others I'm probably forgetting.  In my day if you were part of the theater crowd you were known as a drama fag.  Unfortunately I let that term stop me from doing something that I probably would have loved.  Words are powerful and when you're young you don't realize that it just doesn't matter.  If I could go back to those days now knowing what I do I'd be happy to be called a drama fag.  :)  Tell them to work hard and enjoy every minute.  They will also make friendships that will last a lifetime.  :) 
The popular answer is going to be Offerman but IMO it's Aubrey Plaza. 
I have soooo many favorite episode of Parks.  The one I like to always mention is the season 2 episode called "The Hunting Trip".  I think it's one of my all time favs because it was the first time we were all out of the office together (other than April and Andy) and you got to see who we were in that world.  The scene where Donna (the awesome Retta) realizes her Mercedes has been shot is one of my all time favorite scenes of the whole series.    I also loved the Harvest Festival and the episode where Ben and Jerry had their day out together.  Ben had set up a special day for he and Leslie but she wasn't available.  He ended up doing everything with Jerry.  So damn funny.  I can honestly tell you that there is no least favorite episode that we shot.  Not trying to avoid the question...there just wasn't.  I have great memories of all of them.  :) 
Great question.  Mike Schur doesn't get talked about enough.  I can tell you that, in my opinion, Mike is a comic genius.  He knows what works and what doesn't.  We were lucky to have Mike with us throughout the run. Many times a show creator (runner) will leave after a show becomes successful because they'll be given other opportunities to start new projects.  Mike did start new projects (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) but never left us.  His voice is in every episode of P&R.  I think that's why the show never lost its strength.  Mike never handed us off to someone else.  Between him and Amy they were our fearless leaders and they took great care of us.  :) 
I love them too.  Thank you.  They love to roll and creative tons of dirt in my house. lol  When they play fight it gets so intense that sometimes I think they must have hurt each other.  They run at full speed and just smack into each other.  Two seconds later they do it again and their tales are wagging.  Crazy but so fun to watch.  They both love the dog park too.  And of course walks.  :) 
You saw me in Roseanne?  That's awesome.  Unfortunately I've never been on that show.  lol  But seriously, I used to watch Roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no.  You must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy.  ;)  As far as the reboot goes...I'm not sure.  Some things are better left alone.  :) 
Fart Attack is definitely classic.  I like the old school original with Mark Brandanowicz.  We were playing a game in the office that Jerry never wanted to play.  We had to dig dirt up on each other.  Jerry finally relents and says to Mark "I hear you've got two unpaid parking tickets" (big f'ing deal) and Mark says "I hear your adoptive mother smokes pot".  He looks at me and realizes he's hit a nerve.  He says "I'm sorry.  You didn't know your mom smoked pot?"  Jerry says..."I didn't know I was adopted".  The first and best burn for me.  :) 
There were so many outtakes that should NEVER see the light of day.  lol  We did some filthy silly stuff sometimes.  On the other hand we also all had our moments of brilliance when we were doing a fun run so I'm sure there's some stuff that I've forgotten that would have been fun to see in the show.  Ultimately our co creator Mike Schur always did what was best for the show.  He would never put in a guaranteed laugh if it didn't move the story forward. :) 
Aubrey and I dated for ten years before we eventually broke up due to a side relationship I was having with Joan Calamezzo.  It wasn't easy on any of us and I take full responsibility for the breakup.  That being said it didn't help with Aubrey started dating Joe from the Sewage Department.  That really hurt.  ;)  lol 
I just heard about that minutes ago.  I feel terrible.  She was a very very sweet lady.  For those who don't know Glenne played Ben's mother on Parks.  We had a lot of fun with her son set.  What a shame.  She was way too young.  :( 
Final seasons (and episodes) are tough.  I think the pressure to go out with an amazing story is tough to do.  I know I'm biased but I think that the writers at Parks nailed it.  I love the time jump and the fact that we get to see where these characters end up.  Some of my favorites shows didn't quite nail it for me but Parks did.  Again...I'm a bit biased.  lol  :) 
They had no choice. This was what they were ordered to do, and they studied so diligently because they were obedient. It is a culture where they have to listen to the authorities. But little by little, they would show some frustrations. They found it hard. Their dictionaries were outdated, which translated Korean words to English, and they didn't like to use English dictionaries for definition. They found different accents by the teachers (many were missionaries from deep South, with the Southern accent, or from New Zealand etc) difficult to understand. But these were just practical difficulties. Their real feelings about having to learn them? They couldn't really show it. They just felt worried that they were spending all their time learning English when their majors were within the field of science and technology 
There were so many things. They just learn totally upside down information about most things. But one thing I think most people do not realize is that they learn that South Korea & US attacked North Korea in 1950, and that North Korea won the war due to the bravery of their Great Leader Kim Il Sung. So they celebrate Victory Day, which is a huge holiday there. So this complete lie about the past then makes everything quite illogical. Because how do you then explain the fact that Korea is divided still, if actually North Korea "won" the war? One would have to question that strange logic, which they do not. So it's not so much that they get taught lies as education, but that that second step of questioning what does not make sense, in general, does not happen, not because they are stupid but because they are forbidden and also their intelligence is destroyed at young age. There were many many examples of such. 
I kept them all on USB sticks which I kept on my body at all times. I erased the trace off my computer every single time I signed off. I also created a document within a document so that my notes looked like a school material. I also created a back up copy on SD card which I hid in secret places in the dark, with the light off, just in case there were camera in the room. 
Hi, for now at least, I would not be allowed to go back, but more than that, even if I were allowed, which I could be in the future, I would probably not go because it would be too dangerous (in a different way than when I was there undercover for the book) and also because I would not feel that I would learn anything new, unless it could be under a different setting, which would be nearly impossible to find for the moment. And yes, there are more books at work:) Thanks for reading.   
Generally it's the same. Yes, the accent is different & they have some phrasings and words that are different or feel quite old fashioned or war-related vocabularies, but in general the difference is almost regional where one has that in South Korea from region to region also, but when you are talking about the basic exclamation you cite, (when bumping into things or surprised) they are pretty much not that different. 
Only those texts allowed in China. All that was pre-approved by the North Korean authority. I tried to install my own methods of essay writing and letter writing to investigate what they are really thinking, but that was not a part of the official text, but I insisted and got them approved by the North Korean authority called "counterpart". 
You know. . .I don't really know. I could give all the usual answers how I was so tortured by the injustice there -  which is true - and how I felt horrified watching so many separation that happened to families, including my own - which is also true. But the answer is a far more complicated one. So I recently wrote a long essay on this very topic for Lapham's Quarterly, which should be coming out any day now. So I will tweet that out when the piece comes out. I think it has something to do with fear. How that society is built on fear, and how fear can dictate us, and how we try to fight that fear in life. . .I know it's maybe a bit nonsensical in this AMA answer format, for which I apologyze. . .but the more accurate answer would be that I jumped in there because it was the most scary place in the world for me. . .if that makes any sense. 
The average citizen is unlikely to have any access to the "outside world" on a day-to-day basis. However there are smugglers that bring SD cards, CDs, etc. into the country with forbidden material on it such as western/south korean movies and kpop. 
I am always torn between the two genres. But if I really had to choose, I guess my heart is with fiction. But nonfiction makes my brains flow perhaps in a really exciting way. And my nonfiction in general is literary that I get my fiction angst/fill through that way. I don't know which I "like" writing better. Writing is so torturous for me that it's only after finishing it or nearing the end that I can enjoy it:) No, I do not consider myself a Korean-American literature writer. That genre is an odd one for fiction writers. I guess one cannot help that in coming up with genres, but especially fiction, to be limited by my nationality or immigration history is uncomfortable. I guess I just want to be a "writer", period. Yes, The Interpreter -- so many years later, I myself still have a real soft spot for Suzy Park, so thank you.  
I think the biggest misconception goes back to the basic premise. Most Americans have no idea why there are two Koreas, or why there are 30,000 US soldiers in South Korea and why North Korea hates America so much. That very basic fact has been sort of written out of the American consciousness. By repackaging the Korean War as a civil war, it has now created decades of a total misconception. The fact that the US had actually drawn the 38th Parallel that cut up the Korean peninsula, not in 1950 (the start of the war) but in 1945 at the liberation of Korea from Japan is something that no Korean has forgotten -- that was the beginning of the modern Korean tragedy. That the first Great Leader (the grandfather of the current Great Leader) was the creation of the Soviet Union (along with the US participation) is another horrible puzzle piece that Americans have conveniently forgotten. 
I dont know about cannabis, but I have heard from several sources that meth use is common as it is much cheaper than food, easing stomach pain from starvation, as well as provides energy for a long and tiring work day. I would also like to know the OPs comments on this and if its true.  
The whole idea for the literary nonfiction on North Korea came in February 2002 when I first went to Pyongyang for the 60th Birthday celebration of Kim Jong Il & wrote the NYRB cover essay. I realized then that an essay was just not enough, and there was just so much more I felt about this topic, also given my family background etc. From then on, it was trying to study the topic as thoroughly as I could, by literally researching it from afar and close, i.e. following defectors through the defection route, interviewing separated families, and situating myself in places where I could either go to North Korea or learn more in-depth stuff about it. Even my Fulbright research grant which allowed me to live in Seoul for 14 months in 2009 was for this book. As well as each visit that allowed me to get a different perspective. Understanding it from all sides was a key, and I felt that I had exhausted that by the time I lived there in 2011. So all in all, I would say about a decade.   
It was an unpaid job. I believe every teacher was sponsored by their church. There is not a danger in teaching in North Korea, but this is a gulag nation, and America is their enemy, and there is no diplomatic relations between them, so if you are a teacher from  the US, then, yes you are in danger, as evidenced by the recent hostage crisis where two American detained by North Korea (currently still held there) are from the university where I taught.  
There are Americans and other foreigners teaching English in the capital so I would think English is OK. Also, there is a lot of Western tourism that again requires English in the capital 
I wasn't there to teach, so that was not what I was looking for. My students were so busy, every hour of their day was mapped out, so it leaves no time for thinking. I found that world to be without hope. That does not mean that there is no joy in moments. There are because human beings are resilient, and my students were very, incredibly humane and lovely and their youthful spirit was sparklingly beautiful. But there was no real time for them to celebrate any of it. They would relax a bit but the immediately hauled off to their many duties that all had to do with regime & great leader. There was no hope there. So I wrote down what I saw. But I do not know about other teachers who were there to teach, but if you read my book, you will see that the other teachers weren't mostly there to teach but there as a part of their fundamental evangelical missionary purpose. 
I can answer this if you like. PFC - Pyongyangs answer to KFC. Was a nice break from the Kimchi. 
Learning the language of the enemy could probably get you recruited as a spy, allow you to do business overseas for the regime, etc. 
Since our videos are advertiser friendly, it hasn't hit us too hard directly.. but it was part of what prompted us to build Floatplane Club so that we and other creators would have ways to make money in the event that our adsense revenue got ripped away.. so it's definitely costing us money, but only because we're re-investing what we're making. 
Well I'm getting some now, so that should give you some idea :p 
Firetruck unboxing video. I wouldn't even hate it so much if it didn't have more views than all of the GOOD STUFF I've ever done.  If it didn't make so much money in adsense from 5 year olds just watching "the next suggested video about firetrucks" I'd pull it down. It's an embarrassment. 
I personally really like Kickfarted but not every kickstarter product we order is spectacularly bad enough to feature in the series, but we will probably revisit it.  
7 Gamers 1 CPU was one of the most exciting projects I've done. I'll always remember the moment it worked as one of the highlights of my career.  That's really where I get off - spending a TON of time on something, not being sure that it's going to work, and then seeing the end result be awesome.  Scrapyard Wars Season 1 will also hold a special place in my heart forever. That was where we began experimenting with the idea of being a "Tech Top Gear" rather than just a review channel and that path we took continues to shape our content (even our reviews which contain more personalities and funny stuff and more little sketches than ever) to this day. 
This.  I found it really jarring in the final episode of the last season where you had the team talking about finishing their benchmarks and then instantly it changes frames completley and Jay is starting to review them. Then after about 5mins the winner was decided and it was over.   Seems a real shame to have this 3hour or so build up, only to have the big reveal over in about 10mins.  
Yeah Dennis and I were both really pleased with it. 
Probably at some point and so much has changed so there is a lot to show :)  
He wants to make this stupid nonsensical movie that is just actually dumb. This was an idea he had 5 years ago and he still wants to do it.  Super cheese fest with stupid techy nerdy junk. 
I think Berkel holds the record for most expensive stuff broken... He got out of his chair, which caused the air shock to spring up, knocking over a 34" LG Ultrawide back when they were brand new (about $1500US iirc).  I was also (somewhat) responsible for taking our Sony FS700 out for a shoot in the rain (Brandon LET me do it, so it's partly on him). It didn't work for a few days and we had to disassemble it to the greatest degree we could to dry it out.. Scary times. That was in the early days when we couldn't have afforded to replace it :p 
Yes. I highly recommended Linus brand cable ties. They are available in any colour and style you want as long as you want orange with my face on it. 
So when Luke, Linus, and I would drive from NCIX late at night on Fridays (we would carpool) the conversations ALWAYS went:  1) Are we friends? 2) Linus Media Group is a stupid company name.  This went on for a few months, without fail. 
TV.  Or I guess our own platform, Float Plane Club. 
reading positive, supportive comments like this one.  I also love spending time reading stories to my kids and playing with them and playing badminton. 
Being up in Western Canada makes collaboration a little tougher.. and I'm pretty asocial by nature so I haven't generally gone out of my way to "collab" - especially because many collabs are just blatant subscriber swaps  "hey sub to me and sub to him/her and get a chance to win"  But I've also known a lot of the people in the tech tuber scene for YEARS and really enjoy spending time with them. So it's nice to have an excuse to hang out and make a video.  I'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though. 
Eventually, and completely. It will be it's own building.  
Depends how the first one goes.   If we lose buckets of money, then no.  If we lose a little bit of money, then probably.  If we break even or make money, then GAME ON! 
I WANT THE WIRELESS LOGITECH MICE. DO YOU HEAR ME, LOGITECH? GIVE THEM TO ME. 
We will be making a video about that very soon :P  
My favorite camera currently is my Fuji XT-2, IMHO its the best stills camera I have had the pleasure of using day to day  
I prefer 'guided' where you have an arc planned out and you have the meat of what you want to say written but it's not word for word  
I suck at it :p  But seriously, I have no social life, so it's just work/family, which makes it a bit easier. I get one night a week to go out and play badminton and other than that I go home and spend time wiht the kids. I've also SIGNIFICANTLY cut back on the time I spend working on the weekends. So it's not too bad at this point. 
I want to make a movie trailer.  Not a movie.  Just a trailer.  But with BADASS high production values so it would be a TON of fun to shoot. It'd be basically a bunch of sketches back to back without having to deal with the boring parts of making a movie like real dialogue and a story arc and character development.  I just can't figure out how to fund it other than stealing $100,000+ from the LMG coffers and putting it in a firepit... 
It's not that I'm not spending time making content, it's just that I'm involved in OVERSEEING the process rather than actually DOING it.  
For most of us at the start, it took a lot of hours, low pay (so Linus could afford to keep us going), and corner cutting. Actually, it sounds like not much has changed. Nevermind.  For my hire so far, and the people I hire in the future, I don't really hold chasing fame against them. Motivation is motivation. 
I am, I've been very busy with other projects and there are a lot of windows only apps that I need so I will likely be splitting my system in half with unraid.  
one of them is literally fused in there.. I"d have to cut it off. So... no... 
LOTS of things... If I ever stop making tech videos, you'll see them. 
Ehhhh kinda but it's easy to regret things with a project like scrapyard wars. Its an insane wrap up of rapid fire decision making and prioritisation. By design not everything will go perfectly.  
I'm trying to make sure that they don't. =) That's my job. 
They are Maxine's nails she is the newest shooter on the team  
'We're a media company that makes videos for the Internet'  
That's actually the sentiment every year when looking back. 
I want the NVIDIA Shield Portable to get updated. It's frickin awesome.  As for tech that needs to stop.. Fitness trackers need to stop or start being accurate. As it is now they're just jewelry imo. 
They were broken down and put in the pile. A lot of the stuff is engineering samples so we can't sell it or give it away, but it's still functional so maybe we'll find a use for it. 
No. I am seriously considering going to school part time for project management however.  
EveryFrameAPainting, WiseCrack, Nerdwriter1, Philip Defranco I have a huge respect for all those guys.  
It's growing much faster than expected, I'll still be around tho!  
No plans. Trying to recreate the magic of an earlier video by making it again is rarely a successful formula. 
t'would be lit af, but no plans for that at the moment. I don't want to mess with the purity of Nicky V's vision 
I get to smell him on a daily basis. Sometimes he doesn't notice and sometimes he just pretends not to notice.   So far, the same amount. XD Things don't get easier, we just try to do more/different things  
They can call it "Linux with Linus (but not THAT Linus)"  
There are positives and negatives to both but ultimately where we are now IMO is better than its ever been in many ways.  
Put all my parts under mineral oil then it failed to post. I fixed it.. But Damn..  
Its dope, they do a lot really cool stuff with blocking and composition and I liked that they try to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality.  
He doesn't really wanna answer our stupid questions 
New shows and ideas are a constant thing that we think about so always looking to do new challenging ideas. Keeps life interesting  
Knowing Linus they will be able to go down whatever path they want and he will support them ferociously.. As long as it's productive, has any possibility to succeed.. And isn't being a stripper.  
Tech for the sake of tech is lame.  I kid. Gaming is awesome. 
HELLO FRIEND.   It doesn't offer nearly the range of capabilities that we plan to offer. This is the short and simple answer. FPC isn't just early access video. More will be clear on launch. :D 
The end game is to make videos with people I love working with.  And no I want NOTHING TO DO with physical inventory. I played that game. It's no fun. 
Tech is great that way. There's always something new - sometimes great and sometimes terrible - to get excited about or crap on. We're really lucky to have so much inspiration. 
Actually quite a lot. If someone here feels strongly enough about an idea it will be questioned and examined but generally if they persist they will be allowed to do it.. Thing is I'd the audience doesn't get on board  fairly strongly you'll just never be able to do it again. Which is fair. Its actually quite a lot of freedom, ive taken advantage of it a lot and don't take it for granted.   
I have a video review on the RED 8K Helium cameras that we got, should be on its way mid July  
Infrastructure is doing very well. Design and front end Dev is not. We are quite a few months from launch because of this.  
Very sobering.  "Oh wow my life has changed".  I had to sit down and think about what my life would be like going forward.    I am responsible, to a large extent, for the success of the NERF dart gun line.   Yes 
High performance dart guns were originally based on my patents.  I hold them in high regard. I'm a nuclear engineer, and engineers aren't known for their humor. 
I went and gave a talk at a school, years ago, after the Super Soaker first came out.  I told them that I had invented it, and they didn't believe me.  I left the school with them never really accepting the idea that I had invented the water gun. 
Backpack tanks or hose attachments might be the peak 
Jammin' Jet.  It was commercialized.  It was a water propelled airplane that was pumped just like a Super Soaker with water shooting out the back, propelling it into flight.  The manufacturer changed the design of the plane to fly in a circle, but didn't adjust the wings so as it turned it would roll and dive into the ground.  Usually causing the plane to break after the first launch.  Exciting toy, exciting commercial, disappointing in the end. 
I got the idea in '82, had a number of false starts, and it wasn't until '89 that I made the presentation to Larami.  It was on the market a year later in 1990 as the "Power Drencher".  We changed the name in '91 to Super Soaker and because of the consistent sales success in both years by word of mouth, Larami decided to run TV commercials. In 1992 it became the number 1 selling toy in the world. 
Your friend sounds like a douche lol. Always gotta 1-up, huh? Supersoaker was pay2win lol  
I wouldn't phrase it that way.  I would phrase it as hard-ball, hardcore business. One would like to see businesses operate more on principle as opposed to what they can get away with legally. 
I have worked with and been funded by the Department of Defense in the past for my inventions. It's probably better that I not comment on the specifics of those contracts however. 
I went to the toy store one day and saw a number of guns being sold under the N-Strike name, and my royalty check did not reflect the number of guns I saw in the store. I took out my contract and did a close review.  Inventing energy converting technology and batteries that will be 2x better than lithium ion. 
Having high pressure and a relatively large nozzle.  However, as you go to higher pressure and the water comes out faster, the stream breaks up in the air and limits how much further the water travels.  There's an optimum combination of pressure and nozzle size. 
I once used a Super Soaker to unclog a plugged up water drain at my home. 
I wanted to be an engineer long before I knew that "engineer" was the term that described what I wanted to do.  I was tinkering as a little kid.  Always curious about the way things worked. Since that time, what I've done has been to be persistent.  So perseverance and continuing to hone your skills is the key to being successful in anything you do. 
The monster was the largest gun that Larami produced.  It was very badass in its look.  But the seals around the nozzle had manufacturing defects that were not corrected, and it did not deliver on the promise that the appearance presented. It was a dual nozzle version of the CPS 2500, and would've been great if it worked as well as the 2500. 
I have in the past.  We used to routinely get them when we were focused on improving them and redesigning them.  But at this point in time I'm not really active in that sector. 
I really appreciate the compliments people give about the water gun. It makes me want to do more to improve quality of life.  I'm hopeful that my new technologies will help improve more lives.  In fact, the heat pump that I was working on when I got the idea for the Super Soaker was being made to address an environmental problem. 
Yes and no.  I do have a display of Super Soakers and I have a display of prototypes we built over the years.  My collection is not complete, there are some that got away.  Periodically I'll go on ebay to find ones out of production, and some are stored away to protect them. The room in the background of my proof picture is the prototype "museum" we have at my laboratory. 
When I made the Super Soaker I was trying to make a high performance water gun.  The desire to make a high performance water gun occurred when I was shooting a stream of water from a nozzle I hooked to a bathroom sink while working on an air conditioner that would use water as a coolant instead of Freon. 
I have an invention on the Galileo spacecraft which went to Jupiter, and my fellow engineers at JPL were skeptical that it would successfully solve the problem we ran into.  It went to Jupiter in support of a very successful mission. I also invented an engine that converts heat into electricity more efficiently than perhaps any other engine and it has no moving mechanical parts. Super Soaker remains what I am most known for. I am confident that history will be kind to me. 
That never occurred to me that people would do that with a water gun, but my philosophy is that everyone is an inventor.  Everyone has creative ideas, and hopefully most of them are productive. 
I could be wrong.  It'll stick around, but I suspect it'll go the way of the hula hoop. 
Yes.  Eventually JTEC technology will mature and become widely used. The nuclear community is very conservative with respect to implementing new technology and want to rely on the tried and true.  But eventually the performance of the JTEC will warrant its use in nuclear applications. 
One of the keys to success is realizing that there are many things that can go wrong with a given idea, but my strategy has been to develop multiple inventions to put the odds in my favor. Also to persevere.  It's important to know when to quit, I'm just not very good at it. 
I knew it would be successful because I knew it was a fun toy, but I didn't anticipate it to be a number 1 toy in the world.  That's not something one can predict. 
I had one that would be a great Super Soaker in a water war. It was a rapid refill model that when you ran out of water you put the nozzle up directly to a water source and it refilled your gun automatically. 
I was designing space craft before I was designing Super Soakers. That being said, when you present a really innovative idea the general reaction is usually skepticism if it is something they are not familiar with or have seen before.  People don't usually accept radically new ideas readily. 
The Super Soaker and NERF allowed me to pursue the other projects that I'm working on.  
First off, you can't make money unless someone knows about it.  Secondly, I was willing to put my idea out there and to lose as long as I learned from the experience. I felt that subsequent ideas I had I would be able to use that experience to become successful. 
No.  I asked for $50s and $100s only.  Everything I'd understood about bait money was that they only came in $20s, so nothing to worry about there if you specifically demand the other non-$20 denominations.  And I wasn't worried anyone would see me getting into my vehicle because I parked out of view (i.e., on the other side of another building). 
I didn't tell my wife or my best friend or anyone.  I didn't want to burden either of them with that.  But that's not the real reason I didn't tell them.  I just know that your chances of getting caught skyrocket when you start blathering on about it to others.  I didn't feel like it was a dirty secret either.  It was just one of those things that I did every now and then.  I'm a private person, so it didn't bother me keeping it to myself. 
Not a lot.  The most I got from a single robbery was maybe $7k. 
I put a lot of thought and planning into the first one.  I probably spent five months obsessing over all of the details, possibilities, etc.  Once I got the nerve to finally give it a go and everything worked as planned, it was pretty much copy-and-paste from then on.  I didn't scout banks, per se, but I did have an idea of what I was looking for.  I didn't want to hit a stand alone bank.  I wanted to be able to park my vehicle within walking distance yet out of sight from the bank (i.e., on the other side of an adjacent building).  As for the best times, I usually opted for some time around 3pm since I figured that's when shift-change would likely be for the local police. 
So my first AMA pretty much went viral and a gazillion people reached out to me for this very thing.  I ended up meeting a really great producer who is doing a documentary type film, and I can't wait to see what he does with it.  I don't know that I'm at liberty to say much about it, but he is awesome and I'm glad I met him.  Hopefully will have some news on that soon. 
My 10 y/o self was trying to cope with his parents divorcing and not understanding how to fit in at school.  He wouldn't have listened to a damn thing I said anyway and probably would have done the exact opposite anyway.  More than anything, I think I'd just tell him to hang in there and things won't be bad forever.  I'd tell him that his parents still loved him even if they didn't always know how to show it, and I'd challenge him to actually try to appreciate school instead of trying to make it hell on every teacher in his path.  10 y/o kids don't have a fucking clue in life and are in that really awkward phase of *too young to care for themselves* and *too old to have everything done for them*.  I'd probably tell him to become a hacker. 
First of all, I am standing up while typing this and there's nothing you can do to stop me.  Nah, I can't imagine ever wanting to do that shit again.  I like my life, and I'm happy.  That's something I never had for the first few decades of my life.  There's just no appeal to do certain things as you get older and for me, this falls into that category. 
This is a fun conversation to have, and I actually will have a really cool opportunity to go to an event later this year and talk with banking professionals about it.  I'm excited.  Cameras are a shit ton better today than they were in 2006.  Plus, we have social media in a way that only existed in our worst nightmares back then.  It's a lot different these days.  With that said, it's still just not really that big of a priority for banks to catch robbers.  They're not really losing *that* much money to robberies.  If you do it how I was doing it, you're not going to really raise any eyebrows.  On the other hand, if you're going in guns blazing and wrecking shop, they're going to put a lot more of their resources into catching you...  ...because if you hurt a customer during a robbery, that's going to cost WAY more money than a few thousand dollars from Teller B.  And I agree with your last sentence. 
Depending on which type of table you're talking about, it could be as simple as opening up the table and getting it out with your hand.  Most coin-operated tables that you find in bars/pubs/whatever have a split-cabinet design so the owner can open it up and remove the coin box.  If you're talking about a home model that doesn't have a split-cabinet design, it's going to probably be a pain in the ass. 
I never really felt like I was looking over my shoulder.  That feeling usually only lasted an hour or two after the robbery, but it was pretty...I dunno...whatever a drug does to you is what it did to me.  But as with drugs, it wears of more quickly each time as you build tolerance to it.  I didn't really feel like I was living on the edge.  It was exciting, but it never lasted. 
Damn right, it is.  And not just because of the crime, but just because of being a felon in general.  Although it's technically illegal to discriminate based on that, companies aren't so quick to hire an ex-con.  Thankfully, it's still America and there's always opportunity if you try hard enough.  No complaints from me. 
I stuffed a rag into the drain of their sinks and turned on the faucet so the house would flood.  Other than that, no. 
If I saw an officer of any kind, third party or not, there's no way I was sticking around to rob the place.  So your presence alone can prevent a certain amount of crimes, I'm sure.  The downside is the people who don't care you're there also do not care if they have to hurt you.  At a glance, I think your comment kind of sounds like you're probably in the wrong business.  That sounds so stressful. 
I think about some of the tellers often.  I don't really know what I feel about them, but I do hope they don't have any kind of PTSD or other resulting issues.  And if they ever wanted to get me in a room with mediators or whatever and give me a piece of their mind or whatever other things they needed to do, I wouldn't be against that.  I guess the answer to your question is no, I don't feel guilty.  But I don't feel the opposite of guilty either.  I just don't feel a lot on certain topics.  I don't know what I would even do with those feelings.  I'm open to suggestions. 
Probably.  I don't know.  I don't think I'd want anything to do with that crowd. 
I've never seen that movie, but generally speaking, Hollywood tends to really get bank robbery wrong.  Granted, if they painted a more accurate picture of bank robbery, it would be terribly boring and nothing people would want to pay to see.  Hollywood portrays bank robbery about like the porn industry portrays sex. 
My sentence was 36 months.  I served 39 months because I didn't get credit for all of my county time.  I think you misread the proof.  The crime carries *up to* 20 years, but that wasn't my sentence. 
She was terrible.  She's one of the few people I mentioned by name in my book.  She was just a terrible, terrible person. 
I graduated high school and never went to college.  That was about eight years before the crime stuff.  I think there are lots of things that could have changed my path somewhere along the way, but it's hard to say exactly what they might have been.  As a parent (especially knowing my own history), this is something I think about constantly, and I wish I had a better answer for you. 
I do think about the tellers.  There's not really much I can do about the impact my choices had in their lives, but I'm open to anything that would be productive in the matter.  I hate to admit it, but I really just don't feel a lot of remorse.  In a lot of ways, I've grown a bit detached from who I was back then, so perhaps there's some denial at play (or some other kind of psychological explanation), but I do think about those folks and if there's anything I could ever do to resolve any issues that arose from what I did. 
I was expecting more like a decade or so.  I wasn't really sure, but I definitely expected way more than three years. 
Only problem would be if it got on news it never did.  He would watch his back for couple hours, after that he would relax until next robbery. 
No, it never happened.  And I don't really know what I would have done.  I probably would've just been like *Ah bummer...ok, ttyl.* 
I don't fully know how to answer it.  To me, it's like asking someone why they prefer mustard over ketchup.  I just don't like mustard, I guess, but I can't explain why.  I just don't like how it feels in my mouth.  To me, there's a certain *icky* feeling about selling drugs, stealing cars, robbing convenience stores, or any other crime.  Also, I knew how banks worked.  I knew their procedures during a robbery, so I was just more comfortable with the thought of doing that instead. 
I don't think anyone was in shock.  I don't think anyone predicted or anything like that, but I don't think there's many things I could do that would raise the eyebrows of those who know me best.  I guess I could be tried for other robberies.  But then again, so could you.  That's pretty much the level of risk I'm at by now.  It's been 10 years.  It's all good.  Thanks for the well wishes.  :) 
I was too lost in my own spiral to really worry about jail.  But yeah, most of the fears people have about jail/prison are pretty comical once you've done time. 
he said the banks never pursued him because they didnt lose much money and because no one was threatened  
Inmates are damaged long before they're incarcerated.  It's not normal for mentally healthy, functional people to do things that land them in prison.  So just understand that the people you'll see have pasts long before the crimes they're doing time for.  People in our culture forget that criminals aren't just born.  Nobody pops out of their mom and is immediately bad.  Things happen somewhere along the way that help shape them, for better or worse, into the person they become.  For balance, I'll say that it's also important to not simply have sympathy for inmates and only focus on the terrible upbringings they may have had.  You have to be able to simultaneously see them for who they are, what they've done, but also where they come from.  Prison is a dark place.  There are some things you just can't prepare for.  Just don't forget that everybody has a story.  And with some of those people, you hear their story and can't help but think *My god, no wonder you ended up here.* 
Dave is the coolest dude ever.  Seriously.  I'll box someone for talking shit about Dave because the dude is just really exactly the same guy off air as he is on air.  He ain't just putting on a show.  He's the real deal, just another redneck who cares and happens to have a lot of money too. 
u/Ninjaassassinguy is correct.  I don't really know what they could have done to spoil my plans aside from things that were out of line with what they were trained to do. 
How dare you try to trick me into finishing my 4th grade homework.   ^^And ^^sorry, ^^but ^^I ^^have  ^^no ^^idea.   ^^Definitely ^^less ^^than ^^minimum ^^wage ^^though. 
Nope.  I don't think I've ever been above the third story of any building in Austin. 
Hell if I know.  I think my only realistic choice at that point would be to leave. 
No, I don't think it's a gateway crime.  It's probably near the end of the list of things criminals want to do but are too scared to try, for whatever reason. 
Because its easier to give money to him than take a risk and have guy runing around bank with weapon. 
I don't think I'd have been alive much longer.  I was really in an bad place mentally and emotionally, and I didn't have that give-a-damn thing that makes you avoid really bad choices.  I don't think I'd have taken myself out intentionally, but I wasn't really making decisions based on my well-being. 
The grand heist is sneaking an extra house or two onto a lot. 
While the media goes off on the idiot Trump-Russia witch hunt, the real damage is quietly happening on this front.  The enduring, horrible legacy of Trump will be the dissolution of public land and monuments.   Forget the Russia tangent; if you push too hard, the right will bring up the bribes by the Russians to the Clinton Foundation  
**THIS**, so much this.  Toured up the West Coast with open roads through all the Federal lands and beachfront with nary a sign of barbwire or private properties for hundreds of miles!!  What, you mean just pull off the road and camp on a beach like it's your own back yard?  Exactly like that, and it's like nothing else I've experienced.  Freedom exemplified.  East coast touring, not so much.  In fact, not even close.  Hundreds of miles of barbed wire, pastures,  no trespassing signs, paid lodgings, lakes, grounds, everything privately owned/pay to stay and keep on moving to the next hotel.  Truly two very different sides of a single coin. 
Sounds to me like it might just be good old fashioned nepotism?   As a kid I worked 2 or 3 weekends a month on a small Colorado ranch. We neighbored a dude ranch that owned a small acreage surrounded by NFS land. Accessible only by NFS roads. The NFS land was considered some of the best hunting in the area.   Because the dude ranch was in good with the local ranger they got him to close off all the roads and give them a key. Officially it was to "prevent erroision" but everyone knew it was a favor to give the side ranch private access and hunting.   I will say this was the exception. Most of the management done was honest. One bad ranger in charge of this area...  
I would like an answer on this as I have mixed feelings about it.  On paper I think it's awesome. But atleast in my part of the country it seems like everywhere is cultural, spiritual, or historical to native tribes. Its not just like an acre where they buried their dead. Its chunks of huge square miles. 
Sure!  Just outbid the companies looking for the raw resources.  But seriously, the selloffs happen in huge parcels that are open to anyone.  Most people just don't hear about it because they don't go looking. 
Good question. Groups that back land transfer, like the American Lands Council and the Mountain States Legal Foundation, have received funding from industry groups. MSLF has received money from Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, U.S. Steel, the Coors foundation and ExxonMobil. The American Lands Council, which has employed Utah state rep Ken Ivory, has received funding from fossil fuel interest/Koch-backed ALEC and Americans for Prosperity.  
The federal government isn't requisitioning these lands, these are lands that for the most part were never claimed during the Homestead Act and never left the possession of the federal government   
Hey! I'd love to hear more about the eminent domain issues where you live. If it's about federal mismanagement of land, we might cover it in this series. If it's a national story but not right for this series, I'll pass it along to another editor. Thanks for your time! [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com 
Cleats, for sure. Who doesn't want to be The Flash? 
Seems sort of futile to me, aren't Republicans against Federally owned anything? 
You need to include ranchers in that. They're a big, big part of it. 
Learning a little about drilling operations would be a good first step in understand what actually goes on in the aftermath. Even the terrifying looking oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada look roughly the same post production. From the wells I've been part of, the impact is negligible. The process of selling mineral rights to private oil companies and the like has been going on in Texas for years. It's really not as terrible as this man would suggest. If you'd like the basics "A Primer of Oilwell Drilling: A Basic Text of Oil and Gas Drilling" is a reasonable place to start. I know I'll get downvoted for saying this.  
You would need millions to buy a national park plus the money for upkeep. 
The biggest reason against the states controlling public lands at home is the cost, and the reason that 70% of previously transferred public lands have been privatized is all about money. States aren't supposed to run a budget deficit like the federal government does, and when the cost of fighting fires and maintaining public land gets too high, the state sells thousands of acres to private interests to ease that financial burden. /u/Caty_Enders may be able to speak to that a little better, though.  
Hey, thanks for this! On my way out, but this is a question that I answered more fully in a few other responses. In brief: Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and the Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Partnership have made a huge impact this spring 
Budget.  States have budgets to keep to (so do the federal government, obviously), so a "good" way to do that is to sell off the land to private ownership, which is what has happened to the vast majority of the federal land that has been transferred to the states.  
Side note, I misunderstood until I read your twitter feed. Unless I didn't. So to add another question to the mix, who is this land going to? Where is it coming from? Aka is it Public parks people use and enjoy, or just unused, undeveloped, unknown? 
Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2   it's in the constitution, also Kleppe vs. New Mexico for the Supreme Court's opinion on it 
Hey, thanks for reaching out. If you'd like to chat, you can reach me at [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com 
Jus to note, it wouldn't giving that land back to the states.  Federal land in the West with few exceptions never belonged to states in the first place 
Federal land = purchased by the federal government, and usually managed through BLM or the National Parks Service. State land = purchased by state governments or gifted to them by the federal. As enshrined in the Constitution, the power of the federal government supersedes that of state governments. States should certainly have the power to decide what to do with the lands that they own, but the federal government has the power to decide what to do with the land that they in turn own. I'm addition, if a state is mismanaging its lands in a way that is to the detriment of multiple states (for example, pollution that runs through rivers to other states), it's the federal government's responsibility to step in and protect these lands, in order to make the will of people in outside states that are being affected known. 
is it even remotely possible for any intelligent human being to not have a personal agenda on saving the planet ? including our protected lands?    i mean.......? 
The problem with local governments owning these vast tracts of land is mainly that they cannot afford it, so after a few years they sell it off.  
Because it takes away a lot of public space that's enjoyable in its own way. There's a lot of unique land rivaling the national parks out west that could be forever lost to private interests and blocked off with"no trespassing" signs. 
Those lands are the property of the federal government, which it acts as an environmental steward over, why would it give up property to the states 
We saw a bunch of fish that I had no idea what they were! We also saw some whales. The first time we saw a whale we rowed in circles for half a day trying to follow it and get a picture.  
It is absolutely the most amazing thing you can ever see. The stars were so bright and numerous that I would just stare until my neck started to hurt. We also rowed through bio-luminescent plankton which was mindbogglingly beautiful.  
It was not fun..I did try to swim after each shift so I could at least get some of the sweat off! I also washed my clothes a couple times a week with freshwater so they wouldn't get crunchy.  The first shower on land was pretty amazing! 
When we found out the storm was coming we tried to row as far south as possible to miss the worst of it. Once the wind was strong enough in the wrong direction that we were not making any progress we deployed our sea anchor. A sea anchor, or para anchor, is basically a parachute with a hole in the top. You put it out in the water and it hovers ~50-75 ft away from you below the surface. It keeps you perpendicular with the waves so you are less likely to roll and it also slows down your drift. Once we did that we hunkered down in the cabins until the storm passed! 
The hardest part was when we got caught in weird currents and would row as hard as we could and get pushed backwards. It happened when we were only about 400 miles from the finish line! We were so close to being done but we just couldn't move!  We had one tropical storm hit us that turned into a hurricane! It was scary not having weather radar because we really didn't know what to expect. We had a satellite phone so people gave us weather updates but we really just had to wait and see what happened. it ended up not being that bad but it was a little scary.  
Our boat had 2 emergency EPIRBS and our lift raft had 1. The race made sure that we had all of the safety equipment and training we needed! 
Honestly I don't think it really sunk in until we lost sight of land. That was when it finally felt real. Then we just kept rowing until we saw land again! There were some times that rowing got really tough and I just wanted to be done. We hit a weird current that was pushing us back East and we would row for 24 hours and stay in the same spot or lose a couple of miles. It was really frustrating!  
Since it was a race there is a sailboat that tries to sail around the entire fleet in case someone needs help. Luckily we never needed any help. If you get assistance of any kind you are disqualified from the race. I didn't think I was weird after the row but my family and friends said I was really spacey. They said it was hard to carry on a conversation with me because I would just start daydreaming.  
We rowed 3 hours on 3 hours off. So one was rowing while the other was sleeping. Basically you would just wake up, get dressed, eat something, start rowing, finish rowing, change your clothes, eat something, sleep, and repeat.  I did have to run the water maker every day around noon to make our fresh water for drinking. We mostly ate freeze dried meals and a lot of Costco bulk snacks! 
Whales, fish, dolphins, no sharks (thankfully) I think I would have been too scared to swim if we had seen sharks.  
Do it! It will seriously change your life. If you want some inspiration watch Losing Sight of Shore...it's on netflix!  I was never scared for my life but I did get a little nervous a couple times.  
Thank you! I really appreciate it.   The race organizers had a "first meal" set up when we got back and it was a burger and fries! 
We had a very complex Garmin system called NMEA 2000. This included our GPS, AIS (which pings our location show we show up on other ships radar), wind/weather info, and navigation.  We used the GPS a lot in the beginning because there were several small islands close to the one we started on and we wanted to make sure we didn't get to close. After that..we pretty much rowed west/southwest and went with the wind.  If our electronics had failed we did have a handheld GPS that we could have used for navigation but it would have been very dangerous to be out there without an AIS. Since our boat was so small the big cargo ships could hardly see us. If we didn't show up on their radar there is a good chance we could have been hit.  
I don't feel like I was spacey but I do remember feeling overwhelmed by all of the noise.  
Oh, definitely! At one point my spotify playlists stopped working and I was left with two albums and some audio books. Lets just say I have those songs memorized. Sometimes I would count strokes..1000 would be about an hour. Definitely did a ton of daydreaming!  
Wow that is really embarrassing! I don't think I can change it either. Whoops. I guess I was nervous and typing fast.  It was weird being in a tiny boat but I think we got so used to it. Then when I watched some footage of our boat in the water it looked like a tiny toy! 
Thank you! I love my chacos. We definitely did not think about the foot setup enough before leaving. When I do another one I would mount those foot straps like wind surfers have and also get something comfortable for the heel. My feet were too small to fit comfortably that is why I had to wear the sandals! 
I trained for about 2 years leading up the race. I was rowing in college at the time so it was easy to stay in shape. For the southern Atlantic (East to West) the best time to start is in December. It is the time with the fewest hurricanes. East to West Atlantic is also probably one of the easiest routes. It has one of the most consistent currents and trade winds in the world.  No Disney release. Just a few YouTube videos for now! My arms are still pretty strong and it has been a year and a half! 
So this is kind of embarrassing but we both had really weird songs that we loved. I was a big fan of Celine Dion's "That's The Way It Is", "Jack Sparrow" by Lonely Island, and "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy Joel.  
I'm not sure! I know I definitely sang super loud but I don't know if George got it on camera. We both just belted songs out. It was one of the only ways to stay motivated. I also have "We Didn't Start the Fire" memorized now! :) 
I rowed for 3 years in college on a club team so I had some experience. We did the row as part of a race and a lot of the people on other teams had never rowed a boat before in their lives! There was definitely a wide range of people from hard core athletes to every day people and everyone ended up making it across! 
We kind of had our personal time during our rest hours when the other person was rowing. We never really got sick of each other because we didn't actually see each other that much! 
1. The race takes place in December-February because this is the time with the least hurricanes. 2. Our goal was to finish in under 60 days. We made it in 58. 3. We had emergency beacons, a satellite phone, and a lift raft if shit really hit the fan. Maritime law would be our friend..any boat that is able to respond to a distress call has to. 4. I lost 20 lbs. I had put on a lot of weight because people scared me and told me I would look like I was starved. I probably didn't need to put on as much as I did. 5. Definitely! My back was so strong.  6. We had a bucket for our toilet. We used biodegradable wipes for TP.  
We took 75 days worth of food. We had 3 freeze dried meals per day and lots of snacks! Our snacks included: trail mix, cheese its, goldfish, granola bars, candy (m&ms, snickers, hershey's), poptarts, mini muffins, and various other munchies. The snacks were mostly just calorie fillers and not meant to be very nutritious.  
Sorry I missed this comment earlier! It was definitely a little freaky swimming for the first time..but the water felt so good that I quickly got used to it! 
We both put on way to much weight before the race! People made us nervous that we would lose like 50+ pounds. Girls on average lose only about 10lbs..the guys lose quite a bit more!  No naughty time was had. We have always been just friends! 
Thank you! I've always loved the ocean and I saw a YouTube video of 4 guys from the UK that did it. Their video was so inspiring that I really got motivated to do my own row.   
Yes! We arrived in Nelson's Dockyard/English Harbor. It is the finish line for the race now so every year there will be a whole fleet going in! 
We tried to do 2 hrs on 2 hrs off but realized it was not enough sleeping time. We both felt pretty comfortable rowing for another hour and thought it was worth it to get that extra hour of sleep. I do think we lost a little bit of productivity in that third hour but since we weren't concerned about racing it worked out.  
Thanks! Yeah I had never heard of it either. People have been doing this since the late 1800's! Some people did it in an actually wooden rowboat..like with no cabin or cover. I don't understand that! Modern ocean rowing boats started in the 1990's. The race started in 1999 and has been going every year since.  
That's awesome! GAP is the best. Not much here. Getting pretty sleepy.  
There are basically two boat builders out there for these special boats. One is in the UK and their prices vary from ~20k-50k. We got our boat from a new company that just started a few years ago. They are in Port Townsend, WA and are called Spindrift Rowing. They are super cool and did an amazing job with our boat! Ours was actually the first American made boat to cross an ocean so that was really special!  
We had a pretty uneventful row in terms of equipment failure, weather, or injuries; which is definitely a good thing! I think one of the worst things that happened was we had downloaded a bunch of playlists of spotify so they would be available offline without wifi..and about 30 days in all of the sudden they were unavailable! Luckily I about 20 songs and my audio books left..but rowing 12 hours a day..20 songs is not a lot!  The next row I want to outfit the boat with better cameras! I feel like we missed filming a lot of cool stuff because we didn't take time to set the cameras up. I also would bring fruity candy! I surprisingly got sick of chocolate and probably would have killed for some starbursts or skittles.  
Hmm.. I'm a big fan of Remember the Titans, The Guardian, Lord of the Rings, actually..pretty much anything! I'm definitely not a movie snob. 
I flew home with my family from Antigua to Minnesota (it was freezing).  It was a very strange feeling. The finish was amazing! but we had spent almost the last 3 years of our lives planning this journey. Every spare moment was dedicated to it and then all of the sudden it was just over. The first few months back home were pretty tough for me. I really felt kind of empty and not sure what I wanted to do with my life! 
Bored: yes, lots of daydreaming was involved. Listened to music, rowed, listened to audio books, slept. We did a lot of wiping off with freshwater and baby wipes to get the salt off.  
1. Sponge baths with fresh water! Lots of baby wipes! 2. dryness like our skin? or the boat was always wet? I don't think we can fix the boat thing..it's just too humid! 3. Definitely! There were very un-athletic people in our race. 4. I do not think you would want to row for 8 hours. Your butt would be dead and you probably would be barely moving by the end.  
This is honestly my first time! One of my friends who is on here a lot told me that I should do an AMA because he thought people would be really interested.  
um... rowing. I mountain bike a little, I like fly fishing and hiking also.  
I think we got a good base tan being in the Canary Islands for two weeks before we left. We also had spf 100 that we applied every time before rowing.  
I would say a week or two? The first few days were pretty rough but it slowly got better. 
I would love to! I am not a great writer but I think it would be awesome to get all of the memories down while I still have them.  
We actually did it right after we graduated college. I graduated in May and worked a summer job..George graduated in August and then we left in December. 
We went by 5500 calories per day. We also had some hydration tablets that we put in our water. I think if I do more of these I would definitely meet with a nutritionist. I did notice that my pee was very neon green and my nails got very weak. I lost about 15-20 pounds on the trip! 
We watch a youtube video actually! Damn interwebs.. 
I cried twice. Once when my music broke and the other time I can't remember why. 
We did! We had about 5500 calories per day. Three freeze dried backpacking meals per day and lots of snacks! I would have killed someone for a pizza about half way through.  
No we weren't, we were about in the middle of the pack. We decided we were not as concerned about racing and just wanted to enjoy the experience! The first place team finished in 35 days and last place was 96! Everyone made it and we were actually the first fleet to have all boats finish! 
Thank you! Yes, we took turns sleeping. 3 hrs on 3 hrs off. Sometimes on my daytime off shifts I would stay up for a bit and chat. I also would run the water maker and get the meals ready for the day. At night it was pretty much switch over, eat something, and pass out. It was pretty amazing how fast my body adjusted to the schedule! 
No sharks but we did see a few whales, lots of flying fish, a lot of normal swimming fish, dolphins, and some barnacles on our boat. 
Not very often. My boss told me I need to get a shirt that says "Ask me about my ocean row" 
A couple fans would have been nice! Fruity candy, more seat pads.. 
Thank you so much! I enjoy letsrun. Rojo and Wejo have done a great service and made a wonderful resource for runners.   Oh, YEAH! I would love to see people like Jordan Hasay and Allie Ostrander get more attention, I'd love to meet them and watch their meets. I think it should be more of a spectator sport. I love watching running, I don't know why people don't like watching track and field...people just don't get it, I guess.  
MysticadelaSierra Hi.  I'm glad I inspired you.  Because it is you that just inspired me.    I thank you.    Stay true to yourself and everything will fall into place.  Don't let  other people make your decision on what and when to be happy.  Please don't let the unkindness of others stop you from being a good person at the gym.  I know, I know..Please continue towards your march of health.    The fitness is 80 percent in your kitchen. I found that out.  I have had a       
By the way...thank you so much! I'm so glad you're a runner...the running community can be so wonderful and supportive. :) 
I am Mi'kmaq, my tribe is in Maine and Nova Scotia! My kids are Mi'kaq and Chickasaw. I just recently was in Santa Fe speaking at the W.I.N.G.'s of America Coaches Conference, at the American Institute for Indian Arts. I love to go to reservations and talk to an encourage kids. I've been traveling since my daughters was 8 weeks old, she went to her first reservation in Bemidji, Minnesota, we went to Red Lake.   I'm so glad you have a group!! 100 milers...WOW! That's so awesome. It's so necessary for our communities to be active. I carry diabetes and heart disease in my family, it's such an issue...we need to be proactive.  
Hmmm...good question...I am a toe-striker when I run, so I had a lot of foot and lower leg problems. Achilles and plantar fasciitis were common with a lot of the people I ran with. I struggled with that, too. Shin splints...my hubby had a stress fracture in his navicular bone that he had for ten years. Those are pretty common as well.  
A lot...I married my husband Danny 25 years ago, we raised two kids. Before that I had my own store...owned a restaurant. I skiied. I was a massage therapist and a nutritionist...I worked as a nanny for a wonderful family. Lots of stories, lol! But the past few years were being a stay at home mom and proudly homeschooling two kids.  
I loved running so much, and how it made me feel, that by not going out after work for a drink with my coworkers, I didn't miss my run. I used to go out every night and drink Schlitz...I didn't let other people dictate my happiness. My run and the feeling I got during and after my run was the most important thing. I wouldn't let anything or anybody jeopardize that.  
Good question! I was just reading about Craig Engels this morning...love his hair. Hmm. I liked both runners, they both ran with heart, I have so much respect for both of them.   When Danny and I first got married, he had a ponytail, lol! I'd have to say long hair...I still wear it down when I run.  
Thank you. My daughter raven has a lot to do with the introduction.  She's my girl!  Yes, my running career.  I have a long term goal. but right now the short term is taking precedent.  Strengthening feet, ankles and lower legs.  I haven't thought about keeping track.  Hmm. Good idea.  
Thank you.  CIAO!!!! :)  For a young athlete..play.  Play, play, play.  Keep it simple.  Have fun.  Learn the basics and when you do you can apply them to any and all sports.  Soccer is super for body strengthening.  Exhaustion.  Know it well.  I'd say sleep, but being overtired one can not sleep.  When I was training I had to teach myself to shut down and I had to learn to sleep.  Crazy.    Now I meditate .  Yeah, I had to focus and I try to meditate everyday.  Five minutes a day.  It's nice.  MY daughter wants me to do Tai Chi.  So I think I'll take her up on that as It's better for me to have movement while letting go and be within...(sounds good huh).  Also I have found that certain foods help calm the body and sleep won't be too far off.  Chick peas, bananas, walnuts, almonds.  I personally will have raw local honey with chamomile tea with cheese and crackers.  I found the above helped me a great deal.  I suffered ...insomnia... 
I didn't, really. I ran with a group of guys. I've run with a group of guys. I just trained like a marathon runner, a long distance runner, not like a woman.   But...there are differences. Women are still behind in heart care. A paramedic would probably think I'm a corpse, I have a resting heart rate of 43. But ultimately it's individualized, its hard to speak for all women on this subject.  
Yeah, I've read articles about that too. I don't know. Personally I had kids late, and I'm thankful I had a healthy body and could have my kids in my 40s. These days (I'm 64), I want to get back to top-class, back to my top form, and I don't know where it's going to take me, but I'm reading everything I can and pulling out everything I know.  
I identify with you. It's hard to start and restart, it's just really hard. Stick to it, that's my advice. Be consistent. Set a goal for yourself, even if that goal is just running for fifteen minutes without stopping. It takes time, and you may get frustrated, but if you stick with it, you'll see progress.  
These days, more or less. I listen to Spotify. The whole neighborhood does because I hate headphones, lol.  
Hi. Thank you!  I was inspired to race the Boston Marathon by the group of guys I saw at the Quincy Y.  I started running March 28.  The Boston Marathon was in April. Listning to their "war" stories I wanted to do it too.  One of the guys said I had to qualify for the Marathon.  Hm, I thought I had to run a marathon to prove I could do a marathon..hmm.  OK...But the guy planted a seed by saying I didn't have to worry about qualifying time because the women had more time allowance.  A few months laater I entered the Ocean State Marathon in Newport, RI.  I ran my first marathon after a few months of running and losing 52 lbs.  I qualified for Boston by running a 2:53:40.  Under the men's standard.  (hehe)  Not planned at all.  I thought for sure I'd die of a heart attack during the race.   
Try changing your shoes. It sounds like you need to change them. Shin splints are usually caused by tight calves and toestriking...I'm a toestriker.   I would stretch before you run, especially your calves. Try dropping your heel on a step, 30 seconds, 10 reps each leg. Flexible shoes are key.  
I loooovvvee Toffifay. It's a hazelnut and caramel candy and it's delicious!  
That's so great! I used to go in front of the Y, all the way down Wallaston beach, to the Squatum Guard shack. Sometimes I'd go out and do the bridge, out and back. The police had their fire range out there, I think.   They didn't have my event in '80, so I didn't even have the Olympics on my radar...I knew my distance, and I knew I was a marathoner. And yes, I did try for the '84 team, I got 16th at the trials--to me, I just wanted to be on the line, I was tickled that I got to the trials themselves. I don't have any regrets. I wasn't raised with the Olympic attitude...everything I did in my career, I did to try and recapture that feeling I had in the locker room shower of the Y. 
I know huh?  Well, if I thinking about something, it'll pop in my head...and answer will soon follow or a justification will suffice.  Usually back in the day, I'd play out scenarios.  The "what if" game.  But it usually comes down to just relax and take note of what is going on.    Now, lets see.  I did a two hour run a couple weeks ago.  I picked a beautiful country tree lined road.  Rolling hills...very early in the morning.  I think I saw only 3 cars.  I ran in the middle of the road..sweet.  So yeah, I fantasize about achieving my goals...and WHAT IF THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED!!!  What would I DOOOOO! 
Good for you..a month.  Way to go.  Keep it going.  It takes time to build up to be fast and to be fast while going long.  TIME TIME TIME.  Be nice to yourself and take the time to build.  You will reap rewards. 
Thank you deusos!  Well, hmm fave fruit.  I eat lemons because it my favorite that my body needs.  My favorite to eat just to eat is...drumroll  KIWI!! 
The first time that I actually acknowledged that I wanted to do something in regards to distance and time was between my first marathon and my second marathon...they were a year apart. I did a 2:53 in my first marathon and I thought for sure I'd do 2:40 in my next marathon. (I did a 2:47 and I was bummed.) I had a whole year to train...I took the winter off though, because I didn't like running in the cold.   That was the first time I became aware of time and speed. Otherwise it was just run until I couldn't run anymore, and then get up and do it again.   Good luck on your powerbuilding!! :) 
I ran in the late seventies and early eighties.  I had heard of blood doping.  At the time I didn't know what it was.  And didn't know anybody who did or was doing it.  It was after when the stuff was made public that I understood it.  And no, didn't know anybody who was doing it.  Our "drug" of choice then was 120-150 mile weeks. As it probably is now.   
Oh wow, you have a goal...TERRIFIC!  More than half the battle.  ya'know it sounds like to me, that you need a transition period between getting home from work and going out for a run.  As to tips for speed.  I was strong.  Strength carries speed. I wasn't fast iin the shorter distances until I got stronger to hold a certain pace for a shorter period of time.  Over the course of a marathon strength is what  helped me through.  Push ups, sit ups core work...can't beat it.  When you are so tired, look towards what you ate during the day.  Too much caffeine, not enough water, too many carbs, brain tired, haven't kept the runs fun.    Change it up.  Change a course. Change the time you run.  Remember to keep drudgery to a minimum.  You have a wonderful goal.  Keep it wonderful.  Have fun enjoy the process.  It's real.  I look forward to you celebrating the end of June...with another running goal....yeah, I know, I know...that's how it works  Good Luck 
LOL! I never did. Other people did that for me. I always just accomplished things for me. I was very goal-oriented, and what other people said or thought about me didn't matter. My times were my times, and I stand by them, it didn't matter what gender I was or what ethnicity. They were good no matter what.  
No, personally. My recovery was an easy run. I didn't run on treadmills or in pools...if I couldn't run outside, I didn't run. Low impact exercise can be good for maintaining fitness through an injury, though.  
Goals.  Goals. Goals.   Little goals, stepping stone goals are important, I find.  At times the long term goals make for being overwhelmed.  And fear can set in .  Believe your goal.  Doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about it.  It's yours to make.  It's yours to own.  It's yours to work towards.  When the time comes, you may not reach the long term goal..but it won't matter because you did everything you could do to reach it.  It's the process...not the end result.   Ok, I know that may sound like a "get out of jail free" card...but it's the striving and making do with what you have.  You neva know what you have until you try. And that's where the work begins.    When you try there is NO FAILURE! 
I'd start by not running fast in the beginning of your run.  Think of how far you would like to go.  The pace you start with are you able to hold the pace for the length of time you would like to run.  One of the best ways to build endurance is to run consistently.  Take it little by little. Time will be your friend.  
I suppose I do. though I have not had it in eons..not any ice cream for that matter.  I lead a sad life. 
Really...no...really?  Huh?  Why?    Sad..."another one bites the dust.." 
Well, when I was under contract I went through quite a few (FREE).  Seriously though shoes at the time were good for perhaps a month.  Training and racing shoes.  Now I think it could be about the same.  For me, I go through a pair in about three months or so.  Right now...it's ok.   Yeah running will do it for you.  But if you can't run, don't give up...take the time you have for running and use it to walk...Many times a person gives up physical fitness because they gave up the time to something else...me included.  I have reclaimed the time.  If I can't run I don't... I walk.  Puppy boy needs to get out to run in the fields with his buds.  We have two other dogs. 
HI!!!!  Wow!  Ah, my mom was from Antigonish.  Beautiful.    Nice plaid, too.  I did have a skirt at one time but now I have a scarf. 
HI!!!!!  I attended Quincy College when it was a community college...for hmm, I think three semesters.  Notice I mentioned attended..lol  You're an Aries.  I do not know whether to congratulate you or send you a sympathy card ;) LOL!!  You are head strong. You poor dear.  Though it makes you determine.  People called me obstinate, stubborn  ..I called it "stickittofness".  And you will spit blood before you let go of a goal.  So make the goal...and go for it.  You'll have fun..because it's fun. 
The Mi'kmaq Tribe is a Federally recognized American Tribe.  Who knew right?  Well, they are and I found out when I went through the registering process. It wasn't easy.  Yes, she was from Nova Scotia.  The Mi'kmaqs have tribal land in Maine and I  have many relatives in Maine.   I am a registered voting Band member as are my children. 
Pretty awesome to answer the questions.  It's a broad spectrum  of questions.  Makes me think and helps put things in perspective.  My running was so long ago, but today it feels like it's happening right now.    The best questions...I don't know...I don't have a best.  I like it.. 
I share with Wilson. We have a good trade. He eats the skin/fuzz, I eat the fruit. :)  
She's half mikmiq (Canada First Nation Indian. Her mom ran away from Nova Scotia)  yeah, so she's not "100%" Indian.  When I read the headline, I assumed she was Native American.  She could of mentioned that in her bio. 
So funny story- there's this machine we kept in the back, right, called the Hate Engine. We have these siphons right underneath the desk that suck up all the complaints to add to the Hate Engine, and the Engine converts that hate into more money, which is why they keep adding service fees. More fees = more money = more hate = more more money.  Seriously though, nobody paid me to be a fan of Ticketmaster's practices. This whole ticket monopoly situation is kind of fucked right now. Best lesson I learned at the job was to always buy from the venue directly when I can. 
It doesn't really work that way anymore, unfortunately, at least according to my experience. A lot of it's the usual "get in early and get lucky".   With casino tickets specifically, though, there is the VIP angle to consider. Good casinos reward their players really well, and for us in particular we had presales a day before public sales just for our players. Also, depending on circumstances we'd sometimes get tickets back from our VIP folks for sale if they just weren't doing the numbers they expected, which would lead to some last minute openings- usually in the primo seats too, just because the VIPs get the good stuff to keep them coming back. 
Yeah, we used the old-school DOS-ass TMWin99. When I was training people I always said it's like using a program written in Swahili or something- you can learn a phrase or two and learn your way around to do some basic stuff, but beyond that it's really tough to figure out unless you've been doing it forever. It's a lot of rote memorization and repetition, which takes new guys a while to figure out. 
We still sold in house, we just used an in-house ticketing system that worked in tandem with the room reservation system before (I think it was called Showgate) and switched to all Ticketmaster in tandem with a major remodel about two years back. The difference in show quality was noticeable- we were getting good shows before, but we jumped from D-listers on average to B-listers. No Taylor Swift or Metallica or whatever, but still a lot bigger draws that pulled in a lot more sales. I'm willing to bet a lot of them got on board because their agents or record labels or whatever work exclusively through Ticketmaster. Like it or not, they opened doors. 
Here in Tampa at Amalie arena it is definitely worth it to go to the box office. You save on all the convenience and print at home and whatever else BS fees.   
Our venue did music and comedians mostly. Before we renovated a few years back we'd have amateur MMA live, which was interesting, but also tricky to handle since the theater wasn't designed for that sort of setup (since all the seats are on one side and whatnot).   The stage was actually enormous, which gives a lot of room for some of the real showmen that have come through (Alice Cooper, Empire of the Sun, and KISS come to mind) to work with cool set designs. 
In person it was free, $3 extra per over the phone. Recently they added a $2.50 fee on top of that to everything, no clue why. Still dirt cheap in person. 
I haven't, golf was never really my thing. Went to the arcade as a kid and tried a bunch of the restaurants during my time there, though. 
It varied a lot- show days were almost universally busy, whereas any day that wasn't within a few days of a show was slow as hell.   I had days where I didn't speak to another person all day long, and then I had show nights where I sold nonstop for hours straight and on-sales where we didn't stop selling until we closed. 
Could be.  What if Amazon, Google, or Apple decided to enter in the ticketing industry?  All could afford to just throw staggering amounts of money at the problem to make up for their lack of initial services.  They could bankrupt TM in short order.  Non-massive companies?  Nah, not really.  Consumers tend to see Ticketmaster from the perspective of a heartless entity trying to bleed them dry.  Ticketmaster clients (venues, promoters, etc) _love_ Ticketmaster because the available services available as a TM client are literally not available anywhere else.  TM has no real competitors for the upper end.  You need to get down to the "club" size where your Eventbrites and the like are very competitive, because the clients just need something super easy and quick. 
Turnover at the box office isn't as bad as something like the front desk, which was nonstop *and* dealt with complaints *and* was high-visibility. As far as management, I liked my direct superiors a lot, but more than a couple steps up the chain I didn't really hear from anyone. That could be a whole lot worse, but it wasn't great either. 
Allllll the time, dude. This is a throwaway so I don't wanna be specific, but a lot of gaming subs. 
It's still there, dude. Saw it a few days ago when we ate backstage for my little going away party. 
I can't speak for anyone but myself of course but man, I think she can go fuck herself. Heard from one of my bosses at the time that she was being an asshole to the people working at wardrobe and all that too.  I'm sure she's probably nice to some people but that was a pretty dickish thing to say. 
It varies wildly depending on the show, location, venue, all sorts of stuff like that. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that super popular acts sell out instantly.  From the angle of this specific venue, the casino and presales are what take the lion's share. Casino gets a couple hundred tickets at various price levels to offer their players based on their play rate (and I've seen players with an average daily wager rate from the single digits to the thousands), sometimes five or six hundred if it's a big show. Beyond that, our presales were pretty open so a lot of times the a good chunk of the front half would go before the on sale. At a guess, that means about thirty percent of a theater seating about 2500-2700. 
1) Interestingly enough it's likely that Ticketmaster splits a portion "their" fees with the venue, promoter, etc (however rarely the artist) as incentive to keep using Ticketmaster. That way everyone involved gets more money, TM gets the client/venue, and TM gladly takes the brand hit for having fees that are too high and not the other parties. They're so used to taking that brand hit, coupled with their market dominance that it's baked into their business model.  How do I know? Not telling. 
I have heard that, yeah, but it wasn't really true for our venue (max fee total outside of online was $5.50) so I don't really know how accurate it is, sorry. 
Swing/night shift for three years, then morning for the last year. Given that my new job is normal business hours, I'm glad I had time to adapt.  I was part time, but for awhile we were really understaffed, so I did more hours including a lot of overtime pretty frequently. 
Seventeen bucks and a free coupon for the local McDonalds.  Honestly I have no clue. We used Ticketmaster for our sales, we weren't actually Ticketmaster. 
Not at all, honestly. I'm not a very outdoorsy person. Tons of people come through the casinos for that stuff, though. 
Actually, I just told another couple stories on another comment higher up. 
A looser refund policy. Ours was "no refunds unless the show cancels" so there were many times where something happened and people couldn't go and we couldn't do anything about it, which sucks for everyone involved. 
It's been updated all over the place, man. If you're in the area it's good stuff. 
No clue man, ask TM customer support I guess. Might be a mailing list you can opt out of. 
Honestly I have no idea. You'd want to talk to an entertainment director or promoter, someone who works directly with third parties to negotiate the sales. 
Depends on the venue. If it's high demand, you've got more people going after stuff quickly, and you're more likely to get a shit ton of scalpers. That's kind of indicative of the sorry state of ticket sales at the moment, and there really isn't much we can do about it on our end either. 
Nope. Policy says "charge this fee in this circumstance". Can't really do anything about it- I didn't make the rules, I just followed them. 
My best guess is it's U2, they're hugely popular, so tons of scalpers got to it. 
I actually went to school for design, and left this job because I got one in my field. I enjoyed the ticketing side and interacting with customers (most of the time) but I never wanted this to be a career, just a way to help pay through college. 
They're not too bad on our end, actually. I know the bell guys hate them because they smell like shit, all their bags are covered in dust, and they stiff them on tips all the time, but for shows they're usually super chill.  We had Thievery Corporation come in for the burners one year in one of the pavilions, right? Our setup down there was two computers, two ticket printers, and two card readers, and it was just me and my boss at the time running it. We got down there and no printers worked, no card readers worked, and only one computer worked. My boss literally kept running back to the normal box office to print chunks of like 500 tickets to bring back while I was punching cards in manually and giving out tickets from a stack. Despite this, none of the burners cared about having to wait in line, they were super chill and let us do our jobs, which turned a nightmare into a manageable show. 
No, but I got a cool little keychain dongle. It says I Slept With Satan And All I Got Was This Cool Little Keychain Dongle. 
It depends on the size of the venue. We attracted some good talent, but none of the absolutely enormous acts that fill entire stadiums, so we never really had that problem. Kind of fortunate in that regard, really, since casino already gets a chunk of the good stuff, so with no scalpers buying stuff up fast there was still plenty for everyone else. 
Don't think so, I was using TMWin99 the whole time. I know the management system Ticketmaster One or something was online, but I was never a manager so I only saw it once or twice. 
If the venue charged what the scalpers charged and they still bought it up, what's stopping them from selling it at even more of a markup? 
$10 an hour, but it's okay because I got sexual gratification from being an unwilling cog in a machine far greater than any individual change I could make in order to pay my way through college.  Venue was a nice place to work, customers were good, liked all the people I worked with. Doesn't mean I like Ticketmaster. It's better than the available alternatives, but that's because they're all worse. 
Actually Disney totally left us alone, we did what we wanted. We got one note from Michael Eisner that said "love the show, could use more history" (EG) 
We actually haven't yet seen it. I (EG) just saw the documentary Bill Nye: Science Guy and loved it. I laughed, I cried.  
Never imagined the success of the original show. We talked about the show being relevant for 3-5 years, max. Almost 25 years later, to have so many millennials say they got into science from the series is so amazing to me.  And just a shout out to Mike Green, composer of the theme song.-(jm) 
Thanks - we were never approached though always happy to help out (eg) 
Good question. Bill leaned more to education, we leaned more to entertainment, a constant battle so to speak. We always felt if they are not having fun they will tune out.  Bill kept us on point with the message. We always tried to present different ways to learn, I (EG) got the most out of the sketch/humor parts, so I always leaned towards that.  Bill always had great real world analogies. There were times we felt a show might be a little flat and then it went thru audio post at Bad Animals and we were always cracking up in the final review. 
On camera, Bill played the Science Guy.  Off camera, Bill was Bill Nye, human- one that loves, laughs and is passionate about what he does.  To be on camera, you have to push that personality.     
Bill was very much influenced by Mr. Wizard. When it came to the production of the show we were very influenced by MTV sports and the PBS show Square One television. 
We were as surprised to hear about this as anyone.  We actually found out about it through Reddit comments.  We have no idea who did the edit. (jm) 
As far as I know, nothing flip-flopped, if anything he seems to have become more political. We totally support his stance on climate change. (eg) 
Oh man, that's so long ago, I don't remember. We had a great writing team, Mike Green and Tom McGurk did the music. I loved so many of the music videos in fact we had a whole episode with them. It was The Top 11 countdown - because 11 is a prime number (that's a Bill thing)  EG 
We all worked together at KING-TV in Seattle. There was no picking. It just was. (EG) 
Probably not. I also wished I was related to the Gottlieb Pinball machine empire. (eg) 
Absolutely. I majored in Film and Broadcast production and minored in Environmental Science - and when i grew up I wanted to do environmental documentaries....so years later i'm on the set of BNSG and a friend taps me on the shoulder and says - you know you are doing what you always wanted to do. I didn't even realize it at the time. (eg) 
That it continues! And my favorite educational show on right now...you mean other than Biz Kid$ of course, I'd say Arthur, still an all time favorite. Make sure to go visit the BizKid$ website and take a look at what we are up to nowadays! www.bizkids.com (EG) 
Hey there! To answer your question, he was born into it. (eg) 
You went on to be a scientist because of the show?  Thank you!  That was the plan.  We were working on the idea of a financial literacy show for years called Financial Genius.  We met our Canadian partner, Jeannine Glista, with her idea for a show on kid entrepreneurs called Biz Kid$. Now, we do about five stories on kids and their money per episode, all wrapped around one general theme.    So many kids think they can't do this, but when you see where some of these kids come from and the ways they are building their financial futures, it can be mind blowing.  Some have become multi-millionaires.  And I think if these kids can do it, anybody can. (JM)       
Like a proud momma!  That is one of my favorite quotes as well as is "keeping shaking science guy the sapphires fall to the bottom" (eg) 
I would absolutely love to see some statistics on the effects of the show.  We hear from someone almost daily about how the show impacted their lives and they made a decision to go into a field of science because of it.  That is very gratifying. (JM) 
It took weeks for a show to come together.  We shot the show in segments and would usually shoot segments for three to five episodes over the course of a single day.   If we were in the field, for example, we might be doing something on reptiles in the morning and rivers in the afternoon.  We generally shot on the main stage on weekends because it was when our science kids were free from school. We could usually do the lab scenes for two shows over a weekend. Offline usually took three weeks, online was a week, audio post went another week. (JM)      
The original Disney Presents Bill Nye the Science Guy series had very little negative comments from the scientific community.  At the time, we tried to do the best research our budget allowed.  We had a team of qualified young science researchers and a broad based science advisory board.  We did our best with the information available at the time.  Now, of course, there is this thing called the internet... (JM)     
The pilot episode of our series was funded by a Republican administration.  The series was funded by a Democratic administration.  This is one of those important discussions we should have over a beer. (JM)   This is not a one beer discussion. (EG)    
You realize these guys have nothing to do with "bill bye saves the world" right? 
They already said Bill, because Mr Wizard is already dead. A bit harsh, though scientifically accurate. 
That's not a bad idea. Get your foot in the door. Learn everything you can on the job. You can start working on your own show for cheap - shooting stuff on your phone. (eg) 
1. At KING-TV, we worked together. 2. The food. Jim went to one of the baths with one of our hosts and enjoyed it so much he went back the next morning and didn't realize (couldn't read the sign in Japanese) that they switched the male and female areas and next thing I hear are ladies' screams.... 3. Yes, it was an effort to not have the education overwhelmed by the humor/entertainment. We did have one rule of the road that the science was always the science and no faking/drama. 4. Probably my parents, even if I didn't want to admit it. (eg) 
Pat Cashman is the "What?" guy.  The character was created by Jim Wilson, audio designer, at Bad Animals studio.  They were always filling the show up with sound.  A lot of that sound was an attempt to make us laugh and we encouraged it.  One episode, at the final mix, a scene goes by where Bill says something a little complex.  There was a brief pause, we hear a deep-voiced "What?" and fall over laughing.  Almost immediately we start getting scripts featuring just the voice!  We quickly decided that only Jim Wilson could place Pat's voice.  (JM)  
I was an associate producer for the first three years of Almost Live!  I gravitated to John Keister's stuff and tried to help him every chance I could.  One sketch I remember was called Hydro Hijinks, about the hydroplane races we have every August here in Seattle.  In our version, it was actually local Norwegian fishermen trying to catch salmon faster with boats that exceeded 120mph.  Another sketch was Keister's Lifestyles of the Almost Rich and Famous, with Robin Leach.  In John's version, his fortune was made selling Amway.    We did a reunion show of sorts with a series we called the [206].  I just missed doing a show in front of a live audience.  It was a blast. (JM) 
Bigly. When we started the series we had one of the first Avid edit stations (non-linear editing) and one of the editors said he felt he was editing with mittens on. We don't shoot on tape anymore. For a while there we had to remember to brings drives to off load the media. You can probably shoot way more than you need cuz you aren't going to run out of tape. Today, getting your show on can be as simple as posting on youtube, I guess. (eg) 
We were very Influenced by MTV Sports. We also thought if we were getting bored of a segment - we'd switch the channel for you, so we threw in static and abruptly cut to the segment. We also had an awesome edit team. (eg) 
I wouldn't call it censoring as much as updating it to fit the way scientists think of gender nowadays. Also, it's been made clear in othet comment chains that Netflix didn't edit the show: when they got it it was already changed.  
oh now you're having me go way back into my past (eg) 
We touch a little on economics, but I think you may be right.  Possible new series idea? (JM) 
Bill, most definitely. And we built the show around him. (EG) 
Scientists aren't 'accredited'. Part of the whole thing is anyone, anywhere, can be a scientist by simply following the scientific method. There is no accreditation board where you earn a title and it's not regulated the way claiming to be an MD or JD is. Would you consider the mythbusters scientists, that's also primarily engineering. 
Sex and gender are different things, scientifically speaking. The quote is about gender. 
We are currently putting our efforts into Biz Kid$ and appreciate your comment. (though we never say never) eg 
I didn't intend to portray that.  And Bill, to my knowledge, has not claimed to have a PhD. (JM) 
Thanks for the question. I would say we were very strongly investing in MMOs in the late 90's/early 2000s and we stopped that side of the business because it wasn't performing well enough and we should have continued on with that. 
Hi! Splinter Cell is a brand we talk about a lot. It's also personally one of my favorite series. We don't have anything specific to share at the moment but teams are working on different things, so stay tuned for more.  
Hi there, that's a good question. I think yes and no, we have encountered some problems recently and we have some work to do on improving our services. It's a tough learning experience but I think we are progressing well. At the same time I'm very proud of the games we've released over the last few years and the success of live games like Rainbow Six Siege, The Division, For Honor, The Crew and Steep I also am incredibly proud of what we showed yesterday at our E3 conference. 
To expand on this question, what games from other companies have helped inspire you and drive you to create better games for the consumers?  
Hi there, it would probably be decisions about which projects to persue and which ones to cancel. Telling a team who've been focused on a project for several years that they won't be able to  continue it is very tough. However what I have seen is when we do cancel projects it is almost always for the best, it gives us an opportunity to learn to refine our ideas and come up with better games.  
I would love to hear an answer for this.  Siege is such a special game, it deserves more love from the finance department.  As a follow up question, have you been surprised at the growth and dedication of the Rainbow Six Siege community? 
I love it! It's the first time that we have seen that level of engagement and passion around a game we've created.  
To become a CEO I would say pick a fast growing industry you are interested in, surround yourself with the best and work hard! 
I would say Far Cry 3 on the Xbox One X would be amazing :)  
It's tough to choose by I would say Assassin's Creed because it gives me an opportunity to explore history. But I love all our games so it's very tough to pick. 
We have to go where we can find the best talent! We're always looking for very talented engineers, so I would be happy to open a studio anywhere we can find great people :)  
Hi there, first things first I read them! I very often dispatch and share them with our teams with my comments and I think they help us prioritise what we need to fix and get a good insight into the biggest concerns of our communities. 
Guy that was heading the story (I don't remember his name) left the company some time ago. Starting either with Brotherhood or Revelations it was basically axed and is not coming back. 
If you see me on the booth please come say hello!  
Thanks for the question! At Ubisoft what we try to do, when we can, is take ideas that people have and then try to make that 100% of their job. For instance Star Link which we announced yesterday came out of a Game Jam we had in Toronto and we were able to make that into a full project, For Honor was also a passion project that we were able to turn into a reality. And it has happened for many games we've published over the years! 
I think streaming will be the next big thing, but it will take time before it is ready. Streaming will totally change the way we create and play games, and will again positively disrupt how we think about gaming.  
As video game creators we have the fantastic power to anticipate and build games that allow us to experience what the world could look like in ten years-time. Playing these games is a way to test and learn and this I believe  will have a positive impact on the world. 
For us the world, systems and the gameplay mechanics are key to building a great game!  
I would love to hear an answer for this. I Loved The Division despite its bugs/exploits. The Dark zone PVP was possible the best I have ever played when everyone was legit. Wish the player base on PC didn't dwindle to almost 0 =( 
1. Swiss Dark Chocolate! I always have a stock on my desk for long meetings. 
Just wait, they said they weren't interested in Egypt a few years back, but here we are. 
I thought it would be big, but not this big. What is amazing with this industry is that technology is always giving us fantastic new opportunities to disrupt different genres and segments of games and to create new ones. I believe interactive entertainment is the future of entertainment, and we still have huge opportunities in front of us.  
Thanks very much, it's great to see such a positive response to our conference. My dog's name is Buddy!  
AMAs work of you ask one question. If you want to ask another question, post another question.   Flip the coin and now you're the one answering the questions. Do you want to answer ten different questions from ten different people, or ten questions all from one person? 
Recent Ubisoft games (Watch Dogs 2, Ghost Recon Wildlands, Steep and probably some others I forgot) were not downgraded at all compared to the gameplay footage shown before release. So I think you can expect Far Cry 5 to look like in the gameplay trailer. 
They'll probably roll out updates for both PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. It doesn't make sense for them to only do so for one platform. Same way as how the PC versions have been getting better graphics than both console versions, which will continue. 
IIRC It's called a "hostile" takeover as it's without the owners' approval, only the shareholders giving it a OK. 
Because they give us free dlc like rainbow six. They are the first one to push this model and they gotta make money somehow 
Nobody really knows for sure. He was found washed up on a beach and didn't remember anything before that. He might be the only creature in the world he inhabits not to have originally been dreamed into creation by Polokus. 
Thanks! Rest of the answer below on your second question. Duplicate.  
I was goingto do a gym in Manila once but I was always going to do one in Thailand for sure. Its the mecca and Phuket is the heart.  
Hey bud thanks! I got into fighting after watching The Karate Kid.   My gym in Thailand is called AKA Thailand. You can see more about it at AKAThailand.com. We are building it to become the largest gym in the world so its still a work in progress but moving fast.  Luke Rockhold and Javier Mendez have been out here training but not DC yet. He trains full time at AKA HQ in San Jose.  
Hey Reion, it was when I realized that I couldn't put 100% of myself into the fight camp and fight. I started setting myself up for a post fight career early and that just grew and grew so for the longevity of my life and future, business is just the best thing for me right now.   There is no issue with the language barrier at AKA Thailand or in Phuket. 90% of the people you interact with will have some understanding of english or speak it natively. Its a very diverse location due to tourism. 
Thanks Hussain! I have so many favorites now. My teammates at AKA of course.... Cain, Luke, DC, Thomson, Khabib, etc... As well as so many others! I like the fighters who go out and put it all on the line and go for it. Thanks for the kind words! 
Thank bud! I kneed a guy's tooth out after he was beating up a girl and threw a punch at me and then my friend threw him through a plate glass door. My friend was Christian Wellisch, who also had several UFC fights. He always got me into the shit, since I was the smallest bouncer. Oddly enough, I never get into street altercations, but my bouncing days were crazy. 
Hey bud, it can be many reasons. I can attest to the fact that you really do miss the fighting itself. The walking out, the fans, the mixing it up, and of course the winning. I think its just hard for fighters to realize when they are too old to do their best.   For me, I am happy and content in business now and operating AKA Thailand. I live vicariously through my fighters and enjoy their highs without any damage to my already damaged brain. ;) 
Thanks bud. Yes they measure us themselves. We go through very rigorous medical testing as well. UFC fighters are some of the healthiest athletes around.  
I can't speak for the other gyms but I custom built this gym from the ground up for 2 years making sure it was perfect in every way. We hold the exact same curriculum as our headquarters in San Jose and have had an amazing run of success in just 3 years. I don't think you will find a more clean, friendly and modern gym in this entire part of the world. Don't take my word for it, check out AKAThailand.com and scroll to the bottom to see what some of the biggest names in the sport have said about it. ;)  Email Info@AKAThailand.com, ask for Marc and mention Reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount.  
My fight with DaMarques Johnson at UFC on Fox 4 was my most memorable. I had 910 days out of competition and was still not well and it was a huge stage being on the main card on FOX. It was a war 1st round but I got the KO in round 2. ;)  I think most memorable was coaching Mark Hunt to his UFC victory over Bigfoot Silva.  
I see the "bare knuckle" Muay Thai events here in Thailand occasionally, but they actually do use rope over their hands. I don't follow actual bare knuckle boxing.  Best thing about living in Thailand for me is just having the gym in such a beautiful location and interacting with such awesome people that come in from all over the world.   Worst thing is that Thailand does not have a Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, In 'n Out, or some other of my favorite American eateries. 
Yes we do all types of training packages. Check out AKAThailand.com for more info.  
We actually get a lot of requests for this! I was actually in talks to do a gym in Manila before I finally built AKA Thailand. Never know...  
Yea he is a stormtrooper and much respect to him for breaking out and taking himself to a level none of us ever dreamed possible.  
I agree totally with putting kids in Martial Arts but not to defend themselves. I think its good for discipline and respect.  
Absolutely not. Most of the guests we get are not fighters at all and are just either looking for a good workout or to have a fun experience.  Email Info@AKAThailand.com, ask for Marc and mention Reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount. ;) 
Lmao no one who went to Clear Brook is better at anything from it 
Check out AKAThailand.com and then email Info@AKAThailand.com for all info on our packages and sponsorship info.  
Yes I own a big print shop in Northern California but I don't work there. I have a great team that runs operations for me. We are about to launch a new updated website soon (SpartanScreenPrinting.com) as well as another sister company, FighterPrints.com.  Yes I stay in touch with Jon Fitch. He has been a longtime friend of mine. We used to be roommates actually. He was up here with me at AKA Thailand a while back as well.  
I haven't heard much new from Kaensak but we now have Lamsongkram Chuwattana teaching full time with us at AKA Thailand.   Not to keep bringing up my site, but there is a huge archive of video blogs and series we have shot from AKA Thailand on MikeSwick.com. All new and very interesting.   Thanks for following!   
Honestly, I like Dan Hardy and feel no need to beat him up at this point. He is doing his thing and I respect that.   I am still contractually obligated to the UFC if I come out of retirement but it would take a lot to make that happen. I would have to get a fight with McGregor. ;) 
I fish occasionally around Phuket but my biggest catch was a Marlin in Cabo years ago.  
To work hard, never quit and accept your failures. There will be many, but you must pick yourself back up and push harder. I failed at building a gym in Thailand 3 times and lost well into the 6 figures of my life savings before I finally built AKA Thailand. It was so bad that my teammates at AKA HQ were really starting to feel bad for me failing at building a gym in Thailand and everyone was begging me to stop already and come home. I couldn't quit and took the UFC on FOX 4 fight to make the money needed to start AKA Thailand. Lastly, surround yourself with good people. Jim Rohn famously said "You're The Average Of The Five People You Spend The Most Time With". I think that is true and I had to learn the hard way. Be around the people that push you forward and are successful themselves.  
Of course you want to but if you really think about it, everything happens for a reason and the entire cumulation is what makes you what you are today.   As for LPT, surround yourself with success and never give up.

No not really. They talked a lot and many said they would beat me but most of the big talkers lost. I have a good relationship with all of my past opponents now and don't harbor any real hate towards any MMA fighters.  
Don't sweat the small stuff. I overthought too much and added pressure that I shouldn't have. 
Different guy. Mike from Mike's Gym is a Thai guy. This Mike is an American guy living in Thailand. 
To be honest, I haven't been able to keep up. I don't even watch TV that much anymore. Its just work and travel and watching the UFC or studying fight tapes.  
Thanks man I really appreciate you saying that!   The gym is at AKAThailand.com and yes I have tried to fight Matt Hughes ever since he said he was coming out of retirement and he never responded. That is literally the ONLY fight I would come out of retirement to take.  
Thanks! The shop prints T-shirts as well as does Embroidery and Vinyl banners and decals. Obviously fight shorts and banners too.   SpartanScreenprinting.com 
Thanks Brian! It was long hours but good money. I was doing it when the first PT Cruisers came out and they were money makers. 
There are a lot of Thai Fighters learning BJJ and wrestling now in Thailand so there will be eventually. 
Hello, I would like to know who your friend is. I may know him. As far as transitioning in, I think you just have to come and start networking. Its an easy place to come and fit in. Good luck! 
I still need to get a ticket and learn how to space travel first. Hope they have space for me. Its gonna be out of this world though! ;) 
You have to visualize things that you want in life. Actually see them. Print them. Feel them. Want them so much that you will climb out of the slump and chase them.

Thanks McGraner! It was not bad when I won the fights. The second fight in England didn't go so well.  
Train hard and embrace the mistakes and failures. They lead to success.  
Be a student and relax. There are many like you. Then train hard and embrace the mistakes and failures. They lead to success. 
I have a main accountant in America that figures it all out for me and then adds about 250% rate on top and bills me.  
Its a t-shirt and vinyl print shop. SpartanScreenPrinting.com (Soon Will Be Updated) 
I agree with the discipline and respect aspect. I do not think its a good idea for kids to fight at a young age even though it is very common here in Thailand. This is a special circumstance though as it is sometimes the only means for them to escape poverty and create a future for their self and their families.  
First, thanks for the support! In general many fighters in all gyms sustain injuries. Its just part of the game. AKA trains hard and therefore, the penalty is a high injury rate. The upside is a high Champion rate. Luke, DC, Cain, Thomson, Fitch and more... AKA has built more Champions and stars from the ground up than any other gym on this planet IMO. As far as AKA Thailand, shockingly we never miss a fight over injury and I think we train even harder than at AKA HQ.   
Its hard for me to say without all the facts. In general, I think if any fighters have to be drug free, then all fighters should be drug free. Its not like we are playing baseball or basketball. We are are fighting, and the use of performance enhancing drugs can cause serious consequences to the health of the clean and honest fighters. Its also a very bad message for the kids when they see these successful fighters on drugs. I never used anything and did ok for myself. I wasn't a Champion, but I did what I could and did it clean. I think kids need to understand that they also can be successful and even Champions in this sport without taking drugs. 
It totally depends on why you are going, what your wife thinks about it, how old your kids are etc... Its safe but a different lifestyle for sure. Many foreigners do live here with their families though. 
The wait backstage and the walk to the octagon is quite intense for sure. Its a mix of nerves and excitement, and then I transition to a bit of emotional anger right before. I make myself realize that the man standing in the octagon with me is there to take away my dreams and my future and my success. This is unacceptable, and then I fight with everything I have to not let him succeed in his effort. 
Bangkok and Phuket is very safe from Malaria so I never had anything more than just the Hepatitis vaccinations. 
I was never diagnosed with ADD but was diagnosed with Esophageal Spasm, which caused me to lose a lot of weight, drop to welterweight, and eventually start focusing more on a post fighting career. 
There is no real problem actually. Our guests can party and train as much as they want and our fighters are very disciplined and do not cross the line. In order to be a fighter on the team at AKA Thailand, you have to pass a rigorous probation period where everything is evaluated.  
Find a good MMA gym, be a humble student, and train hard! 
I think a warning and then a point deduction next if its clear that the fighter was not trying to avoid doing it. In other words, if a fighter is throwing his open hand out and pokes and eye and gets a warning, then continues to not close his fist and does it again, that should be a point taken away. 
Hello, I am not a fan of this and am glad USADA is coming in now. So long as everyone cannot take steroids, I think that no one should be able to. This is not baseball or basketball. This is a sport where an unfair advantage can have horrible effects on an opponents health.  
Hey bud, yes you can get the visa's required. My gym has a full administration team that helps all of our students and guests get visa's, whether its for a month or a year. Can check out AKAThailand.com or email Info@AKAThailand.com for more info.   My advice would vary depending on what reason you are moving here for, but its a great place that will be an adventure for sure.  
Thanks and I appreciate it!   More weight classes are just going to be a part of the progression of the sport. There are so many fighters now and so many fights. With the current issues of extreme weight cutting, new weight classes will just fix this.   Before, there were far less opponents and less weight classes is how the promotions could make the great fights people wanted to see. Now with so many more athletes, they can make great fights in many weight classes.   Long story short, yes I agree with more weight classes. I think fighters should be able to focus more of the fight and training and less about weight.  
In the very beginning it was a spectacle. Shock value entertainment. Then it became a legitimate sanctioned sports promotion with the ZUFFA acquisition. Now its as mainstream as any sport and growing faster than any other. The up side is how big it is getting and how much some of the fighters are now making. The downside is that there are so many fights that its hard to keep up. Its also hard to make a name for yourself as a fighter now. With over 500 fighters on contract, you really have to be special.  
I tell them that I am sorry, I thought I walked into a Starbucks for a latte.   Seriously though, I don't sleep. I try and take on as much as possible because as most people know, you fail a lot more than you succeed. Its a numbers game and I enjoy the challenge of chasing success. 
We need to stop selling weapons to the Saudis.             And start buying lasers from Lord Buckethead. 
I would really love for him to explain how he isn't a communist. Or better yet why he isn't. Because I can see how his views do not constitute communism, but his views are so close in underlying principle that I don't understand why doesn't just fully apply his convictions. Does he see a value to capitalism? Is that morally ok for him? 
His spending is covered and then some, also investing into institutions now will gain profit in the long run 
Yes, because a politician has never done an ama...  
Good.  Otherwise another generation will be disillusioned later after they have made a mistake, rather than before realising what they are voting for. 
If you're the the dominant party with a majority there is absolutely no reason to call a snap election unless you're extremely confident of being able to increase it in order to not only consolidate your power but postpone the next election which might take place at a time when things are far less favourable for you.   With that in mind, it's pretty incredible that Labour even held on to the seats they had, never mind gaining 30 in what was an attempt by the Conservative party to decimate the opposition while they were in the midst of in-fighting and performing atrociously in polls. 
Nobody wants to use trident you twit! We don't live in the cold war anymore, a nuclear attack isnt likely. Heck, even then it sill wasnt likely... 
The Labour party has record levels of support. Levels not even seen when Tony Blair was elected in 1997. I don't think he's done a terrible job.  Perhaps if Labour had backed him and hadn't been infighting they'd be in downing Street right now. I personally don't want Tory light. I put the blame on Blairites rather than Corbyn.     
Whether you refuse scientific research and established medical conditions or not... The "two genders", male and female constitute as multiple genders, do they not? 
We are doing some lane expansion on I-25 Loveland to FTC we helped secure federal funding for it. But yes, we need to do a LOT more. It also ties into the housing affordability question because people are being forced to live further from where they work- we can't let this hurt our quality of life it definitely has my attention and I will work with local governments and CDOT to preserve what makes CO special. 
At least Colorado is building, unlike other areas. Oppose NIMBYism at all costs. 
I will be a fair referee for all parties, not cozying up or showing partiality to a particular interest over others. 
I will be in Colorado Springs tomorrow as part of my announcement tour. I think that my message of an economy that works for everyone will resonate in every corner of this state. And Republicans have kids and many want them to go to pre-k and kindergarten too! 
I have voted and sponsored legislation on the side of privacy, reigning in the NSA and preventing warrantless wiretaps.  I've always supported a full audit of the fed.  Never met Mr. Snowden.  Focused on running for Governor to roll up my sleaves to make a difference, too much time in DC is spent debating rather than doing. 
yes the state will need to go to the ballot box to see if voter's want to fund our 21st century infrastructure needs.   We are growing and we need to catch up or or quality of life will suffer. Let me know your ideas! 
The veil of public office is easier to pierce than you might think. Depending on where you live, you might have the opportunity to run for city council, school board, state legislature, or other office.   So know your own interests and what you want to do. For me I care a lot about education and ran for and served on the State Board of Education. That is a part-time volunteer job, so I did it for a few days each month was still able to work full time. Congress on the other hand is full time. Our state leg is somewhere in between, they work full time in Denver for 5 months, then part-time the rest and many have other careers to earn income.  So know yourself and what you want to do, get involved with your community (HOA, non-profit boards, other groups), and find a realistic option (not taking on a popular incumbent unless you have a good reason) and go for it! 
I am actually touting Namaste Solar's co-op ownership model statewide, along with other employee ownership models like ESOPS and stock options. How is the co-op ownership working for you as an employee?  In answer to your question, yes of course I support finding a solution to TABOR. Specifically as Governor, I will build a winning coalition (business, educators, Republicans, Democrats) to bring to the ballot a plan to establish full day preschool and kindergarten and invest in our schools. 
I support single-payer health care nationally and if Colorado moves forward it should make sure it is VERY well written and will work. The last thing we want is a failed system that leaves people in the lurch.  I will be putting out more higher education plans over the course of the election about my specific plans to make college more affordable. I also tout dual-enrollment which allows students to get college credit and even an associates degree for free (or close to free) while they are in high school! 
I think we truly are reaching critical mass in tech. We have a vibrant startup community for sure. We have excellent startup infrastructure across our state. We need to be able to keep more success stories here and independently owned, but I think we will get there.  We also need to more fully incorporate our universities like CSU and CU into our tech ecosystem. There are some excellent programs like the Innosphere in Fort Collins, a partnership between CSU and Fort Collins, but we need more collaboration.  Any other ideas? 
well as a "voice of reason" in the house I am but one of 435 and my voice is all too frequently overwhelmed.   But as Governor I can set in place our goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040, universal preschool and kindergarten, and put in place state policies to create an economy that works for everyone by encouraging employee stock ownership 
They are all good and I wouldn't have any problem supporting any in the general. I know Ed Perlmutter and Cary Kennedy best. I've known and worked with Cary for close to 20 years (more so in the early 2000s than recently). I work closely with Ed in Congress. I don't know Michael Johnson or Noel Ginsburg as well personally, I've met them but never worked with them professionally or spent much time with them. I look forward to getting to know them all better over the course of the campaign!  They all seem to be good people and I look forward to hearing more about their ideas! 
health care in Clear Creek? Consider yourselves lucky compared to Summit and Eagle.  We need a Colorado that works for everyone. For our cities, for our suburbs, for our rural areas.   I support  21st century infrastructure including broadband, an education system including apprenticeships and skills, and encouraging employee participation in profits and ownership.  We succeed together as a state and all three parts of my plan are statewide. 
it's an interesting concept and I look forward to learning more about the results of the several pilot projects that are currently in place to try it out 
dude plains and mountain all the way, you get all the defense positions along with unlimited attack capabilities, not to mention a fuck load of trample  
marijuana food freedom (raw milk, hemp, non-USDA beef)  and many other areas relating to expanding personal freedoms  
I have one archived on a flash drive, I'm sad they took it down. I thought it was still up. Boy, Jason and I turned out differently didn't we. But for both of us, this is our last session of Congress. 
Protecting what makes CO special is a top priority for me.  In Congress, I served last session on the Natural Resources Committee where I fought to protect our public lands. Now we face an even greater threat of our public lands being sold off.  I am also working on additional wilderness designations for Summit and Eagle Counties to protect in perpetuity 60,000 additional acres. 
well our main arteries I-25 and I-70 are causing the biggest problems for the highest number of commuters. I would base my priorities on an objective scientific analysis of traffic flow and where the biggest needs are!   I learned a lot as a tech-entrepreneur that helps, mostly to be creative and disruptive and don't accept things the way they are just because they've always been that way 
How else are they going to fund the gluten-free roads? 
if they want to be, sure! and i think they want to be! 
Never banned :)  of course I support the entire LGBT+ community. We've come a long way but we still have a long way to go to achieve equality. 
Random note from an old job of mine - rep Polis has been a significant supporter of Boulder County CareConnect for years; one of their main programs provides transportation for seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
That's why doing these reddit things is great, we don't have time to get to all the questions at physical town halls (especially lately with the increased attendance).  I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but I for one try to make my decisions based on research and evidence and if I was governor I would appoint people to the various state agencies that did the same. I think picking people and setting the tone are two important things a governor can do. Are there any other specific recs you have?  
well one way or the other you will wind up with a different governor in January of 2019 (Hick is term limited). With your help, maybe it'll even be me! 
go for it! Don't let being a member of the LGBT community hold you back! 
'Member South Park? I 'member South Park.  I represent North Park County but sadly not South Park. But as Governor, I'll be the Governor of South Park! I LOVE the show, watched all the recent seasons.  1) Rural broadband 2) better transportation 3) Better access to job skills/training  
My plan is for Colorado to have 100% renewable energy by 2040. Congratulations to Germany on your climate leadership!  Yes many local governments and states in our country will continue to move forwards. 
As governor, I plan to help Colorado maintain a leadership role in the Cannabis industry. We have many opportunities to continue to leverage our "first-mover" advantage into a ecosystem that allows us to continue our industry leadership.  That being said, yes it's possible that sales will decline as CA and other states come fully online. Currently after paying for regulation of marijuana most of the taxes go to school buildings in lower income areas- we need it.  I will do my best to continue CO's leadership role nationally even in the face of additional competition. 
I think fracking should be greater distances from people's homes and more local control 
It's very important for rural communities to have broadband and high-speed fiber. I've been working on this federally and the state can and must step up too. I would like to see high-speed fiber as part of any infrastructure package. Infrastructure ain't just roads and bridges.  SIgn up at polisforcolorado.com so we know who you are and you can get involved :) Say hi when you see me around 
Great question! I am most comfortable on facebook and twitter. And of course I love reddit.  My main challenge with instagram and snapchat is I have trouble making my job visually appealing. Here I am meeting with so-and-so. Here I am meeting with so-and-so. Any ideas about how a candidate can visually engage in those mediums would be greatly appreciated! 
nope Gov can't do that.  I don't make pledges I can't keep ;) 
Happy to help. First of all I know very little about the market you are in (security for consumers). In fact when I first read it I thought you meant that you were selling securities (like stocks) to consumers! Like crowdfunding or something.  That being said, it sounds like you should reach out to the head of Security at major Universities locally (or nationally if your product is national). Get a sense of their needs and let them know what you can do to help them. Within their budget, they usually have quite a bit of autonomy,  You don't need a network so much, even if someone with a big network was doing it they would still need to cold call the heads of security at Universities. Good luck! 
Great question! I have really enjoyed bring by best efforts to modernize Congress. I've hosted hackathons, worked to open Congressional information, and I also still have a year and a half left there so I'm not done yet!  But my reason for being in public service is to make a difference, and I feel I can make a bigger difference by rolling up my sleeves at the state level and helping CO lead the way in renewable energy, an economy that works for everyone, and education. And I can work on modernizing state government with new tech and ideas, and even though it's a smaller pond I'll be able to do more than as 1 of 435 members of Congress! 
what kind of food to you like? price range? food style? 
OMG I AM SO EXCITED!  AND AS GOVERNOR I WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO MORE GAMES THAN AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS! 
I'd love some info and citations on the private military presence in CO if you can post some.  And yes, the threat of biological AND nuclear threats from non-state actors is going up as technology develops. I won't have to worry about that AS much as Governor as a member of Congress, but I will still try to see if there is anything the state can do to keep us safe.    
Wow! That's the first fish I've ever had named after me (that I know if). I hope little Jared lives a long and healthy life.  Your life will be better if CO reaches 100% renewable energy by 2040, our air will be cleaner and we will be healthier and it will create green jobs that can never be outsources  and encouraging more firms to share stock and profits with employees will hopefully affect you to  and if you have kids you will LOVE free preschool and kindergarten, and I say that as a dad of a 5 year old and an almost 3 year old. 
In this area, Governor Hickenlooper has done a good job. We need to make sure that our immigrants feel welcomed and know their rights under the law.  We are a welcoming state, and the Governor needs to set the tone. I wish there was more the Governor could do to fix our broken immigration system but sadly that is up to Congress and I'm not holding my breath for the current Congress to fix it and unite families. 
i plan on serving out my term to fight "this administrations insane policies" and will work to ensure that our Democratic nominee wins and holds this seat 
because many school districts divert funds to early childhood, these funds would be available for other functions if we fund pre-k and K universally! So that's good!  And of course I support more funding for our schools and to make college more affordable but only the voters of the state can provide that, not the Governor :\ 
Dual and concurrent enrollment allow high school students to get college credit, even an Associates degree, for free or close to free while still in high school!  And more state funding for higher ed tied to reductions in tuition would also help. 
Couldn't you blame lobbyists for a large part of that? 
I don't think that there is anyone who thinks that I do the bidding of the oil and gas industry 
I'll give you a curly answer:  If I had absolute power over the legal system I would get rid of the provisions that gave me absolute power. No one should have absolute power, not even a well-intentioned fellow like :)  
I've spent some time with him and like him a lot. You also wouldn't want to mess with him he used to (maybe still?) do one of those pit-fighting things or something like that (more than just boxing, more street fighting or something).  Course whatever we're doing now under Buddy Black is working well!  
Neither one! I support expanding our refugee program AND improving the vetting process   
The question needs to be more specific. I have voted against continuing funding for troops in Afghanistan as an example.  
I'm a parent of a 5 and a almost 3 year old and that is honestly not on my list of concerns. If a parent thinks that the legal treatment of marijuana is causing the disconnect, I suggest they dig a little deeper there is probably an underlying reason for the disconnect not related to the legal treatment of marijuana 
Thanks so much. One tumor was in the middle of the brain but shifted to the right. It wasn't operated on but it's gone! Tumor #2 is on the right side of the brain, about 1-2 inches above the temple but deeper in the brain. Tumor #3 is on the left side and like tumor #2 but on the left. 
I knew I had two tumors in my brain two years before I had surgery, but the doctors hadn't been worried until 2012 when they started to grow. Most of my symptoms were migraines, loss of feeling in my left side of my body, seizures, and mental fogginess. 
The best thing to do is just keep her happy however you can. I see happiness as a medicine. It works for me and I believe it can work for her as well. Be empathetic, but don't treat her any differently. Make her smile and smile with her. 
This battle has been a pure blessing in my life. It's shaped me into the man I am and I'm very grateful for this battle.  Funny thing, in 2012 I was sentenced 2 days before surgery to live then after surgery I was sentenced 2 years. I'm still alive today! What a blessing. I still don't really have a bucket list mentality. Nothing wrong with it, I just sometimes go with the flow. 
Thank you very very much. I'm a musician, so writing music and recording it is my favorite. 
I feel that the body houses the spirit temporarily. I still feel close with my body because I'm living. Even though that I have a lot of faith in God, so I am closer with spirit. 
I did receive remission once but another tumor showed. So we have yet to see where to go. One of my montras is,"Never give up" The fight may be hard, but who said the crown goes to the winner? 
Remission was declared in January of this year, but another tumor was found later on. My doctors have found a new treatment for me to start, but I am postponing the start date by one month to see if the MRI results improve. 
In a way yes but I'm more grateful towards the little things now. 
I did have to stop school but I know that everything is for a reason. Because I know that, I'm never really worried. All this time I've been undertaking this battle has been great and I'm grateful. 
It's writing music and it never changed before and after the journey began. 
Thank you! This is how I've always been. If you get bad news you just have to keep it all moving. I just like to add a smile because it's fun being happy to me! 
Due to the tumor locations and movement, I lost a lot of mobility in my left side. This makes it hard to; walk, eat, brush teeth, get ready for the day, live life, play instruments, etc. etc. So, I'll usually have one to assist me through life. 
The most memorable thing is from the surgery team, when I asked the doctor to take a picture of my tumor. Instead, they filmed the surgery! 
God honestly helps me stay positive. Through this entire journey it was Him that kept me going. In 2012 the moment I learned I was diagnosed with brain cancer, the first thing I did was thank God because I knew this would be for a reason. 
That's awesome! So, don't hate me because I'm a not a full time vegan but I am full time vegetarian.  My favorite meal is actually yellow rice with pineapple, white onions, cilantro, Hawaiian seasoning sauce, topped with avocados that have chili powder sprinkled on top :) 
Just the nausea chemo causes.  A lot of them (I think all) were in total shock. They were also in shock how positive I reacted to the news. 
I do take supplements , while I also follow a routine of simple physical activity that I can handle. I don't have much alternates... 
Wow, what a powerful story about you and your father. I'm glad y'all sound good though. Through my journey, I was inspired to establish a foundation in 2014. Here's the website. Please check it out! www.farwf.org  Thank you so much and I'm happy to send positive vibes your way as well :) 
Well, a lot of people have different characteristics like; tolerance to treatments, age, immune system strength, and most of all POSITIVITY! The tumors did cause me to be physically disabled in the left side but I'm not mentally disabled. 
I usually am pretty careful who I tell that I am gay. For me to be doing this AMA is quite a big step but I'm hoping to make more contacts/friends.  The one incident I had was I was walking with a sighted friend and holding his arm so he could guide me. I had my guide dog with me but I was holding his leash and not his harness. All of a sudden, some kids started yelling "fag, fag, fag" and began throwing bottles at us. My friend said "hey, my friend is blind!" As soon as they heard that, they stopped and apologized and one of them said, "I'm sorry - I thought you were a fag." That was the worst incident that ever happened to me. That was about 10-12 years ago. 
No, I must be honest and tell you I've never had a partner or been in a long-term relationship.  My friend who is doing the AMA is involved in this project and I think it is something that's really needed. In my present situation, I have helpers who would come and help me for a few hours a day, so I have not availed myself of it at this time. If you have more questions about it though, contact my friend u/runbrownmanrun 
I want them to remember me as a person who does his best to help others to understand what it is like to be blind and gay. Also, I hope they will consider me a kind person. I also hope that the fact that I have never seen will make people understand that being gay is not dependent on sight and is not a choice. I know this because I didn't even know the difference between boys and girls when I was growing up. I know that sounds strange, but it is the absolute truth. 
(Answering in order)  I do not have any racial factors - race is not important to me. I judge people by somewhat intrinsic qualities - kindness, gentleness, people who are not afraid to hug, who are not afraid to touch in a kind way. Those are the things that are important to me.  I have no strong opinion on that except that I have no respect for someone who immediately dislikes someone because of their race  I guess many people have preferences - some like heavy people, some like thin people. For me, I tend to like people who are on the heavy side but that is not always necessary. I tend to like people who are a little hairy, but again that's in no way written in stone. 
(Answering in order)  I realized I was gay when I found that when I hugged a guy or an older male, I had a strong attraction to that person. Whereas when I hugged a woman, I did not feel anything at all. I love women as friends, but hugging them is kind of like hugging an inanimate object for me.  His voice, his smell (a nice cologne) and when I give him a hug. For me, I have to have some kind of a physical contact like a hug before I know if I am attracted to the person. Some people attract me more than others and because I can't see, it must be something to do with pheromones that I can't describe. I have met guys who are wonderful but I don't have an attraction to them and I don't know why.  I love Italian food like lasagna, which is probably why I am such a big guy.  
I am interested in meeting gay people in general, not just gay people who are blind. I am not really the kind of person who is good at starting groups. There have been some groups for disabled gay people but I don't think there are any right now that would be good for me. 
Wow, I've heard the Finns are very lovely people but I've never met one till now!  I think one of the things that keeps me going is I hope that, if I put myself out there, like I'm doing with the help of u/runbrownmanrun, people will respond and I will make some interesting and meaningful contacts.  
I have a computer with speech and, as I type on the keyboard, it speaks what I have written. I was friendly with the person who edited Bent Voices (the website where the essay was posted) and he posted it for me.  I can't but I am. How can you prove your sexuality? 
this is a request only, not actually lord buckethead himself 
It's the kind of thing he'd probably do once he'd had enough sleep.  
JB: Any and all of the Flower Scouts. I love the Flower Scouts.  AL: Mine's Preston. He's the best.  BM: Mine's Quartermaster (JC: You have a thing for old men.) 
GH: Depends. These days the tendency is to bounce ideas around the animation creative staff. The more people we have chipping in ideas the stronger it gets.  MT: Collaboration! High five!  JC: One of the biggest advantages Camp Camp had was its longer (for us) development cycle. We were able to really flesh out the setting and how the camp worked, and what a typical episode would be.  GH: Plus Matt and Burnie are always pushing us to make the best content we can.  
AL: It comes down to the director and animator, and usually we get to do our own key poses after getting direction from Jordan. We add our own little touches to it as long as it fits the character/scene. He's very open to collaboration.  JB: We can often hear laughter coming from the writer's room so we trust that it's gonna be good. 
JC: In the episode that just came out today, we have a 360-degree rotating shot of a two-dimensional character that I knew was probably going to kill Yssa, our lead animator. Before we even did storyboards for it I asked her to make sure she could do it, and rose to the occasion and absolutely crushed it. 
JC: Storyboarding the shots for the scene in the finale between Max and David was a lot of fun to direct. Coming up with more dramatic angles to adjust the tone for the scene was cool. Going from David on edge and Max in control, then switching, then having them be on equal footing without ever really moving from their spots was an interesting challenge.  BM: Mine was Spooky Island!! I had to animate the scene just before the reveal at the end.  I loved playing with all the emotions happening in that scene from terrified Neil and Jasper to angry Max. 
JB: It's not really a project, but a part of Camp Camp... that GOD DAMN flag in the intro crashed so many times when I was animating it.  AL: The cloud Campbell from Episode 12 was traditionally animated and had to be done during the last day of production. Maggie is the worst. Just kidding. (Not really) (Justkidding..dakjfoia) 
JC: My favorite to write for is Nurf; we always say lines in his voice in order to make sure it feels like something he'd say. Also his voice is just really fun to imitate.  BM: Old Man in Rocking Chair #1 from episode 8. There's just something about him.  MT: Larry the Hamster! I miss him so.  
MT: ~*~Boring answer time~*~ This is always one of the most difficult questions to answer. We don't typically work on episodes linearly, so if we're just looking at actual days it would probably be about 6 weeks. But if you broke out every step of the pipeline and completed them one at a time, we'd be looking at about 14 weeks per episode. *pants*  (I can provide spreadsheets later.)  JC: Spreadsheets are lame. 
MT: We were really surprised at how many fans applied to join the team. (Andrew is the biggest RT fan I've ever met. [BM: Actually Tanya is.]) If we see someone who is talented when going through resume submissions we hire them?  Also I'm really proud of saying "post-abortion rape" on On the Spot   JC: I can't top that.   
JC: I actually never went to a camp, but a lot of the inspiration I use for writing episodes is just from summer vacations when I was a kid. I take a lot of inspiration from Ed, Edd, n Eddy especially. Miles was an eagle scout so I guess he knows all the camp shit.  AL: I went to a summer camp but there weren't like any Nazis or anything!  MT: I went to Engineering Camp! *pushes up glasses* 
GH: With Max you're always trying to strike a balance between savvy-kid and some kind of childlike ignorance.   JC: Keeping Campbell's weird type of humor in check so that not every joke is about a Cayman Islands bank account or some geopolitical statement can be challenging as well. 
JC: It used to be a mix of Flash and After Effects for season 1 of X-Ray and Vav. Then we discovered the glory of Toon Boom and never looked back. Even RTAA is made in Toon Boom now. 
JC: Homestar Runner is the only reason I became an animator.  JB: The pencil test for the Avatar: The Last Airbender finale fight. I changed my major after seeing that.  BM: There wasn't really any one time I got inspired, but I was always genuinely interested in animated films when I was younger. And I always would watch the behind the scenes stuff. Then I discovered Glen Keane's interviews and his animation process and I knew then that's what I wanted to do.  AL: I saw Tom & Jerry as a kid and didn't understand how it was made. Then I realized you could have a job making things like that, and it sounded a lot cooler than an office job!  
MT: That's the only way this show gets made. The 2D team is surprisingly small but mighty so many people wear multiple hats.  BM: The character designers will sometimes talk to us about how we rig and animate the characters so they can implement that into their designs. (Animators have also been rigging and modeling the characters thus far.  We wear many hats!)   
JB: I like the reprise of the Camp Camp theme at the end of season 1  MT and AL: Quartermaster's wobbly dildo hand.  GH: Every time we make Miles scream as David.  BM: I like the part where Max fixes the Order of the Sparrow staff. It's cute. :3  JC: When David and Max stare each other down in the finale, and the lightning strikes in the background. 
JC: We've done a couple of things animation-wise nobody has picked up on. In the Spooky Island episode, we didn't give Jasper a shadow. And in Sex Swing episode 1, the dialogue on the TV in the last scene is actually dialogue from a scene in the finale episode.  Also our storyboard artist, Al, puts a crap-ton of stuff in the backgrounds of a lot of shots. 
JB: More than you'd think, but less than they deserve.  GH: One mmmmilllionnn dollars. 
AL: Danny Devito  MT: David Cross  GH: Donald Glover  JB: Justin Roiland  JC: Matt Chapman or Alex Hirsch 
MT: We've been working with a lot of people on projects throughout the company this year, including animating the trailer for the new game we're publishing Battlesloths (check it out if you haven't already!) But don't be surprised if you see more 2D animation popping around here and there.  GH: Facilities and accounting seem cool - let's do something with them. 
JB: Last season's finale was pretty crazy, with the rain. Turns our animating rain is hard.  BM: I had to animate Neil rotating on the operating table in episode 7, and slowly turn his head. It required a lot of traditional animation with lots of hand drawn stuff.   GH: Non-typical movements tend to be the most challenging things to animate.  AL: THAT FUCKING CLOUDY CAMPBELL IN  EPISODE 12 
JC: The reason Nurf wasn't around early on in season 1 was because we had no idea what his character would be. We finally had a breakthrough with the "bully with a conscience" angle and he's been stealing scenes ever since. 
MT: We are who we are, we don't change for no one!  JB: I don't think we were very reserved at all last season  AL: What JB said - if anything we can get away with more now  GH: I don't know what you all are talking about - get ready for the most WHOLESOME CAMP CAMP YOU CAN IMAGINE - breathe a sigh of relief, no more cursing  BM: We're all so much better at using the tools that I think we're all more confident in our abilities 
JB: Band Camp Kid  JC: Anime Kid  MT: Rasta Kid  GH: Pasta Kid  AL: I'm already a camper so the best one already exists.  (If you didn't notice already, there is a camper from when Davey went to Camp Campbell that looks just like Andrew - because it is Andrew. Where the fuck is my camper?! - mt) 
JB: How the two counselors from when Davey went to camp look like Gwen's parents.  JC: Canonically they ARE NOT Gwen's parents. But y'know if you want to have that as your head cannon, I'm not going to stop you.  MT: Terrace House -  we are addicted (Mizuki is best girl)  GH: Maggie's addiction to reality shows  AL: Maggie's addiction to Steve Buscemi  GH: Our addiction to Maggie's addictions 
MT: Reptar!  AL: The Dirty Bubble  JC: Max  JB: Rogue bears, I dunno.  BM: Manbearpig  GH: Kerry 
JC: We try to limit ourselves to one musical number per season (they're really difficult to make x_x)  MT: One thing to look forward to musically is new songs from Richie Branson in the end credits for every episode! SO STICK AROUND CHUMPS! 
MT: I feel like it's made the department grow a lot closer. But it does make maintaining the inter-departmental relationships more difficult. Plus I hate having to go to the other building all the time for meetings.  AL: We still have our own mini-fridge, so that's a plus. 
All: We appreciate your point of view and definitely try to take these thoughts into consideration whenever we approach any piece of content. We'd rather acknowledge the darker parts of the world than ignore them and let them fester. We don't think that any jokes are presented in a way that condones any type of hate. We're not trying to normalize the outrageous but sometimes we'll use the outrageous to demonstrate how ridiculous a character's thinking or motivations are. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to address concerns such as these. 
Great minds think alike! We just answered the first part of this question from another user (pittgrad09).   This project is the same in the sense that we must complete all of the WHO requirements needed to declare elimination of transmission in Nigeria just as we completed them in these other places. It's different because Nigeria is so much larger (most affected country in the world).  We think that five of the 37 states have done this already in Nigeria and many others are close. The population spared of river blindness in those five states alone dwarfs everything that I mentioned above in the Americas, Uganda, and Sudan. (F. Richards)  
 $100 million will be used to super-size the program and enhance the flexibility to respond to the local epidemiology of the disease. For example, those areas we think are ready to stop mass treatment with Ivermectin will need a full WHO type evaluation that requires molecular laboratory support. That will be costly. In those areas where transmission is ongoing, we will need to add additional interventions like twice per year treatment with Ivermectin. That will be expensive too. Lastly, there are many areas in Nigeria that we have to reassess to determine if they are ready to stop or if they need twice per year treatment. That will be costly. The point is that we urgently need to do all of these things as soon as possible.   It can't be business as usual!!! (The Carter Center, Frank Richards) 
1) Nigeria is the country most affected by river blindness in the world. 40% of the global population at risk is in Nigeria.   2) No, not for this proposal opportunity.  3) 12.5% because there are eight semi-finalists.   (Frank Richards) 
It would be impossibly expensive and well over $100 million to pay distributors to treat over 50 million people. Just think, this is two dollars per person to treat over a period of up to five years. That's less than 50 cents per person per year.   So, we have to rely on volunteerism and it has worked up until now. Remember, Nigeria already has the largest Ivermectin distribution program in the world based on volunteer delivery.  In a way, we should also look at this as community empowerment and how people themselves can change their OWN lives. (Frank Richards)  
Good question. The big issue is in areas where transmission is ongoing. We absolutely have to treat twice per year there, with good treatment coverage as soon as possible if we are to stop mass treatment throughout Nigeria by the year 2022. (Frank Richards). 
It is important to recognize that The Carter Center is making this application on behalf of the Nigerian partnership dedicated to eliminating river blindness from the country. That includes the Ministry of Health, a number of other NGOs, and the communities afflicted by river blindness. We will implement the program through providing sub-grants to our partners who have been working in different states in the country to fight river blindness for many years. We all believe we can do this!!!! (Frank Richards) 
Great question!  Probably, and if not, $100 million is still very close to what we need.   A big issue is what the value of the Nigerian currency (Naira) is against the U.S. dollar. In other words, $100 million can be worth a lot more or a lot less depending on global exchange rates.  And recently the Naira has been falling against the U.S. dollar. If it is not enough, The Carter Center has always had strong partnerships and generous donors. The infusion of these funds will surely draw other donors to the cause! (Frank Richards). 
We admire all of the semifinalists and believe all proposals are worthy to be funded. If only there were enough money to do massive good!  That said, our proposal will eliminate a disease once and for all that will benefit generation after generation of Nigerians and serve as a beacon for other countries to follow suit. We believe in a world free of river blindness. (F. Richards) 
The Carter Center has worked in the Americas as a partner to eliminate river blindness from four countries using Ivermectin: Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and last and most recently, Guatemala.  We've also had great success in Africa in Sudan and Uganda. Although those countries have not completed elimination within their borders like those countries mentioned above. (Frank Richards) 
Insecurity like Boko Haram, and/or kidnapping and other insecurity is a big risk for everyone involved in this - Nigerians and foreigners. This keeps me up at night. But the people working on this are heroes! They are willing to take the risks and be on the front lines to treat the most neglected people in the hopes in solving at least one of their many problems.   (F. Richards). 
Thank you so much! We are a big fan of our fans!   I've been in love with parasitic diseases since I was a medical student at Cornell. You can read my profile on cartercenter.org. The Atlanta Journal Constitution did a whole story on me to answer all of your questions and this is on our website also. (F. Richards) 
The Nigeria Onchocerciasis Elimination Committee (NOEC) has developed standard operating procedures for assessing these areas. In a nutshell, we go to villages located close to rivers where there are rapids and test children for antibodies that show they have been exposed or infected to river blindness. The test is a blood test (finger stick) for OV16 antibodies.  If greater than one percent of kids are infected, the area is considered to be at risk.  (F. Richards) 
Thanks MagnumPeeEye! Great name. A control program is one that goes on forever, whereas a true elimination program is one that comes to a safe ending. Elimination programs are much more difficult than control programs because they have to reach everyone, they have strict guidelines (high burden of proof), and an accelerated window to success. That means they are more costly, but in the long run they are infinitely more cost-effective. One more thing - not every disease can be eliminated. There is no dishonor in a good control program, but at The Carter Center we believe that when a disease CAN be eliminated, we should go for it! Because the rich and the poor all benefit equally form an elimination program, we believe there is an ethical imperative. This fits completely with President Carter's belief system of equity.  (F. Richards).

I am sorry but good with hardware in the sense, It can run in any machine (PC, linux based system), speaker (inbuilt, bluetooth, headset), same with mic and so on.  The initially goal was exactly that but due to lack of certain packages I resisted doing that, but yes in the future I could really see that happening, the thing is Python code doesn't work with mobiles yes you can use some kind of compiler but all of these modules weren't available, so I need to write all of the standard development kits and then integrate with python compiler to Java for android.  So one other choice could be to build the entire Stephanie on Java itself which I might do it if I clear up some time in my busy schedule, but you're more than welcome to read and copy any kind of logic from Stephanie to create your application!  
No ofcourse not, *cough* Stephanie is an open-source assasgoodin platform built specifically for voice-controlled applications as well as to automate daily tasks and hence imitating much of an virtual/personal assistant's job. It is written in python and I call it more as a framework than an application. 
Thank you! You need to have a solid understanding of fundamentals and few design patterns after that you can easily look up the documentation of various packages and integrate them as needed.  But yes more often that not you need to create your own package because of it's unavailability, and the architecture of the application is really important if you wanna create something stable and efficient!   That's why design patterns are amazing to get hold off, after that you need some imagination and some creativity? Sounder Algorithm for instance, I had to research about NLP in order to come up with an idea, some solid principles of mathematics doesn't hurt either! 
Probably finish reading all of the books which aren't completed, next step would probably be two mini personal projects and another stock market manipulation.  I am honestly looking for a job, I live in a small town in India, so I'll be trying to move out to big city and learn some new experience from it, but as of now, I am constantly reading books and completing courses, i dunno I just love learning as compared to working.  You didn't? Check the developer API! I have demonstrated some demos to write as well!  As I said before, I believe systematic education hampers my speed, I am one of those individuals who can keep learning/working for 16hours straight and then go a week without doing anything real good. And alongside I believe in 21st century, with all of the resources present in front of you, there is no real need of a college unless you lack in social skills. 
Just three things:  1. A working machine: windows, linux or whatever. 2. Speaker: Inbuilt, headphones, bluetooth, headset? 3. Mic: inbuilt, bluetooth, headset, headphone, freaking phone connected to machine? 4. Internet Connection.  And you're done, download the files, install it and it's ready to work, check more in the installation guide where there's step by step procedure written!  
I dunno honestly, I always loved the open source community, and wanted to contribute to it! Plus I am kind of fun dude, like I invent stuffs for fun, because I wanna use them, its only after that I realize, hmm, maybe others can use it too? But other than that I just wanted a free virtual assistant without any kind of ad blot.   I am 18 years old currently, 5 months to get 19! 
Honestly, I don't have a programming job yet, I have answered it above in more detail.  I'd say, learn more about design patterns and actually create/collaborate with other programmers to make some personal projects which then you can share it with the community to get some feedback and take it from there! 
I am a high school graduate, I graduated last year, Honestly Google.  I'd say start with some basic course, that isn't too long, once you complete that you start to get an inner belief it can kickstart things, atleast thats what happened to me. 
Sure why not? It'll be really good! I believe for scripting Python is among the best programming language to work with!  I started with Java honestly, not exactly But I knew data structures, oop principles and what not, but it was python which helped me immensely to become better with it's design patters, and coding regulations.  You know what if you really like the 'feel' of an interface, give codecademy.org a shot, it's a really good platform to learn programming interactively! 
Yes, that is pretty much unavoidable! People always ask the wrong questions.  
That Steven Spielberg accidentally stole the title of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" from Dr. Hynek 
That Dr. Hynek was a badass astronomer who pioneered the field of celestial imaging. The Hubble space telescope is Hynek's progeny! 
I believe we were switched in the hospital. Thank you for noticing! 
The Tremonton, Utah movie film from the late 1950s is pretty convincing evidence that something real was seen.  Catcher's mask, hands down 
That many UFOs seem to be both physical and non-physical at the same time 
Definitely along the lines of another dimension or another vibration, if you prefer... Something that our science may never be able to xplain! 
I have become less enamoured of the "extraterrestrial hypothesis" because there is so little evidence to back it up 
Start with "The Edge of Reality" by Hynek and Jacques Vallee, then follow up with Carl Jung's UFO book. 
The question assumes that any of the Tracy's would be helpful, which is open to debate. But if they were useful, John Tracy would be the most useful, as he manned Thunderbird 5, the space station in earth orbit.  
This will sound weird, but the Japanese film "Goke, Bodysnatcher from Hell" is the best alien movie ever! 
The only UFOs I've seen I'm pretty sure were lame Chinese lanterns :( I Know plenty of people who have really strange, scary UFO experiences, and I kind of envy them 
Great question! He did battle with a number of interesting foes, and I had to focus on only one: Carl Sagan. I wish I could have included more of those villains and how Hynek dealt with them. 
Really, my experiences only expand my opinions of what is possible, and so I think of death as an interesting adventure 
Well, that's a trick question you see... I'm not sure if "scientific" work applies to UFO research anymore! 
Didn't we already send Matt Damon? Seriously check out the work of Robert Zubrin. He's got it all figured out! 
Stop going to UFO conferences and events that feature the same tired old UFO "experts" talking about the same tired old topics. Avoid anyone who claims to have a "smoking gun."    
That is an excellent question! A number of respectable UFOlogists have put considerable time into studying this very thing, and while there are unquestionably geographical trends that appear from time to time, they never seem to amount to anything. There's a great story about the government apparently having such data and using it to predict a sensational UFO event in the 1950s, but I have found no way to prove or disprove the story. 
I love Men In Black stories! Not the Will & Tommy Lee kind of MIB, but  the creepy, terrifying, strangely inhuman kind that harass and threaten UFO witnesses. The best account of those I've seen is John Keel's awesome book The Mothman Prophecies.  I can't speak for Dr. Hynek, but the most hair-raising thing I've come across as a UFO investigator was a local family with a history of paranormal experiences and a very real, inexplicable link to one of the famous "saucer crash" myths that was very likely an Army psyops scam. That one still gives me goosebumps! 
My brother Matt & best sister-in-law Casey got for that for me for my birthday a while back. It is a "Zanti Misfit" from The Outer Limits, and it's scary as hell! 
Yes, I worked as an investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) from 2011 to just recently. I've investigated about 150 sightings, and of those about 25 were just too weird and perplexing to be explained. At least by me.   
That's an interesting thought. I could almost see it, but that would mean that our future selves are jerks for messing with us like this, wouldn't it? 
My favorite genre is science fiction, but my favorite film is not sci-fi at all: it's a 1982 British comedy called "Local Hero." 
Some of them likely are, but beware of making blanket analyses... That's what gets most UFOlogists into trouble. 
I have no idea who "Sheriff Mason McKinley" is. Can you elaborate? 
The biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization is that there is not enough research to use it on patients.   The biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization is that it has therapeutic benefits far greater than research would suggest.  
It's a mix between cancer, autism, seizures, PTSD. This is only for pediatric patients, however. There is no way to approve adults for marijuana yet but access should be available by Spring of next year, which is fast, imo.  
I believe that people do get slightly stupider when they are high. I don't think it's very significant though and most of it centers around the short-term memory loss.  In the long run, I think it may be beneficial for intelligence. It certainly won't increase it, but I think there is a protective effect on brain cells and the mind and I certainly don't believe any decrease in intelligence occurs from long-term use. Cigarettes and alcohol on the other hand...  
Cannabis in general will be useful because of its anti-inflammatory properties and improved tolerance to chronic pain.  
Talk to your own doctor first, if you feel comfortable with that. Then, if they are not applying to be a registered cannabis physician in PA, call our office (855-420DOCS, or 844-4PA-WEED) sometime in the fall when we're closer to the medication being available and we will touch base with you then about the most recent regulations and policies concerning attaining a medical marijuana card.  
It'll be a long time until it's legalized on a federal level. The current administration is not accepting of it's medicinal status as is.  
The hardest challenge has been fighting the criticism and false allegations encountered by individuals, groups and entire organizations.   Here's the catch: Those people who have hurt me the most and caused me the most distress have been pro-marijuana activists. No person or group that is against marijuana has caused me even close to the amount of damages as those with personal interests in the marijuana industry.  
I'm not OP, but am a Neurologist/Pain Specialist, with a subspecialty in Epilepsy, am also an MMJ Prescriber in NY. Can see some of my posts in regards to proof, and all that good stuff.   To answer your question, yes Medical Marijuana could help you combat this panic if you were utilizing CBD-oils in appropriate dosages.  
Some of the most interesting ones to me include the Crohn's disease study from journal of gastroenterology I believe from a few years ago. The more recent larger epidemiological study(s) from earlier this year that verify what I see in my own patients at the clinic. The Harvard studies with tumor suppression on breast cancer tumors in vitro. The CBD study in NEJM from this past month by Devinsky, et al. showing CBD benefits on seizures in kids with the Dravet syndrome. The large California-based epidemiological studies from 5-10 years ago that demonstrated safety and limited long-term side-effects. These are some of the good ones out of the limited research we have.   What's far more interesting to me though is seeing the results on my own with my own eyes. It is eye-opening, to say the least.  
I'm not so sure it would be very beneficial to you without the feeling of being high. From my experience treating patients with similar symptoms, it's the psychoactive constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that has the most therapeutic effect. Therefore, I think you should reconsider the possibility that getting high may actually be beneficial to your psyche. Take this all with a grain of salt cause without a proper doctors visit with me such recommendations are generalized and may not be true to you or another reader since it is so individualized, this treatment. 
DE is a microcosm of what shouldn't happen. Essentially, it has become a medically legalized state with one company holding a monopoly, completely unable to keep up with the demand, resulting in a large blackmarket for patients holding medical marijuana cards. The goverment-run medical marijuana program is really great though.   PA is a completely different ballpark. It has banned flower and the smoking of cannabis. I believe this regulation will be a blessing in disguise if it does persist after the state fully adopts the medical marijuana industry. One thing is for sure: The state is rolling out its program smoothly and quickly relative to other states.  
There isn't much data to suggest smoking cannabis is unhealthy. Certainly not like cigarettes. Still, there are a lot of carcinogens and tar inhaled in the smoke. So even though there isn't much data to suggest it's bad for you, we can extrapolate that by removing those harmful byproducts of combustion, we are getting the same benefits without the additional contaminants, thus creating a greater net positive for one's health than smoking marijuana.   
I don't think that this is going to be helpful. I've never read anything on this and can't even think of a mechanism by which that could happen. That's my initial impression.  
Recreational is one thing.  It's not the worst thing you can do in terms of recreational drug use but altering mood and cognition may not be the best either.  If your brain is under 24 years of age I would lean in the "not good idea" direction more, knowing what we do about brain development.   Replacing or forsaking actual treatments is another. Please don't do that.  /Not op, but a psychiatrist. 
I definitely believe that marijuana should remain medical. I also believe it should not require a doctor to get and should be available to anyone in need of it. I call that "Over the Counter Medical Marijuana."   There have been no significant problems with recreational legalization in many individual states now so I think we can say that the same would hold true if the remaining states legalized. The pros and cons are really the same regardless of who I am "being." Personally, I usually remain in the same (mind)frame regardless of circumstances so that question doesn't apply to me much.  
I guess medical marijuana prohibition tends to be associated with more conservative viewpoints.  
It's basically a pseudo-recreational situation. If they would just eliminate the need for a doctor but keep it medical patients could continue to receive the same benefits without needing a shill physician's assessment. "Over the counter medical marijuana." It's the best of both worlds.   
I find that psychologists and mental therapists are much more open to the use of medical cannabis to treat mental illness than psychiatrists are! I've had a very positive response from psychologists and behavioral counselors throughout PA and DE who have asked me to come speak to them and teach them about cannabis therapy. Psychiatrists on the other hand... well, I had to import my own into DE from PA because not a single psychiatrist in Delaware would help a patient get a medical marijuana card. In a sense, there still doesn't exist a psychiatrist from Delaware that approves patients for medical marijuana. The reasons for that are very complicated and probably too subjective for me to discuss like this on the record. :) 
I have not had any patients tell me that their visual 'floaters' improved after starting medical cannabis. Can't say any have had that be a primary problem either.   Tinnitis, on the other hand, has on multiple occasions walked through my door. Patients with cranial trauma-induced ringing in the ears have contacted me specifically because cannabis use eliminated their tinnitis (each case was a unilateral problem, fyi) immediately and completely. While this is only a few patients personal accounts, the similarity of their experiences suggests to me there may be a real therapeutic benefit that they are experiencing. Time will tell! 
I think that there are too many politics involved in the politics of federal marijuana legislature, if you know what I'm saying. I don't think I have enough influence to create change on that level. I have, however, changed state laws abour marijuana. Last year I helped approve terminal illness as a condition in Delaware by contributing to the petition that was submitted and writing a letter of support. I have been in talks with the PA MMJ program too and expect to be in close communication with them in the future, the same way I am in Delaware with the DE MMJ program, though right now they are completely too consumed by the task of instituting the state's new marijuana policies and birthing a whole industry from scratch. 
Getting high is separate and not necessary for the herbs therapeutic benefits.  
No, it isn't a permanent solution. Medical Marijuana is similar to that of many medications, you would need to maintain proper dosing in order to adequately address any symptom.  
Yes, THC has been shown to cause anxiety and paranoia in users.  
It's part of the process, as a prescriber myself I've had patients come seeking MMJ but having no documented diagnosis and/or ailments. It's not awkward, it's just being honest.  
As generalised as it may sound, yeh, I think theres some credence in doing something like that - i know efforts are ongoing to tap into that superstition element and make out that rhino horn curses you or something like that. ALthough I like the specifics of your idea!!!!  I do agree its something that should be addressed with some vigour. 
Hardest was simply managing different identities, and constantly pretensing to be someone else. It was a bit draining!  Never found out, but close to it on occasion - if baddies were even a mite suspicious, they would often address you as 'officer' or something, just to see how you would react, and you are alwats somewhat paranoid so you begin to think 'Oh no, do they know?'  
No questions are stupid! The difference is chalk and cheese. INTERPOL are not cops. Its simply an organisation which tries to facilitate cooperation between countries. INTERPOL staff have no powers, no investgative capabilities and no jurisdiction (unless they are seconded police officers working WITHIN theor own jurisdictions). It's a rather lumbering bureaucratic organisation, which does the best job it can given its limited remit.  Compared to being an undercover cop, it was much less exciting, but much more interesting if that makes sense? 
Maybe, but then are we not encouraging the concept that ivory as decoration or status symbol is acceptable, and perpetuating this ideal? 
A bit of both, but majority of work is targeting those involved at the middle/upper end of the chain certainly from an investgation perspective 
SOmetimes the most innocuous situations were scariest - just being in the company of very bad people, not knowing what their intentions were or anything like that. Got stuck in a dead end road once, with a guy with a gun, and couldnt see my backup. SPhincter was clenching somewhat. There were a few scary moments, but honestly, nothing which would make your hair stand on end! Thats the reality Im afraid!! 
In some prvate game reserves, ostensibly, yes  - I don't work in that sphere, but some reserves would consider 'conservation' to mean heavily armed paramilitary guards with shoot to kill policies. There are certainly reserves (especially in southern Africa) where trophy hunting fees will fund actual conservation, but I retain a healthy level of sceptisiscm about that sort of thing. 
Theresa May. Not my fave person anyway. Its pretty damning really - we need to be at the forefront of emilinating the trade, which includes delaing with 'laundered' ivory which surfaces in Europe. It's not (as some in the chattering classes may think) about ivory per se, it's ultimately about the destruction of a rather magnificent species of animal, and I think its incumbent upon governments to do their bit, and attack the issue from all angles. 
- Yes - My wishes would be better choice of tattoos, a permenant supply of strong Ethiopian coffee, and an end to children needlessly dying globally - I'd be happy, but somewhat slighted, possibly slightly violated/used 
I can help your friend if you give me his name and his current location. And his phone number.  On a serious note, no-one is ever 'wanted by INTERPOL'   INTERPOL sometimes publishes Red Notices to alert other national police agencies that someone is wanted by another country, so, if its true, your friend will be wanted by the state where he is alleged to have committed an offence, not by INTERPOL. INTERPOL have no powers of arrest or anything.  The situation in Venzuela is very grave, and hopefully some semblance of order will reign soon. 
Really????? INTERPOL is an international organisation comprising almost every country in the world, regardless of our membersjip of the EU. The question should be 'Do we get any benefit from INTERPOL?'!!! It is a much misunderstood organisation! 
Yes often. In which case I am adept at using the inside of the toilet roll (the cardboard bit) to remove most of the detritus. After that, well, it gets a bit difficult. 
I like to think of myself as a living Pez Dispenser version of Beeker from the Muppets 
Each day is pretty unique, depending on the days news, if I'm out filming or down in an edit putting a piece together. It's a very communal office, so if you're not on the show you can hop into joke meetings or help out some other aspect of the show. Normally if I'm not on I'm probably prepping for an upcoming field shoot or perusing the internet for some nugget of news to jump into. Either way, there is still a part of me thinking about what I will be watching on Netflix later in the night- but ultimately I'll spend an hour scrolling through Netflix, unable to make a decision and thus leaving me frustrated by my indecisiveness. Then it's the morning and I do it again.  
I grew up in Michigan where guns were much more normalized. It's always been an interesting issue in America as they mean very different things to people depending on how and where you grew up. Also, Ive done a few pieces on TDS about guns and found the conversations on both sides of the topic to be fascinating. Surprisingly  there seemed to be a good amount of common ground that wasn't being talked about and I wanted to go back to Michigan and hear some of the moderate voices than don't tend to get air play. 
1. We were filming with Pat McNamara at a North Carolina gun range on the back of his flat bed truck. It started rolling down the hill and while the crew stood dumbstruck, Pat Mac took off, full sprint and grabbed the truck, put it in park and also saved equipment that was near destruction. He is a super hero  2. GIANT step forward 
The Good Guy with a Gun Piece was a favorite. Going through the process of training to be a "good guy" was eye opening. Those dudes who run the response training were really impressive. Outside of guns I enjoyed sitting down and talking with Pastor Mark Burns, and had me a blast doing the "Future Christ" segment. I picked three. I'm sorry, perhaps that's my vanity breaking through. 
Because then he would be forced to show reasonable gun advocates instead of crazy people like militias. 
Thanks! I gotta say Alaska. Denali national park. Not only is it gorgeous and unique, but the people of Alaska have their own pace and way of looking at the world that was refreshing.  
It's not the ONLY way, but it is one of the most effective ones. 
This is a great question. I can't claim to have the answer but I do think it's important to study the links guns have to violence. It's too easy to automatically equate guns with violence, but at the same time, it's too easily dismissive to separate the gun as a tool from the violence that may result from it. Either way, all of us can agree that we should be exploring how to lower violence in general. At its most basic level, I think funding to study the link is a good first step to see  what the next productive step could be. 
Without knowing anything about it, just want to point out that a "balanced" special (on any topic) would examine arguments from both sides and challenge people on both sides. So in this case, challenging a gun owner in one part of the special doesn't mean the whole thing is anti-gun. 
Yes there is hope. There is specific C -PTSD treatments like Trauma focused CBT.  I don't know your full situation. Depression is like being in a dark hole where you are in the hole and people above you are trying to throw you a rope to get out and what you need is someone to get in there with you and show you the way out.   I highly suggest going on psychologytoday.com and searching out a therapist in your area. Also look into Autism services or social groups.  Depression is deeply hard. Trying looking on the inside and see where maybe you are hindering yourself from social interactions in your thinking.  There is ALWAYS hope. ALWAYS. 
Yes.Therapists should work on a principle of "do no harm". If I don't think I am adequately trained in something I will not see that client but will always offer a referral to someone who does. Specifically I don't really treat Border Line personality disorder, schizophrenia (anymore) and Autism. I am not specifically trained in a lot of these.   
Worst is pretty relative I suppose can you be more specific? Worst trauma, worst mental Health symptoms?  As far as study tips go... Sometimes Caffeine works as a stimulant for ADHD, so Coffee works for some of my teens and kids. Secondly studying in increments of your attention. If you find you can only pay attention for 5-10 min, study for that, take . break for 10 min and go back. Don't beat yourself up if it's not a long time just study incrementally.  
Make sure you utilize the social supports around you, study groups, the college counseling facility ( Free Counseling!). Make sure you balance social and study time and don't isolate yourself even if you feel like doing it, but do take alone time! 
Really finding a CBT therapist would be awesome. CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It is based on what we think deeply effects our feelings and emotions and looks to correct negative thinking patterns in ourselves.  Look up some CBT stuff as well if you don't have the money for a therapist and do the work sheets. CBT is scientifically proven effective.   I worked with a kid who had significant problems even more so than yours to the point of suicidality. He put the work in and it drastically changed his life.When I met him he had tried to commit suicide the day before and by 6 months he graduated on his way to NYU and stated to me that he was glad he had not died. 
So they have Social Workers who have a lot of the same training as therapists and can help navigate some of that.  Its not a bad idea however. They also have Child Life Specialists in hospitals that are trained to help kids deal with illness and surgeries.  
Washington state is amazing. I actually reside in Portland but am Licensed in WA state...it's weird I know. Different states have different licensing guidelines.  
I know it's a huge cultural phenomenon right now and it is being addressed in mental health  agencies right now, but i haven't seen it. I definitely should though. My only thought is that I wish Netflix would put the suicide hotline up before every episode.  
Repeated answer sorry: I know it's a huge cultural phenomenon right now and it is being addressed in mental health  agencies right now, but i haven't seen it. I definitely should though. My only thought is that I wish Netflix would put the suicide hotline up before every episode. None of my clients have brought it up yet.  
So most of my time has been spent with Children, Teenagers and Adults up to 25 but really my most challenging adult was one who slipped into delusions every so often in session, where he thought we had met before and that people were talking about him and all sorts of things.   
Therapy animals are a tool, not a cure I believe so I think success is relative.   To be honest I couldn't give you a number but I do believe The "emotional support animals" phenomenon is widely abused and not highly vetted,=. The fact that you can go online and order vests without a proper therapist or doctors note tells you something right there. Puppies aren't emotional support animals, they usually cause more stress and anything.  However there is a definite distinction between therapy animals and emotional support animals. A therapy animal has specific training to  help a disability.  
All the time. I currently work in Community mental health as well where we have Psych's  on staff. I have worked pretty closely with ARNP's as well and they have written me a recommendation letter or two when I was applying for other jobs during my career.   Also I have LOTS of respect for you guys in that field.  So thank you for the work you do! 
Hmm I can definitely see where this might occur because trauma is often times blocked out of the brain or repressed and sometimes, sexualized behavior or other behaviors have direct links to sexual trauma and can't be explained by other things, so a therapist bee lines for that right or wrong...and it's wrong you should never try to press a client to remember things they can't. You might ask a question or two about a certain event but lots of time your own intuition is leading you. This is why supervision and consultation with other therapists is soo important. Lots of therapists are isolated, without any support or a space to bounce ideas off of.   I'll be honest, there are ALOT of crappy therapists out there whose intuition is off, or they have poor boundaries or they lack lots of empathy. 
I would have a really hard time understanding why a kid would mistake me for sexual services.....and no I have never had anyone come onto me although this is one of THE biggest reasons counselors get sued.  
Licenses re-issuances are due yearly on your birth date.  So All my paperwork was done and put in in Marchish and didn't clear until May and birth date is in August.  
To be honest no. I am always trying to improve how I work with clients however. Sometimes you lie in bed at night and think, I should have said this or that or the other, or I shouldn't have said this, but I am never afraid to admit to a client next week, that I may have said the wrong thing and clarify with them or re-hash what happened previous sessions.    I have never had a client or former client commit suicide yet but in this line of business it is bound to happen, it's almost inevitable. I'm sure then I will heavily evaluate things I said or how I could have helped them further. It's just a fact of this work.  
It's everything you dream it would be. Also I've known her for a long time and everyone always knew she was going to be a star. 
Well I'm glad you liked it enough to see it 3 times! I'm a little hesitant to answer this one because of the ***SPOILER*** aspect of it, but as you know, things aren't what they seem and our stripper character has a very redemptive story line.  
No, sorry. The movie doesn't really have a lot in common with VBT except for the accidental death (spoiler: our girls don't kill each other). But I think you'll love it!! 
1. Literally what took you so long??  2. Rough Night is actually rooted in similarly grounded characters who happen to find themselves in an unfortunate situation -- but if you like the show you're gonna love ROUGH NIGHT -- promise. 
It was amazing -- Scarlett's such an incredible actress with insane range, and she was so funny and charming and improvised a bunch too. Some of my favorite lines she improvised. I would make a million movies with her if the President of Hollywood will let me. 
Bo plays Tobey, one of Peter's best friends (Peter is Scarlett's finacee, played by Paul W. Downs). He helps inspire Peter with one of the most epic monologues I believe has ever been committed to film. He's incredible. 
We wrote the characters based on real people/friendships and then re-wrote a bit for the actors once we cast. It helped a ton that they all bonded super quickly and all genuinely love each other. 
I thought I'd have a lot more time to shoot than I did. Shooting five women means a lot of coverage and we had to move very fast. Thankfully my DP Sean Porter had designed an incredible lighting rig that we basically just turned on every day that enabled us to save a bunch of time which saved my life. My hero! 
I started directing before i was in a writers room -- my advice is this: direct a lot. Direct videos, put them online, and then keep making more. if you check out our old videos on paulilu.com, you can see the old ones are pretty rough (hey-ooo!) but got better as I kept directing. If your stuff is good, you will get work. Work with people you think are talented, and keep grinding.  
I genuinely have no idea what I'm going to do or what city I'm going to be in. Where are you going to be? I'd see it with you if we're in the same town. 
Yes Kate plays Pippa, an Australian that Scarlett's character was friends with from her semester abroad. Pippa is loosely based on our real friend Pippa (sousstyle.com!) who is Australian, and it was always scripted that way. Also, if you're looking for good Aussie comedy check out "Summer Heights High" and "Please Like Me" (I realize that is unrelated to the question.) 
1. yes 2. world peace, for my family and friends to be healthy for a very long time, and for mother nature to take back what is rightfully hers. 3. i do not shame the sexuality of lamps, and would be happy to have been part of it's pleasure. 
I keep changing my mind on what my favorite scene is. Right now it's when Peter does his sobriety test. 
Pretty sure this'll be reposted even after Guardians of the Galaxy 3. 
It says, "We gotta make him a real Redditor!" for anyone wondering.  
If that was me making this, it wouldn't have been done until MCU is finished and the writing wouldn't move around... Probably just subtitled... In slide format... And blocky as shit... Like an 8 bit game... 
I'm still a bit confused, is Baby Groot the same Groot but a new spawn? Or did the OG Groot die and this is sapling is sort of his son?  
For this much karma, I'd make a new account about PP!  
Why are people so hesitant and afraid to give OP credit in their reposts anyway? Do they think that will reduce their karma somehow?  
Someone said it is an algorithm to drop old content off of Popular sub 
Reddit itself has algorithms that lower the upvote count of popular posts so that r/all always has fresh content 
It had around 22k upvotes when I first saw and upvoted it. Now is below 7k. Bots? Dunno, I'm not a reddit expert. Can someone who's more informed on the issue please enlighten me? 
Around mid 21,000 or low 22,000. It's a shame, this is high quality post and was going to in the top of all time. 
Just basic motion tracking a point in the video and parenting it to the text. 
Plus not everyone sees all posts. I don't know how many times I've seen something cool for the first time only to see the comments are flooded with people complaining how many times it's been reposted. 
I fucking hate karma decay, its a nonsense way of keeping the front page fresh, but if people are still THAT happy with this post it should not be decayed until people are fucking done with it. Doesn't exactly motivate people to contribute to this shit system. 
Yup, packing up. Deleting account. Removing bookmark. Clearing all related cache. Blocking IP. This will how I choose to remember Reddit. 
Did you try turning it off and turning it back on again?  
Dude it was at 22,000. Something is wacky as shit here. There is no way that many people came and downvoted this! 
Hi. I'm still surprised by how well it was received. Lol, an AMA on me would be the most boring AMA ever.  :)  
I have upvoted almost every comment, but that's just one upvote. I can't account for the others, though. :) 
Lol, I'm rooting for you because you put as much effort into getting last comment as I did making the gif. Probably just one more week to go, buddy. :) 
Holy FUCK, I smirked the first time I read that, then I reread it and entered a vortex of despair. Dead on. DAMMIT  
Not teddy Roosevelt or george Washington? Just the one who supported welfare recipients 
At least we finally got a good PM here to hold up our half of North America. 
"If if if if if if if if" he had no teleprompter for once none of this would be true 
Could you imagine if guys like Teddy were internet era?  
He's planning on opening a beach front shop in Hawaii where he will sell nothing but plain white t-shirts 
Yeah, also I feel very safe with him in charge - I know he will be very cautious with regard to using our military and won't start a major war unless it's absolutely necessary, and he won't incite anger from potential enemies by being overtly disrespectful.  I don't like many of his policies (I'm mostly Libertarian), but between him, Trump, and Clinton I'd re-elect him in an instant.   
I truly appreciate people who can disagree with someone and yet still respect them as a person. 
It has everything - nostalgia, memes, a high quality image, and that air of wistfulness that belies change 
I think Michelle wants to be Oprah, not president. 
Having 18 years in so far,  i couldn't agree more.  He's been a respectable and noble leader.  
Lol, and my husband just said to me today "I HAVE TO GO BUY AMMO IT WILL ALL BE GONE TOMORROW!!" (If Hillary wins, he says). 
I am (mostly) a huge fan of Obama, but it's difficult to parse out what effects a president really has on a country, especially in regards to the economy.  That being said, on the bro-scale, Obama rates very high. He just seems like a good dude.  
I'm so happy for you. I lost my boyfriend last week due to depression. I'm so glad you're better now, and were able to get help.  
I would watch a Netflix show where Obama and George W Bush sit around and review movies together. 
Same with me. When my own family says it I hear "I wish you weren't alive". Then they get pissed I'm passionate about politics.  
Alright, you have to no rules mud wrestle one of the two nominees. Pick one go. 
"Didn't do much for me... will make 8k more a year" 
They teach us what to look for, but it's quite difficult in practice to spot such things.  To be honest, if this had been on my flight to Houston two days ago, I'd have just thought the dude was a jerk, and she was shy.  
When I worked as a park ranger I came across a couple (around 30) with two children (boy 7, girl 5) and what struck me as odd was the "parents" were disheveled, their clothes was older and worn, and they were obviously quite poor. Nothing wrong with all that; however, the kids were well dressed, clean, much more articulate than the parents, and just didn't really fit.  I spent hours looking through databases, making phone calls, and trying to find out something about an abduction that would match them. Went and spent time with them, not uncommon as a ranger and came to realize...  They were just good parents who did everything for their kids even when they couldn't do it for themselves. 
Yeah. Aren't human traffickers not nice ppl? I'd stay anonymous, thanks. 
He kidnapped and trafficked himself out of the country to avoid justice 
Sees girl going to bathroom, "Excuse me darling, I need to check something in there real quick before you go in."  
You know who are the clients of human traffickers? The richest people in the world (underage boys and girls are the most trafficked humans).  You know who decides where the money will be focused on? The richest people in the world. 
They're afraid of the person they're with, they have usually had a life where they couldn't trust anyone, they are broken down psychologically.  
According to the article, this happened 6 years ago. 
In the last airport I was in there were posters everywhere about signs of human trafficking, so this is probably more common than most people think.  
Yeah according to r/pics there are "15,000,000 photographers here" and by "photographers" they mean people who post shitty jpegs of people's headshots or pictures of signs 
Seriously though the way he does a reverse summersault and flips his legs back like that. That's some serious shit right there. 
5. Re-assess and identify secondary threat  6. Adjust momentum and reprioritize body position   7.  Lunge toward in-coming debris   8.  Use body to shield children from secondary threat  Time elapsed: 2.8 seconds.  
I'm surprised I had to scroll this far down to see this asked. First thing I noticed after the dodge, was that the kid in the white looked knocked out.  
You can see him pause for thought. He made the right choice and saved their lives.  
Can someone shop this gif so that the car crash never happens and he simply suplexes the kids? 
Might've heard the car getting closer than it should be, squealing tires, maybe they were honking? 
Wow, dude. That's a rough way to find out that his wife has been sleeping around. 
The adrenaline rush that comes with thinking that your kids are in real danger is like nothing else I've ever experienced. It really is the mental equivalent of being Clark Kent when he rips that shirt open to reveal the Superman emblem underneath.  
Someone else in the thread posted a slightly longer video of this. The guy hands off the kid in white to another person and the kid is conscious and looking around. If he did get knocked out, it was only for a fraction of a second. 
For all you know the driver is unconscious from an undiagnosed medical condition. 
Any slower and this video would have been on Liveleak.com.  
lol, hindsight. Anyone who has actually payed attention to Hillary the last 30 years knew she couldn't win against a wet towel. Some thought a orange toupee was shit enough to win against, but it wasn't. It was not even a minority opinion of Bernie supporters that this is what would happen. This is the same story I've been hearing since February at least. It was prophesied in fire in the sky but Hillary supporters couldn't see what was in front of their face. 
It's not just FPTP but a half dozen issues that are absolutely core to the rules by which the game of politics is played.   Money in politics, redistricting, FPTP and not a multi party system, the electoral college instead of a straight vote, anti democratic policies abound that favor the 2 established parties. The whole bit must go. 
**Democrats are burning for not feeling the Bern** 
I said something similar.  At the time, I'd conceded that Hillary might even make a better president than Obama.  But, like you, it was obvious to me that she could never win a general election.  She would have lost against Dole, Dubya, McCain, or Romney... not a doubt in my mind.   I thought Trump might be able to take her down, but the "grab them by the pussy" video, I thought, was the end of him.  Nope.  That's how much Republicans hate her.  They'll even take the sort-of-rapey guy over her. 
They already collected their checks for their online manipulation "job" 
This. I'm historically conservative and I can't stand Trump but Hillary was just too corrupt. As a conservative if it came down to Trump or Bernie. I'd choose Bernie simply because he seemed like a real earnest guy with America's best interest at heart.  Trump not so much.  
 .Democrats were arrogant after they turfed  Bernie . People don't want the establishment anymore . Voters for trump by in large are just ordinary people fed up with the establishment and democrats entrenched them by belittling them at every turn . You became the establishment they fought against.   
Yet alone doing this while also pushing this ridiculous "misogynistic Bernie bros" bullshit at the same time.  
And they will all walk off into the sunset with their money bags wondering how everyone else messed things up.  
THEY deserve to lose. But we don't. And we have to pay for their bullshit actions. 
As a non-american, who knows jack shit about elections in USA, how was it rigged? And if you are kind enough to explain it to me, i'd also ask you not to use acronyms, i'm likely not familiar with them. Thanks 
That's very well put. She lost to *TRUMP* for fuck's sake. A novelty candidate.  
For all the Hillary supporters who called me an idiot every time I said they were going to get Trump elected. Who's the idiot? 
Same here, never donated before in my life and I loved Obama. I hope DWS sees an end of her political career and a future in "Would you like fries with that?" 
It really was sickening seeing how truly desperate she was to win, with Bernie it felt like he was in it for us and not himself 
I'd love to say I told you so also, but if trump wins it looks like republicans are going to have the majority in the house, senate, AND the president. That's new levels of scary I didn't really even consider happening tonight. 
Knives are being readied in the DNC now I hope.  Two years of this then a Berniecrat landslide in the midterms. 
They wanted Hillary at any costs.   Elect Clinton or die tryin' 
I didn't agree with everything he had to say certainly, but out of anybody it seemed like he genuinely wanted to improve the country.  
Some networks have already called Wisconson for Trump 
I thought the GOP hated Trump and tried their hardest to replace him up to the primaries? It was only when he threatened to run as a 3rd party that he was able to wrangle the party into submission? 
Republican have to take the blame for Trump winning their primaries by stoking their base with misinformation, and Democrats have to take the blame for letting Trump win the election by being corrupt and neglecting their base causing them to not show up. Both parties fucked up. This is wholesale rejection of the current state of politics. This is what happens when you don't listen to the voters. I'm not saying any of this is the smart thing to do, but desperate people do desperate things. 
What if Trump gets sworn in and then immediately resigns...and explains how he only ran to prove he could win & to save America from the Clintons 
You really think the same people that stole the election from him would let him decide the budget. Seriously? Still? 
Goddamn idiots. Theyve ruined things for my children. We could have made real strides! We could have left parts of the past behind! 
Watching the blow-by-blow I reveld in how uncomfortable people like Chuck Todd were when it came time to anonce another state went to Trump.  He's a shit candidate but, watching this whole shit show crash and burn in front of them is satisfying to watch. 
Good morning, hope you aren't too fucked up from last night.  The shilling was bad. They pulled funding, you can immediately see because of this 20000+ upvoted post. 
I'd have liked an O'Malley v Kasich debate. They both seem like reasonable people who can articulate their points and have a meaningful, rational discussion. 
Bernie would have been a proud standard bearer of FDR & JFK's party. Hillary has no place standing among great leaders. 
The DNC, Team Clinton and the White House spent *years* making sure that Clinton would be the nominee.  
Remember when he won the Michigan primary and it was very unexpected? 
This has the potential to be equivalent to the Snowden leaks, but equally the public could lose interest pretty quickly.  Hopefully the former happens, and all those involved are prosecuted. 
Absolutely. It's incredible to see something like this in a sea of entertainment news garbage.  
Absolutely massive. Hopefully this leads to some actual change.  
Are you going to do anything to fix it?   Just caring isn't enough, people raising their fists through their computers does nothing, your votes have no impact so all people do is just complain.    Not saying I'll do anything about this either, but it's much more complicating than just caring.  Maybe a massive riot in the millions would change things over night, but that'll never happen.    People are too focused on trying to come up with a solution for the system by USING the system but fail to realize that the system is designed to avoid you from having any meaningful change to it.   
Right.. but how do we actually *do anything* when everyone we've put into a position of power is corrupt?   Seriously though. 
Not to sound like too much of a shill,  but I'm happy big outlets are slow with new big stories.  I expect a big fact checked non biased summary (bbc) but ultra quick reporting requires sloppiness. 
Watching the biggest news channel of france right now, waiting for this to be covered, 30 minutes of ads later, I thought they were preparing some statement about this, but no, talking about brussels, migrants, and the fucking weather.   And this is the "Week-end-Direct" program. 
I'm looking at Argentina. Those people don't fuck around when it comes to civil unrest.  
I never understand why people just toss off groups like Bilderberg as if they are not important.  There are well known clubs of the most powerful, most wealthy people on this planet. What do you think they talk about, their short game? They hold these meetings to set global policy and talk about how to get more money and more power for themselves.  
The real disappointment happens when nothing changes. 
Hey CNN decided to go with the "before she was Lady Gaga" story 
Already did that as soon as I saw the importance of this. 
All of a sudden "widespread terrorist attacks led by ISIS-Westboro cooperative" 
Apparently Americans are completely absent from the papers that have been leaked so far. That doesn't mean we'll hear more later as more of the papers are leaked.  
That is how sensationalist news covers things, it is one surprising headline after the other and old news doesn't catch headines like the latest celebrity gossip does. 
If you don't mind me asking, what's keeping you and your family there? I'm genuinely curious about the circumstances of you living there. 
There's options to fix things. There's expanding composite pipe for this type of job that goes in existing pipe and seals it back up. This would be very much cheaper than digging everything up and replacing it. This still isn't cheap and the problem is probably too big to fix.   The only thing that could reasonably done is a government substadized overhaul, which honestly isn't likely viable as how more difficult it is to fix utilities after shit is above it.   The government could buy out houses and such, but that opens up quite the can of worms.   Or do nothing. That's cheap and flint is a small sized town with not that many voters and support.... 
Yep. That's nuts. We can only hope wherever we buy our own a house the water is safe.. 
I'm sure that the people of flint are thinking the same thing  
Crazy that imaginary points and useless 'gold' matter to you. 
It's so true. People don't give two shits about local politics that's impact there lives daily.  
Have you seen the reservations? The Natives are pretty much relegated to the third world. 
It's fucking gallowboob. Don't expect effort. He's on the same tier as a shitty Facebook page.  
Congratulations, you just created a strategy for politicians to move populations they don't like, companies to get no-bid contracts to move them from their friends in the government, and an incentive for state and municipal governments to repeat the mistakes and crimes that caused the Flint water crisis in the first place. 
You could educated us and provide other examples of places facing similar problems.  
She *was* a blond white girl before they contaminated the water. 
I wish I could understand how they convinced the officials that they deserve the olympics. Are the Olympic officials trying to bankrupt shitty, oblivious countries on purpose now? Conspiracy? 
"Hey guys I found a loophole so we don't have to go die in Rio!"  "Drugs!" 
Go for it. I thought about doing it with zazzle or something but those guys would probably take it down for copyright infringement or something. Then again, I am also lazy. 
ISIS won't bother attacking because they'd be too terrified to go to Rio 
This needs more upvotes. Weapons grade wordplay is why I come to reddit most days 
If they can manage it... If you've seen the photos, it is a shame how Greece has let the 2004 Athens Olympics site go to a complete ruin a mere decade after the games happened. It's hard to imagine you could let brand new buildings rot so fast. And this was during a period where they were receiving significant EU subsidies.  Maybe the Olympics should be held in Greece, but managed by Germans or something. I don't have much confidence in the IOC's decision making wisdom. 
Parasailing isn't an olympic sport, now rowing and regular sailing are 
They expect our athletes, from all around the world, to compete in human excrement... It's *that* bad.  Russia getting caught doping doesn't seem all too bad now, wonder if the rest could "find new evidence" on every other competing country.  
Reddit waters down the upvotes so it won't stay forever there on the front page =) 
It really was.  I was living in Brazil at the time and nothing before has shown me how reddit is so full of people with very strong opinions on subjects they know nothing about.  The amount of quite disgusting and ignorant things said about a country of 200 million people completely blew my mind, it was so strange to see just how strongly people felt about what an irredeemable shit hole Brazil clearly is.  Any consensus about pretty much anything on this site has been suspect to me since then. I guess that's one positive to come from this? 
This is a stupid reddit mechanism. It always has been like that with popular topics 
Please don't let him turn into Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.   
Like, 3,000 up votes in less than 5 minutes. Damn.  
They weren't about to play that hurry-up music on old Leo and he knew it. 
Right. Leo strokes out on stage, Grohl comes out and restarts "Blackbird", someone up top throws together a quick Leo clip... 
Such a great closing line too. "Let us not take this planet for granted, I do not take tonight for granted."  
What if he counters by saying its not exactly 100? ;-; 
Until OP delivers, it is both a shitpost and not a shitpost at the same time. Schrodinger's Shit. 
Dude, you're taking such a risk right now by commenting this thread haha 
Even if the final price is around $2 million there are surprisingly many people who could pull it off.

I remember seeing a thread a while back where someone found him and got their picture taken with their crack out or something.   
Well, since the proper way to prepare yourself for this guy's freedom is to pull your pants up, ideally and theoretically 0.   We all know that won't happen.  But we also know he doesn't plan on taking anymore.  Someone else could if they wanted. 
My condolences to your sister.  I hope she recovers.  Where is she going to be marred? 
He already has the picture taken. Just like controlling diamonds, one must control the flow of crack to maximize karma. 
I won't lie to you you're my hero and got me to play magic I saw your post on reddit and I also had a few packs of journey to nyx from my local shop. You saved me from depression. You are a god amongst players. 
It seems like someone who's been banned from tournaments ever since the incident happened is the *last* person who'd know the answer to that question though.  
I find it's an excellent tool for keeping toddlers entertained on airplanes.  Also for making old people confused and vaguely bothered. 
Seriously, not even mentioning that this post is supremely uninterestimg 
honestly I had no idea it would blow up this much, the most I expected was 20k or something. this is insane! 
I hate that this sounds like actual dialogue from the prequels. 
I'll still be doing what I do now, only nobody will be paying attention by then. I'm surprised they are now.  
It's a replica. The original is retired, son to be auctioned for charity. I hope it's still worth something.   *Update* It raised $10,000 for Greater St Louis Honor Flight  
I'd like to imagine that got a solid eye brow raise from ken as he read this.  
I upvoted the post and then downvoted it just so I could get the satisfaction of upvoting it again 
At least one person lives Chase. I love Chase. My wife is right here, she thinks he's ok too. No strong feelings either way.  
As long as it gets you to the polls to vote on the other issues on your ballot. 
At least one person did, they posted it yesterday.  
I'm already a lazy mod in a few subs. That's enough responsibility to ignore for one man.  
ObiWan Kenboni sure knows how to ride the Front Page in style.

Yeah I was pretty pissed at that Bone hit piece. I literally threw my tendies because I was shaking.   "Oooooh, he likes to look at naked celebrities just like every other American man! What a villain!" 
Shit, Ken has my vote for most legendary redditor of all time. 
Ease of use and versatility. It's easy to pull on, and the zipper lets you customize the amount of shirt you want to show allowing it to be used with button downs, polos, or basic under shirts. 
Worse than that, it's a sweater. It was quite warm today too. 
What scares me is that you might actually be serious based on your username  
I hope they got 2nd place. I hope you won, obviously. 
None :( I spent like 8 entire minutes making this too.  
wouldn't an artificial sled simulation just be an actual sledding? 
I'm willing to bet it's not as enticing as you remember. 
Same here. RuneScape made typing easy eventually. My teacher said I was going to be a well paid secretary. 
Man those were the days, eh? Having to sneak out during lunchtime (it sucked when they were serving the round Red Baron pizzas, but what can you do?), head behind the school, score some white magic, adrenaline pumping, then head to the bathroom and use a suppository to get that ever elusive ecstasy. Ahhh, middle school memories always makes my butthole clench.  
Unless we can get 200.000+ signatures on change.org again.

I think you deserve all the luck in the world, but the way you've done this *might* be perceived as putting him on the spot in public.  You should maybe delete this comment and just PM or email the guy. 
Thank you! I really hope I live up to everyone's expectations. The good ones, at least. 
Of course that's what we're going to pretend. This is reddit. 
I feel weird when I even talk about Reddit IRL. I can't imagine being furious over it. 
I'm sure kn0thing is watching this with his bag of popcorn.

Breaking News: Dog memes on the rise /r/MemeEconomy  
black lab mix. looks very much like our lab/border collie mix 
My dog sits next to me while I am on my laptop and slowly shifts his weight so that he is nudging the computer off my lap and simultaneously inserting himself into that space.  If I let him do it, over the course of 5-10 minutes he will end up draped across my lap with his head on the keyboard.  And yes, it is very annoying. 
Exactly! Does no one on this bloody site understand what a nondisclosure agreement is? 
Could you shed some light on the "last employee"? Don't think I was around for that one.  
You either die an admin or live long enough to see yourself host your own AMA 
She could however talk about what she's going to do in the future and speak around anything an NDA would cover. 
More than that, I'm sure she signed an additional non-disparagement agreement in order to get her severance and continue benefits. Can't blame her.  Now, if someone else is somehow able to get the true story from her, he/she could convey it in a way that doesn't peg her as the source.  
It actually made it to 14K upvotes (twice). Both times upvotes were suddenly cut in half. Now its at 5K. Something's definitely up. 
Which they can, now. It's one, big, gay, whistleblower wedding! 
Ne questions, it just gets gilded like a million times.   Actually that would mean buying gold. Idk. Some shit along those lines.  
My guess is they are prepping for   1. Sale to an outside company.   2. Pay access.   And ditching people with issues with 1 and/or 2.   But im wrong a lot.  
Reddit's largest stake holder is Conde Nast, which is a subsidiary of Advance Publications, a multi-billion dollar enterprise. I really doubt any bigwig's contract includes a clause about getting bonuses of $4  
She got fired by the company. The website loves her.   
We might be taking a break from "Reddit Gold" for a while AutoModerator. 
What if she liked Dr. Pepper, ever thought of that smart Guy?  
I don't mean any offense, I know nothing about children. But is it possible to convince/teach him that he should not do that 
Being senile is great, you get a chance to meet new people everyday!  
I mean, I appreciated the shit out of my light up shoes when I was seven. I loved those things.  
Imagining that scenario gave me the biggest smile I've experienced in weeks.  
I love old man curses.  I say em all the time "Oh FOR THE LOVE OF  PETE"    My favorite is "OH FOR CRYIN IN A BUCKET" Close runners up would be dagnabit, and horsefeathers 
Even down to the wearing diapers and pooping your pants.  
The hate train came to town unfortunately and downvoted the living shit out of it afterwards.

Found the bot that will never show up in any my posts.  
It's there if you search images, just gotta scroll down a bit. 
Then the way he jumps up to his face like it's a romantic movie. 
If I dressed up as my dog's favorite thing I would be a turd. He doesn't play with toys but he loves to eat his own poop. 
Like when Lloyde told Harry  "She actually talked to me" 
And the moment it sniffs and knows precisely who it is. 
was convinced it was going to be the dog panicking and running away for a cheap laugh. pleasantly surprised when the dog approached with reverence and awe. 
Mine too. I buy a couple of cheap plush toys for him to destroy every so often.   Have you ever seen a wolf pulling the fur off of its food?  
I think that really captures the feel of WWI. Like, "Last month I was a dirt farmer and now the sky is falling"  
He runs to the end of the zeppelin and jumps off doing a 360 no scope to an enemy pilot and then lands in the cockpit of the stolen plane and flies off into the sunset  
Someone needs to make a 'behind the gif' of this...  
Seriously, that was probably the coolest BF video I've ever seen even if it was something so simple. 
*"I saw him deploy a parachute at 100 feet! His genes need to carry on"* 
"Oh crap oh crap oh crap, oh crap on a CRAP CRACKER!" 
Dishonor! Dishonor on you!  Dishonor on your family! Dishonor on your cow! 
In reality, Zeppelins could fly high enough that most planes' and ground-based weapons couldn't reach them. Also, their interiors were segmented so a few punctures wouldn't deflate them, and regular bullets and shrapnel proved not to ignite them. Special explosive and incendiary rounds had to be developed to do the job.  When the war began, zeppelins were the most developed form of aviation in the world, and were the one area where Germany were firmly ahead of everyone else. It would have been dumb *not* to try to use them to their advantage, despite their vulnerabilities.   
It feels awesome. Being a quadriplegic comes with a lot of mental anguish so when these kind of things happen it really puts your mind at ease and makes you feel hopeful. 
I usually do my rehab in Baltimore at Kennedy Krieger Institute but lately I've been doing it at sheltering arms in Richmond because I applied to VCU so I'm giving this place a test run in case I move there 
It's kind of like a Segway. You lean forward and it starts walking. My physical therapist also has it synced up to an iPhone app to help control it. 
I haven't. I broke my neck in a BMX accident 8 years ago. Of course walking unassisted is unbeatable but this is still pretty damn awesome. I forgot how tall I am when I'm walking. It's also really weird looking down and seeing my feet move underneath me since I still can't feel my legs. 
DUN-DUN-DUUNNN-DUN-DUN-DADUUNN-DUN-DUN-DUNNN-DUN-DUUUNNNN!!! \m/ 
Well they did just send the exoskeleton to get upgraded recently so fingers crossed for wall walking 
Not dumb at all. Lots of quadriplegics have muscle spasms constantly anyways. Some more severe than others. Everything definitely feels numb. As far as putting a hotplate on my leg or feeling pain, my body feels it but I don't. It Triggers what's called autonomic dysreflexia. So basically since I can't feel it my body's response is to raise my blood pressure very high to the point where I get really bad headaches and I get cold sweats. And this usually doesn't go away till I find the cause of it.  
Not a dick. It's extremely hard to offend me. Rebel scum... 
How have things been for you since leaving the hospital?  Was the first drive home pretty difficult for you?  Hope you're doing well man 
And a couple of hundred years into the future no one will give him or any others of us here any second thought as our existence has faded into obscurity and no one will never know we existed. 
I can. I asked them to turn on the breakdance feature but they said I have been earned that yet 
Hey good luck to the two of you. I believe he mentioned it further up if you haven't seen it yet. It's not the same but I was just bedridden and told that I may be disabled, for about 8 months and then I slowly got better, but it was definitely very tough. Hope you find something that helps! I wonder if they make exoskeletons for activities of daily living (ADL). They must, it'd be strange if they don't. 
8 years. I've been doing physical therapy since the injury but Just started using the exoskeleton in September. Long term goals I guess would be walking and independence 
What do you want to know? I'll answer any question you throw at me. 
Most quadriplegic men are able to get a priapism (hard on) by reflexive action (messages from dick to spinal cord still work - they just don't send that message to the brain and vice Versa). Some hard ons will last longer than others - just like most men. So yes for 'most' spinal-cord injured men their dick still works. (Some may need medication to help)  However not all SCI men will be able to feel the same sensation (if any) like they did pre injury. However they might have deeper / altered sensation so having a body banging next to them will still register - and then there's always visuals to keep you going.   I personally think it's good to ask. It's good to see people with disabilities as the 'same' in the sense that we are all, generally speaking, sexual beings and why should that change just because you happen to have a disability.

On the pod cast 99percent invisible he does a whole episode about Obama and the letters he receive, "ten letters to the president"  
Fun fact: the Lincolns, before the Presidency, were well to do, and enjoyed the Victorian luxury of separate bedrooms. 
And then make a film about it and call it Hateful Eight. 
It's nice to be able to disagree with someone on policy, but still be able to realize they are a good person. 
Racial resentment is playing a huge part. I have been realizing more as the years go by that we would "pay" for daring to elect him before addressing deep rooted social racism. I think we needed him, but I also wish we could cryonically freeze him for better times. Hmm.. I wonder if we can clone him.  Anyway, I hope they remain an influential family. We minorities need a level headed hero to remind us of what is possible. 
President Obama is a great example for your husband, handling pressure and resistance with grace and dignity. I hope your husband's tenure gets easier as well as rewarding. And girl, kudos to you, you're married to a mayor!  
Fuck, no. Could you imagine if Trump actually turned up? I wouldn't even take the risk. 
As an aussie, when our last prime minister suggests that too many trees are 'locked up in nature reserve' and need to be 'freed', we knew he had to go  
Dear OP,  I'm glad that you like our parks. We have the best parks. Our parks are so great. All these other countries, their parks are total disasters.    
Yeah, we're really sorry. Well about 25% of us are sorry. About 25% are thrilled, and the other half or so apparently can't be bothered to give a shit one way or the other. 
Because we (as a majority, not me personally) are angry and when we're angry we make rash decisions. 
I live in Australia and have never been in snow, so forgive me if this is a stupid question but:  What the fuck did they think was going to happen? I mean the snow isn't hidden, it's *right there* and it seems obvious that the snow is going to get rapidly displaced when the train arrives.  Did they think it was just going to get squished down small or something? 
They had like 10 seconds to respond and run.  Maybe even longer depending on how slow their internet connection was.   
The platform could form a spot for the snow to drift.  
As an Englishman, I agree! I'm also irritated that there was no personnel there to stop people from going to the platform.  
They will have to put a stamp on the phone: "things you see through your camera may be closer than they appear on your screen - baaang"    The bang is for what will happen anyway... 
Unfortunately only one phone was recovered. This is the unedited footage.   *Warning: The following clip may be disturbing to some viewers.* 
Some did- you can see them moving back at the beginning. 
I'm confident that the first time I find one, the plainclothes officer will be there to arrest me. 
Reason #749 why banks being closed on the weekends makes no sense.    /bitter guy who gets paid on Fridays who is fed up with not being able to access his money until Wednesday morning because the bank isn't open until Monday, but they process everything deposited on Monday, on Tuesday morning, and require 24hrs before funds become available.   
Shake it once, that's fine  Shake it twice, that's okay  Shake it three times, you're playing with yourself  
That would just mean the scammer could max out your card + whatever negative balance on the account. It's a better plan to just keep your CC maxed and ur bank acct empty 
Exactly, why not just make the face completely flat with a flush slot in it, then any protrusion would be immediately obvious. 
I almost always check my ATMs now (when I remember too). I don't know why these devices make me feel so uncomfortable.  They're like those creep-crawly sci-fi **brain bugs** that attach to your spine and control your mind, but you never know it's attached until it's too late...   
Wonder how many were found that caused them to implement that policy.  That the the less comforting part. 
Just imagine how many are looking at this thread as a potential new source of income. 
Better drill all the way into the interior and check the cash-dispensing mechanism, just to be sure. 
Instructions unclear. Ended up beating up a fellow redditor who checked the ATM for skimmers and found it cause I thought he was the thief  
Does a huge steel door slam down cutting off the hands or fingers of the person who was using it? One can only hope.  
Po: "It's bad to break stuff"  OP: "Stuff was easy to break..."  Po: "Hmm... Should we try break the other stuff to see if ez to break?"  Po: "Other stuff was apparently virus stuff. You free to go." 
See you people and your fancy plastic cards are going to get screwed by identity theft. That's why I only use old world currency Like livestock and hookers.  
Maybe he's the person who installed the skimmer... or maybe he's clueless. Hard to know for sure 
Keep that up and you might wind up President of the United States.  
Honest question, even if I have a chip on my card, isn't the skimmer still getting my info from the magnetic strip anyway?    For all the places in the US where you see the sign 'NO CHIP', the magnetic strip works fine. 
Don't be paranoid, be aware and in the know because it's half the battle.  
Hi this is the ^bank.  Please be so kind to copy and paste your debit card number and an expiration date and my colleges and I will check your card to see if has been stolen.  Thank you for using ^bank, and have wonderful day.   
If they do this, do you really think they give 2 shits whether it is right or wrong? 
Better Idea: Or they could embed a pair of modulated IR LEDs pointed outwards from the card reader (hidden behind perspex) and every so often turn them on to see if there is anything obscuring that area like a skimmer. If there is then the ATM should alert the bank/authorities.  Now you don't have to deal with anything sticking out, no need for movable parts, and it would not be obvious. Location around the card reader slot can be randomized so that the thieves would not know where the sensors are.  False positives would be avoided by having a time out feature so that a person using an ATM who may just have his/her hand obscuring the sensor would not be registered. Something like if it is obscured for more than a minute or two then there may be a skimmer rather than a hand. 
Heh. I work in the credit card processing industry. There are so many reasons to hate humanity in this business. Scammers skimming. Machine leasers ripping businesses off. Shell games, shady crap. We try to fight it, but. David, Goliath, etc. 
Sure, just give me your 16 digit card number, cvv code, zip code, and pin number so I can bill the postage to you. 
Some of the more advanced ones use bluetooth. Gas pumps and self-checkout lanes in grocery stores are big targets for these.  
I haven't found one but if I did - I would call the police and get their advice! 
Plus, she made it into a (dumb, might I add) political video accusing Trump of hiring people to kill opposition. I mean, I really think people are going a little too far with this hate/terror speech.  
Going to reply here since it's at the top currently -  @OP - you need to report their video.  - Click ---more then report  - Infringes on my rights  That should lead you to another page where you can select "Copyright infringement (Someone copied my creation)"  I'll admit I don't know how they handle this stuff, does something you create and upload automatically have a copyright? Anyway that's probably the best thing you can do. 
Not to mention the horrible idea to use masks. Loved that it was an actual person in the original. Seemed more real 
If you watch the entire thing, the big twist is the guy with the finger guns was Trump!!! What a twist. 
Right? It greatly annoyed me that they used a handwritten check with $1 million dollars on it.  Then she doesn't know it was from Trump until she gets the note, but then it flashes back to her seeing Trump at the end.  Original video was acted and produced so much better from start to finish. 
Right? There's definitely way less cleavage in our version. Maybe that's what we're missing... 
What a about "An Ivanaa creation" or whatever her name is at the start.  
Yeah, this seems like something h3h3 would definitely enjoy talking about.    
I'm sending it to everyone, that ending had me in tears 
She doesn't even act it out well. The original guy at least looks disheveled. She looks like she just stepped out of her makeup trailer. 
I just hope they keep it about the plagiarism and not do what Youtube commenters always do, and migrate towards attacking ethnicity or gender, completely negating any criticisms and negatively tainting the protests. Then she looks like a victim. Then Jezebel starts an article about the injustice against her, a legion of women descend on the issue, and before you know it, the world has ended and *Nyarlathotep the Crawling Chaos* has made _Earth HIS BITCH_.            Alright I might have gradually started talking about Lovecraft but you know what my point was.  
PhillyD would be a good call for something like this. 
That was my first thought.  I'm suspicious of everything these days.  OP's title just said to me: "Watch my video." 
you know, making this a link would have been useful.  
He's from Virginia and was involved with the sentencing of our corrupt Republican governor (McDonnell - "indicted on federal corruption charges for receiving improper gifts and loans from a Virginia businessman").  Boente stated "No one is above the law... not a high public official, not even the highest public official in [Virginia]."  Interesting pick. 
Dude it's going to suck in May. This is reality now. This is the new normal. 
Wiki changes fast with news, those sections won't be reliable for a few days at least. 
Very bad. Presidential cabinet positions exist to advise the president. Trump did not allow her to see the executive order before issuing it. 
I can dig it.  The left's bench is pretty fucking light these days.   "Fell on sword to defend constitution against orange nemisis" is some easy to spin bona fides.  
My first political memory is Watergate and the resignation.  You aren't wrong here at all. 
Until you realize trump could cut the cord in the mission to save money.  
Trumps on a straight path to being impeached. My theory is, is that this is what the GOP wants. They'll let him go crazy, get impeached, and then Pence will be in office. After Trumps craziness everyone won't both the GOP too much with their laws because they won't be as crazy as Trumps. It's the perfect bamboozle, just a theory though.  
imo the scary part is that this was never run by her beforehand, because Trump presumably knew the answer already.  So he puts it in her court, publicly, knowing very well she would object.  Now she's publicly defying the president, and her firing is the next logical step.  Seems very calculated. 
The greatest thing that can come of this is a renewed public interest in politics and a strengthening of the legislative branch 
Which is ironic considering he doesn't trust vaccines  
/u/Evoxio better send it in! It's certainly worthy. 
I give it 12 hours before the Facebook post:  "On July 25, 2016, God performed a miracle. In the two cities struck by this same bolt of lightning, two children were dying of cancer. God struck them at the same time and cured both instantly, leaving doctors and scientists baffled.   LIBERALS SAY MIRACLES DON'T HAPPEN BUT THIS IS PROOF!!! LIKE AND SHARE TO SPREAD THE WORD OF GOD'S GREAT POWER!" 
Had I not known any better, I would have thought someone drew the lightning on paint or something. 
As someone who caught a CP 97 Rhydon today... -_-  Still, nice to add something new I guess.  
I would absolutely love this on my computer as well. What an incredible shot... 
this is a picture of jersey city, taken from nyc.  that's exchange place in the photo  
I don't think I've ever been through a thunderstorm like that in NYC. I visit family here rather often and the storms usually ain't much. This one was fun, especially in the UES with the thunder booming off the buildings! 
that is how you get lightning shots. probably a long exposure to get the lightning layered with a long exposure for everything else. this erases most of the reflections on the water and makes everything look nice. 
The storms we just had in the nyc area were obscenely heavy. Some of the heaviest I've seen. Now, to anyone from somewhere they get real weather, feel free to call me a pansy. But today's storms were no joke. 
Tripod and a long exposure and what seems like a healthy bit of editing 
Look at those upvotes rise to drown out what is actually going on. Impossible upvotes. 
You may be on to something. The bolt that hits the tree is the same diameter as the bolt that hits the building across the river. It's as if the bolt is on the same plane rather than having any sense of depth, such as the depth between the trees on this side of the river and the building across the river.  
It's got to be multiple exposures, at the very least. 
Everyone on the stage wrote their own questions.  We shared them with the moderators, then the mods got to as many as possible while maintaining the flow of the debate. 
I saw a man with no teeth and no shoes standing on a corner in my new hometown when I moved there 3 years ago as I'm driving the moving van.  Here I am bringing all my stuff to a bigger, better house, thinking what hot shit I am for affording the place.    Then I see him and realize that he has literally nothing but the sign in his hand.  People driving by him giving him no more mind than a street sign or a shrub.  I drove on by, reasoning that I was too busy to stop and help him out, it was moving day.  Somebody else will give him a couple bucks.  I never saw him again.    Is he OK?  Did he move on out of town?  Turn his life around?  Die in a gutter OD'd on heroin?  I'll never know cause I didn't give him the time of day.  I was too busy pretending I had arrived.    These are people who deserve love and happiness as much as me or anyone.  But that day to me he was a shrub.  Never again. 
Too many weird, wild things to count.  The most surreal was hearing back from @midnight which I love. 
Fake internet points are the best compensation.  Except money.  I likes money. 
Gallup does a random sampling of undecided voters in the area in which the debate is held.  This time it was my home town and I was lucky enough to answer when they called. 
Between that and what South Park might turn me into I'm pumped.  I know Bobby Moynihan would crush the bit, but maybe go Leslie Jones for shock value or something?  I don't know.  I'll get with my writers. 
St. Patrick center provides temporary housing, job training, drug counseling, and help with mental health issues.  There is a severe homelessness problem in this country.  Most of us are one or two paychecks away from being homeless as well.  We need to start seeing and intervening on their behalf.   
I'm already the sexy Ken Bone so I'm thinking bust out the old Jedi robe / lightsaber combo and be Obi Wan Kenboni 
We need more clean plants like mine to be approved for construction.  Older plants can't retrofit to be best in class environmentally because it would drive them out of business. That means we need newer ones manned by the displaced workers from those being retired. 
Be who you are.  If people don't like who you are, they're not the right people to have in your life. 
Several companies have approached me for endorsements. I have 2 rules for working with them.  1)It's a responsible company that I believe in and that I vet to the best of my ability.  I will do my best not to associate with any companies that hurt the environment or their workers.  2)  10% of all money I receive must go to my local preferred homeless charity the Saint Patrick Center in Saint Louis, MO.  Same rules for paid appearances. 
My uncle called me today and seemed genuinely star struck as if we hadn't been drinking beer together the week before. 
Radiohead is my all time favorite, nobody blends genres like Thom Yorke and the boys. 
I know I look old cause I'm fat and bald and dress like it's 1954, but I'm only 34 and ineligible to run!  There are over 2000, yes 2000 legally registered candidates.  One of them must have something to offer.  Get your voice out there for one of them.  
Obviously reducing energy usage in the winter by providing everyone with stylish red cable knit sweaters, duh.  
He talked to me about the peak of the coal industry in the 20s and how it has evolved with the nation's infrastructure over the years.    Then his security team reminded him that it was time to go yet again.  I think his wife was waiting on him. 
On soft ball and hockey rec teams I wore 18 for the great 60s era Saint Louis Cardinal Mike Shannon.  He's been the voice of the Cardinals basically my whole life.  Stan Gibson is for Stan Musial and Bob Gibson. 
He sort of? answered this on his Jimmy Kimmel appearance I think, basically said he turned on his cell phone as soon as he was allowed and had a thousand+ messages lol 
I'm sorry you're confused, Ken Bone is the cable knit sweater wearing a fat guy. 
Ken Bone does not ask.  He commands by his imposing yet cuddly presence. 
Yes, definitely.  Being undecided is not the same as being indecisive.  We just have a lot to consider this election.   
My power plant supports a robust drug testing policy, sorry Dogg.  My dad on the other hand is all in. 
I'm close, but I will not be announcing my decision.  I want you to all make up your own minds.  Don't rely on my opinion, just the positive message. 
It's been unreal, both the good and the bad.  Everybody has responded to the positive message with the exception of a few nuts.  Some of the stuff makes it tough to stay positive, but I try to spin it for the good.  For instance, I've had almost a quarter million new Twitter followers, and only 3 death threats.  Great ratio!  Seriously though, thanks to my home town PD for making me feel safe when the creeps come out to play. 
I wanted to hear more about environmental protection from Mr. Trump, and more about jobs from Secretary Clinton.   They both did alright, but all answers from politicians are pretty much canned and rehearsed.  Kinda like the ones I do on the radio. 
It was a bad call.  I need to fire my agent, except I can't because I'm my agent. 
It's flattering, but please don't.  I cannot serve since I'm not old enough. 
Somebody set one up on my behalf, but Jimmy Kimmel is buying me a new one since I did his show.  I guess if go fund me sends me that money it'll go to the charity.    You'll see me wearing it on his show next week. 
I had this weird hallucination where all the sudden everyone gave a shit what I had to say.  Bizarre. 
I don't even go to HOA meetings,  but if I really thought I could effect positive change I'd consider it. 
I'm in LA late next week, maybe we can hook up. Big fan here. My dad wants to roll wit da Dogg big time, you me and him could do some tight stuff.  That didn't sound cool at all, did it? 
Without our future generations of doctors we can never solve the healthcare dilemma in this country! You are the future! You are going to improve the lives of your future patients and their families every day for the rest of your life!  Stick it out, I know you are sacrificing a lot, but they need you. 
We both worked at a bowling alley in Granite City called AMF Bowland.  I was a lane attendant which meant I walked around cleaning, throwing away beer bottles, and getting stuff from storage over to the bar and snack bar to restock during shift.  She worked the snack bar, which meant I did none of the stuff listed above.  I just watched her clean the grill cause when she bent to scrub it I could see dat ass was fat. 
Only the head nurse was able to speak up about it.   
Any president would be instantly twice as good for the country with this one simple step.  Appoint experts in each respective field to cabinet positions.  NOT political donors or old friends I owed a favor.   2nd action, get blasted at camp David till I pass out. 
I have 4 cats. 1) Angel Female, a mostly white calico.  She was a Christmas present to my wife.  We were too broke for me to get her a gift while I was working through school.  I surprised her with a kitten that a coworkers cat had.  I wrapped a cat collar in an old jewelry clamshell and put it under the tree.  Heather and Angel are friends forever.  2) Daisey - Female, a tortie with white gloves and ascot.  My BFF.  She was a full grown cat we adopted from a shelter at about 1 year of age the Christmas after Angel.  3)  Zero - Male.  My son named him after the Borderlands character.  Black with wisps of gray.  Rescued from the shelter as a little kitten.  Chosen by our son.  Name changed from Ringo when we adopted him.  4)  Shadow - Male.  An asshole we lured inside.  He was a stray living in our storm drain, a small kitten weaned too early.  Heater got him inside.  He loves to piss on stuff sometimes, but for some reason we still like him. 
They have been thinking it since the days of my great grandfather (swear on my life it's true) Bentley Bone and his son, my great uncle Oriel (pronounced Oral) Bone. 
When it's cold in your jail cell.  I'm not big on stripes.   
What's an NFL?  I'm from St. Louis, something called an NFL has abandoned my twice in my lifetime already.  That's more times than a typical dead beat dad and still they want my money.  Not happening. 
The mods got to as many as time permitted, but we did not know the order.  The reason is, let's say the economy discussion is going great, they do another audience question on it.  Name calling gets out of hand again? Total topic change, skip all the rest on the economy.  Because of this mod controlled flow we got a better discussion, but the audience has no warning that their question is coming. 
Had a goatee for a while, full on neck beard for about a year.  Clean shaven for a long time.  The stache is for my grandpa, the first Ken Bone who tied in (not lost, it died too) his battle with cancer two days before Christmas last year.  His stache was unparalleled.   
I breathe the same air and drink the same water as you.  My job doesn't change that.  We only get one Earth and we're doing a shit job taking care of her.  I feel that my plant is operating in a responsible way, but as a whole we are going to need big energy innovation if we want our grand kids to have the same planet we do. 
We don't take kindly to people who don't take kindly to things. 
I'm a Texan Muslim.      You're right! I was pleasantly surprised to find that out for myself. 
Same here. Maybe I'm more prejudiced than I like to think 
He's actually in front of the Mexican Taco joint.  
I believe/hope that you are wrong. For instance, you just described me politically, and I'm sure a lot of other Redditors sitting on their toilets right now as well.  I think that the two extremes of each side would have us believe that we're more different than we really are. I look at all of this "WE ARE SO DIVIDED" on TV and think to myself: "Probably not, in reality." 
Also you drive for 2 days and you're still in Texas. The fuck! 
Austin is nothing like the rest of Texas.  Austin is amazing. 
Texas's cities are very tolerant yes. the trick with Texas is there's a lot of people NOT living in the cities as well, and out there it gets not so tolerant at all. 
Pines trees. I'm in East Texas. Hate em.  Dang things shoot up to 100ft with practically 6 inches of root system, and then fall on your house at the next ice storm or heavy wind.  Stupid freaking pine trees. 
I wouldn't be suprised if Texas has more of these.  
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not his own reality.  Do not expect people to respect and coddle the fantasies of others. 
Cool guy online mocks people for liking things that make them feel good, is very edgy, very cool, very fringe. 
Wow, that's a Frank dog.  Just started watching that show recently.  Pretty good so far, almost finished with season 1, will probably give season 2 a shot. 
And then sniffed the ass where that shit came from. 
Me too, but in a brother-sister sense.  "Imma just gunna take a selfie here in this nice forest.  Just caught a mouse and gave the heart to my owner.  She was disgusted...it was awesome!  "Alright...a little higher...fluff out the whiskers...blink a little for the cute eyes...aaaaand..."  "Heyea sis!  Whatcha doin'?!"  CLICK 
The cat used its cellphones front facing camera. Not all that complicated. 
I'm glad someone else noticed the intern - that dude is swept away.  
The Right Honourable Prime Minister Steal Yo' Girl 
The rolled up sleeves look is really flattering, too. 
Can confirm, it's weird hearing all of my family in AB spit hatred about Trudeau and what a terrible job he's doing, especially after getting major pipelines approved for the province (something I don't think Harper ever could have done). Everyone I talk to in BC that doesn't like him is due to either actually approving those same pipelines or his flip-flop on changing the electoral system. Most people I talk to love him though.  
He goes for a handshake and you kiss his hand instead?  
I feel like most guys may have had a woman give them that look before, but like most pics, they're looking in another direction.  
Her mother was quite a beauty.  And really, Trump wasn't a bad looking guy in his youth - it's just the years of smug that have built up.  And the horrible fake orange tan and comb over. 
The King In The North takes what he pleases. Winter's not the only thing coming 
This is so true, I used to have his teen beat posters on my wall lol. If he had hair again he'd probably still look very handsome. I mean Harry does.  
You should listen to the joint press conference that he gave with Drump. He answered in English and French, and he sounds like a drang HUNK. 
Any time I hear someone use the word "cuck" my immediate thought is "this dude has never had sex".  
Men can ovulate if they want, don't let that this matriarchal society make you think different. 
I think you mean articulate.  The vast majority of politicians are articulated. 
Seriously, nothing that anybody can say will convince me that that's not Eric Cartman. That's Eric Cartman. 
It's ok. Butters can get that safe space up and running in no time. 
You just learned that?  They filmed an entire season with stop motion cardboard circles moving around. 
Do you get my explanation? Or do you need a demonstration? 
Friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation! 
Dumbass. ^Just ^a ^reference. ^^Nothing ^^personal. 
Dennis' "Pretty sure you did" was perfect. Wording, delivery and tone... 
I love when RP accounts follow through. Best of luck with your Greek prostitutes and Phoenician destruction.   
Read this as George Constanza. "I don't wanna walk through the puddle!" replied, Jerry. "You got some of those Nazi boots, didn't you?" said Kramer. 
Dammit, Himmler, I never said get rid of the JEWS, I said get rid of the SHOES!   
Square-cube law! Grip friction goes up as square of size, weight goes up as the cube. It's also why little kids can fall hard and not get nearly as hurt as an adult would. 
I got to fly in and out Detroit yesterday and today. I get motion sick, and we circled Detroit before landing yesterday. It was fucking miserable. Today I took Dramamine and did much better landing in Detroit.   I'm half surprised that whole area of the US is still there today. So windy.  
A pump at minimum, and many come with a spring / safety chain to prevent the above from happening when the pump is disconnected to open the door further. 
How do you envision "door" and "dor" being pronounced differently? 
When you're 3, and new shit is happening every day, you don't know that a strong dust devil isn't so out of the ordinary. 
serious question.... after a 5 second review of your comment history, i see you comment a lot on Xbox forums.  How do you game without using your arms? 
I'm paralyzed. I told maybe like 2 ex girlfriends and 5 normal friends when i got my shit to work finally. Its like flying an airplane blindfolded only using a jerkoff stroke on the joystick. You don't realize how much your top head controls when your bottom head blows 
I guess it would depend on how far below the waist they are paralyzed.   If he can still have sex,  I assume he can feel it.  
Much like her husband, about the only thing she uses is Head & Shoulders.  
you are 2 for 2 on some bastard gold in this thread. 
No, it will grow up hating the elderly for assuming a handicap pass comes with your social security card at 65 no matter how able you are 
Spinal cord injury paraplegic here.  You'd be surprised what you are capable of when it happens to you.  I always thought the same thing.  4.5 years later, I'm no less happy than your average American. 
haha well I wasn't there to witness the act, but based on the writing on the wall i'd assume it was all natural ;) 
My dad never played with me fully and I've never been to Disney land. My dads also not paralyzed.  
It's our turn to defend the immigrants who defended us. 
That was a dark day for me. I was on the verge of browsing fark. Luckily, I stumbled on pornhub first. Still, it was a little too close for comfort.  
My Iranian friend in college fled the oppressive government and his family has resettled in the US. He is one of the kindest people I've ever met, he has an American flag in it's flagpole sitting in his room, and he has nothing but love for our nation. You and him both make our nation stronger, I'm sorry we are all quickly becoming strangers in this country.  
There are lots of positive comments in this thread. People telling their stories about how the United States came to be--a group of people who believe in the dream of freedom and some who came here from other countries to sacrifice for our freedoms by fighting and defending our way of life that allowed for them to be here in the first place. We are a united place--and that hasn't been defeated yet. Keep your head up! "The people--united--will never be defeated". We need to be reminded of what makes this country positively great, and that's all the people from all over who have come to live and risk their lives for the Freedom of America. If we aren't reminded, we simply become complacent. And that is the last thing we need right now.   I hope you are having a good day, too. Thanks for wishing it to me!  
My father was a Syrian immigrant. My cousin is currently in this country with asylum. His father was tortured to death.  He's very smart. He has a full ride (and a near 4.0) at his college, in his third year of his Chemical Engineering major.   He went on a co-op last year in Germany. This year he won't be able to go again.   He visited his family. His mother and younger sister have resigned to not seeing him for at least 4 more years.   This sucks. Thank you guys for taking a stand. 
I think we can give OP a pass on this one since he's *the* OP. 
She's a nice lady and you should be ashamed of yourself.  
Search Jim benton anywhere and you will find his website, twitter and such. Plus its watermarked with his website if you don't even wanna do that. 
that's like, the best thing I can hear about a cartoon, meltman27. thanks. 
Thanks, GeekofFury. I'm told I can exchange these points for stuff, like tickets at a chuckie cheese. now where's that prize counter.... 
You monster! Still, upvote for being honest about your mental illness. 
or "check out my mom, she was a total babe in the 80's, she made this cartoon.." 
Either that or my finger would be covering the lense 
Some people don't care about IP and just want to share things they made. 
Are you doing it as a career, or just for funzies? I'm like 3 classes away from getting my Associates of Visual Arts, and am starting to think it's about as useful as a poopie flavored lollipop... 
Poor OP is not going to be able to handle the pressure... he's going to sit at the same spot for the rest of his life trying to re-capture the image to deliver for reddit.... 
iPhones have burst mode which makes lightning shots very simple too.  
Yeh, there's no way it came out of the iPhone looking like that. 
It's actually not. Complete freak accident that I captured lightning. It hadn't lightninged all night, and this was the first one, was honestly just trying to grab a picture of the cloud 
all with an iPhone. OP should contact Apple. They might use his picture for viral marketing for the iPhone. 
He accurately predicted the lightning strike and was able to time his lens shutter just right.  That same lightning bolt took 10 attempts. 
You're about to learn a whole fuck load of things you never knew about civics and society. 
That's pretty much what he tweeted a few hours ago 
I'm pretty sure that Trump could murder someone on camera, then the next day claim that it didn't happen or people are remembering it wrong, then his supporters would call it a hoax.   
This isn't a red flag when everything this man does is a red flag. Trumps campaign slogan "Make America Great Again" should be on a giant red flag and parroted around like a giant FU to everyone who knew better. And what's worse, he's turning Old Glory into No Glory. 
It's not a story the Democrats would tell you.  It's a Republican legend.  Darth Trump was a Dark Lord of the Alt-Right, so bigly and so tremendous that he could influence his supporters to lie about pretty much everything.  He had such a knowledge of alternative facts that he could even keep the more qualified candidates he was running against... from winning.  The Alt-Right is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be full-on fascist.  He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was having a small inauguration crowd, which eventually of course, he did.  Unfortunately, he taught Steve Bannon everything he knew, then Steve Bannon took over the government in his sleep.  It's ironic; he could save others from fake news, but not himself.  Sad! 
What did she do to stand up to Trump? Not sarcastic. 
I think Trump fired her, or whatever presidents do to people in those positions.  
Except when God-Emperor Trump leads humanity to a golden age under the Pax Americana. /s 
Thank David Brock and his $40 million donation to "Share Blue." The information war continues. 
First... They came for /r/politics, but I said nothing, for I was not a subscriber... 
Everything is r/liberal except r/the_donald. This is how reddit dies. When the admins are so focused on their political view they suppress anything that opposes it. You would think 99% of Americans hate trump if this us all you see but recent polls show nearly 60% agree with that immigration ban. The reddit trump outrage is fabricated. 
I'm getting a funny feeling that this isn't organic.  It's just a hunch but I think we're seeing a resurgence of the paid trolls we saw so much of before the election.  Only now they're more organized and they have a bigger budget. 
This is almost as bad as using a blog post to make a political statement. 
Careful.  Rational, level-headed comments such as these will get you downvoted to oblivion.  Tread carefully! 
The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) reviewed the order and deemed it lawful, which she admitted in her statement 
This is fucking it, I'm done, I hoped this sub would improve a little after the election, it's just gotten worse 
Shhhhhh no logic here it triggers the little delicate ones 
Seriously, every major subreddit is awash with this garbage now.   I used to hate it but the /r/videos "no politics" rule is looking pretty attractive to me right about now. 
Asking  the guy who edited pro Trump posts to end anti Trump spam. Funny. Have you not seen the alien on the main page or the sticky blog?   They are 200% anti Trump.  
Religions don't issue marriage licenses in the US. 
By denying the US government its day in court? How can you preserve, protect, and defend when one of the litigants doesn't even show up? 
She did her job and was fired for it.  Her job is to stand up to this bullshit. 
That's not how public service works. First and foremost, you serve the people. 
1:40 for me. "There must be a lot of nevers because this is pretty subtle." I'm not a smart man. 
My attitude is I already gave it another view, so might as well ride this sucker out until the end.  
It is the closest thing to a classic meme I think. Most others go in and out of fashion, but a good rick roll? It's a classic.  
I even convinced myself for the first few nevers that it had sped up a little bit. 
Same. If it makes you feel any better about yourself, I actually thought I could hear it speed up a *little* at one point. 
i have it 2 never's just to make sure I wasnt tone deaf 
Not necessarily, if someone were to download the video in order to edit it to make it speed up, the watermark would still be there  
I was in denial until finishing the video and coming to the comments.  
"Crocodiles are easy. They try to kill and eat you. People are harder. Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first."  -Steve Irwin 
Every time a video shows up on reddit (with either kid) there are always snide comments mentioning how fake they seem, and how they're under pressure to be happy, etc. Almost like, *I don't believe someone can be that happy after their father was taken from them unjustifiably.*  Well, let's not forget that they were extremely young when their father passed. But what's really sad to me, is that so many people can't even believe that you can be as happy as the happy-blood that runs in their family. It's rare, sure. But I find it to be genuine, and intoxicating.   I also go to the dog park, and don't own a dog, so there is that. 
I feel like once the world lost Steve everything started to go down hill.   Of couse statistically crime and overall human suffering has also gone down in general. But the worlds a little less fun without the crocodile hunter out there.  
I don't really follow main stream celebrity going-ons, but when Steve died I was absolutely *devestated*. Such a passionate animal lover. 
My parents intentionally hid it from me because they knew I'd be devastated. I wrote him letters every week and he sent me a signed shirt for my birthday that I have cherished ever since.  
I wonder if Steve Irwin used "cunt"as often as the average aussie seems to in his off camera life...  
Even though it's a shame to have missed that opportunity, it sounds like you made the right decision. 
I grew up down the road from Australia Zoo and had the pleasure of meeting both Steve and Terry a couple of times Steve was exactly as the same as his television persona just a lovely bloke used to buy flowers from my mother every now and then. Terry was generally lovely however she did have a go at me one day due to my supermarket selling Kangaroo meat. Its good to see the family and the Zoo are still dedicated to fighting for conservation after his passing. 
The two for me were Steve Irwin and Robin Williams. Grew up watching those two constantly in TV shows and movies as a kid.  
One you see later and the other you see after awhile 
A Steve Irwin, Paul Hogan ticket would get my vote. They, along with Mad Max and Outback Steakhouse are all I know about Australia though.  
Yeah, it reminds me how I have achieved nothing in 11 years. 
I was thinking the exact same thing! I think it's because Kurt died so young that I never thought of his actual age. 
Unfortunately, the Discovery channel has gotten pretty shitty. 
He was a major world presense with animal conservation of all types. He traveled around the world showing amazing animals. He had several shows. His specialty was reptiles. His goal was to make it known that all animals are important and not really scary. He was very hands on but made it clear that an animal wont harm you if you give them the space they need. He is an inspiration and hero to millions. Many that are in my age group (27 here) really looked up to him and still grieve to a certain extent. Thats how much that man touched lives. 
I almost got choked up watching his son. Really made my heart smile seeing him! 
It's the BBC's graphic. The Brit's won't forget you! (Nor will you forget them, I guess) 
I would watch a station that used this graphic lol 
Same I was on my phone trying to get to another sub and saw this right as I clicked. Heart skipped a beat and thought Trump did something really big and bad and now I'm here...  
"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen." 
Or Trump again, but it is 2am where he is so not much happening in Trump land! 
''Aliens come to invade the Earth and instill a new world order''  ''Oh, thank God. I thought Trump launched a nuke'' 
Yeah I feel the same.  I don't know what it is, media saturation or something, but the world feels ... intense. 
Nah, it will just be the reverse of all previous AFD's, and will likely contain headlines like "TRUMP RESIGNS", "TRUMP HOSPITALIZED AFTER CORONARY", or "IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS BEGIN AT 10:00 AM", in other words stuff that everyone would want to hear and would latch onto in about 18 or 19 nanoseconds. 
I popped over to this universe to let you know that our top headline is "Bill has decided on a name for the new White House cat" 
Let's think positive thoughts, like... How's that moon base coming? Hope the Martian weather is nice.... 
It's the bed of needles theory all over again. This anti-immigration decree has already made people forget Trumps decrees about the wall, or the pipeline, or the anti-abortion gag-order.  Tonight he'll insult some celebrity over Twitter or something and everyone will focus on that next. 
Ooh, let me try:   "It's really the stupid pretentious left who spend their time unemployed, protesting and giving marginal real benefit to society that will probably be replaced in a few years with a robot or a shell script."  Or another way "Everyone who doesn't agree with me is an idiot.  I've checked, idiots believe different things from me.  Low smart people cover the country and vote for the other Lizard politician.    But not smart people like me, and I know this as other people who believe the same as me tell me I'm smart" 
That is some seriously high-proof snark right there. Jesus. 
I wish I could sob airports. Would get me out a debt at a much faster pace. In like...  20 years. 
can we just put that into every offical report and biography, wikipedia etc.? i mean, how much of an effort can it be? 
Well, that's just being stubborn.  I'm not surprised. 
"Oh god, it's a long line bra. Get the jaws of life!" 
I want to watch Rouge One but no one wants to watch it with me  
Instructions unclear:  am now dead by bra in moonlight. 
Meanwhile every ship in that universe clearly has artificial gravity and pressurized interiors. At no point are they weightless.  
There may have been a little snark involved when she wrote that, but I'm guessing she'd be pleased nonetheless if that was how it was reported.    
Copiously covered by or surrounded in. Like you would drown a pancake in maple syrup.  Since in the imagery she's invoking, she's in space, drowned in moonlight gives a beautiful, otherworldly image of floating serenely in space bathed in moonlight that contrasts with the mundane absurdity of being strangled by one's own bra. 
The people we grew up loving are all starting to die. 2017 will bring more of the same. :( 
In west Zimbabwe, bored and crazed  On Victoria Falls Bridge I spent one of my days  Chillin' out maxin', and drinkin' like a fool  I thought maybe bungee jumpin' might be kinda cool 
I think this would actually work, you would just need to change it up a bit. Trust-fund baby shouldn't be evading anything, he should be sent there by his parent, Carlton, who's wife left him or passed away. He is sent there because he is treating everything like it's nothing more than his right. While Will is living in West Philly, he has made something of himself but is still the free spirit that he was when he first went to Bel Air, and sees his nephew more uptight than Carlton when he moved out there, but also shallow and believing that he deserves anything and everything, just because he considers himself above everyone else. Will tries to introduce him to the real world, and show him that not everyone is handed everything and that they have to work hard and earn it.  Holy fuck, I NEED THIS SHOW NOW! SOMEONE GET A HOLD OF WILL SMITH!  
And played War Machine in the first season of the Iron Man cartoon 
Hillaryyyy bankssss  YES TREVOR  will  You  Marry  Meeeeeeeeeeeee  Splat 
And they'll be Latinos. Sitcoms with Latino families are the big thing on Netflix nowadays. The "One Day at a Time" reboot and "Cristella" are excellent! 
The stand off between him and a really big squirrel about 4 years ago...he never really fully recovered... 
I was like "my dogs a can?" Yeah I sent them an email with a link to the post. Thought they'd get an chuckle out of it  
Didn't think I'd like them, til I got to know a previous girlfriends chihuahua...  Best dog ever. Didn't bark, easy to take care of, and just wanted to sit in your lap every time you sat down. Big personality and kinda quirky.  Definitely want one myself - Similar to you, I'm a 6'6" guy living in the South.. if I do get one I'm sure I'd get heck from all the friends I grew up with, but eh... 
He's a tri color (dark brown, tan and white) Chihuahua named Zombie  
"Are those DECORATIVE rotors? What a weird species."  
It is frame rate. Shutter speed basically controls motion blur. 
Put it on the flat earth society and watch them lose their fucking minds.  
It just has to sync up with the rotation. Not necessarily that each photo is taken with 1 full rotation but it can be a number of rotations. I highly doubt the camera is capturing that quickly, but if you can sync it up close enough with a multiple of the period it takes for a full rotation you can get this effect.  Any photographers want to chime in with the technical explanation? 
I'm trying to teach myself not to be bothered by stuff like that, but it often does. 
Now *you* know that,  and *I* know that.  And lots of others commenting here do too.  But apparently the OP doesn't ! 
not a pro but I think the description explains it quite well.  the frame rate of the camera is in sync with the spin of the rotors.  basically every time it captures a frame, the rotors are in the same place so when you play the film, they appear to be stationary.  Have you ever seen film of a wagon or another wheel with prominent spokes & at some point the wheels appear to spin backwards?  Similar concept, the camera is capturing the spoke pointing up at 12:00, then it rotates clockwise all the way to 11:58 when it another frame is snapped, then again at 11:56, 11:54 etc.  when played at regular speed, the wheel appears to be rotating backwards. 
A lot of movies are going to be hard to watch now.  
Once ran into him in San Anselmo after school with my mom and he bough us milkshakes at Bubba's and stayed to talk with us for almost a half hour. Such a great person, really brightened my life 
Same here. My whole body dropped when I read the headline. 
That scene at the end of Good Will Hunting always gets me. I can't believe he's gone, really loved his acting and comedy. RIP. 
It hurts to think of such a hilarious guy being depressed enough to kill himself. 
Listen to his Marc Maron interview on Maron's podcast.  Was from 2010, but Maron just rebroadcasted it today.  Robin talks about drugs, depression, suicide, joke stealing allegations, etc.  Was by far the most in depth he's gotten about his depression publicly.  Just google Maron podcast...should come up top. 
Me too. He was a huge part of mine and many peoples childhoods. It's almost like losing a grandfather. 
Nah man... if he was hurting that bad... we just let him rest now. 
Dead poets society. Oh man, that one just hit me pretty hard. 
My heart sank when I first heard this. I've never felt so heartbroken over a celebrity passing.   
The tragedy (imo) is that someone so beloved that brought so much joy and laughter to the world was so tormented by his demons and suffered so much for so long. His personal life was rife with mental illness, addiction, and tragedy. While his professional life made such a huge impact on so many of us, it's heartbreaking to know that he never found the same joy he so freely gave to others.  
UK:  08457 90 90 90  No matter how hard it ever gets, there will always be someone willing to listen, to advise and to help you. We are human beings, it's what we do. 'All for one, and one for all' 
Suicide. I feel horrible. I don't think a celebrity death has ever bothered me like this. 
Acknowledging people's different colors, shapes, and sizes isn't a bad thing. We're all wonderfully and terrifically different from each other. That can be something to celebrate!  The problem is when we begin to harbor prejudices about certain differences. 
Reminds me of when a friend and i switched names for a substitute teacher in high school.   I said "why?"   He said "Shenanigans will ensue".  I figure I'll roll with it, when she calls my name he answers and vice versa.  Then i hear "Ok glennis, you were late so I'm gonna have to write it in for the teacher to hear"  My god I've never been played so badly in my life. 
My parents were trying to figure out which kid my brother was talking about in his kindergarden class. When they finally narrowed it down to the only black kid in class, they asked him, "Is she black?" My brother said, "No, she's kinda brown."  
Seriously. Kid on the left has slightly bigger ears but other features are very close.  
I'm sure there's some hidden message about racial acceptance in there  
Oh they care about race. Put them in a 40 yard dash and they will try like heck to win!  
Fuck you got me I didn't expect it because you're not /u/shittymorph 
It's actually a form of forced relocation. Since most Steelers fans are uncivilized savages , we mandate that their youth attend special schools to be properly civilized. After a few years of education, the newly assimilated youths will be returned to their ancestral hovels - although most of their nation's territory is in Pennsylvania, there are some outskirt reservations in various other states.   
Am I allowed to say that would be fabulous? No? Go to my room? Fine... 
Of all shows, White Collar did an excellent job of showing this. One f the side characters was lesbian, and she had a life partner. They had the "if it was legal" discussion. Then it became legal in the show.   Then they broke up.   It was a fascinating dynamic, actually. And that season was a several years ago.  
You played the long con and lost.   Safe travels comrade, and may your password be for ever secure. 
Man, I live in San Francisco so I get no drama at all. Just happiness and celebration. What a bummer.  
this would be me. lol  I'd go down to the courthouse tomorrow, but he has dreams of a huge wedding on the beach with like 1000 guests and a weekend-long extravaganza and like, I don't want to pay for that shit. it's an absurd expense. 
I would love to see this awkward press conference now 
Free happiness? Good, now I can settle more cities!      Shout out to /r/civ 
And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle, so that Man could fight the dinosaurs. And the homosexuals. 
I've never been more grateful about living 600 miles away from my nearest relatives. 
Don't forget any benefits you get from work may apply to your spouse now! Go talk to HR, you have the supreme court backing you . 
I'm not sure why you have Fallout 4 as second place. Time to bring out my pitchfork.  ------E 
We are not done. In many states it is legal to fire someone based on their sexuality. The fight for gay rights did not begin with the debate over same sex marriage and it will not end with same sex marriage either. 
Fellow straight man here. It's just nice to have more options ya know? 
As a heterosexual male, it does affect me. That the homosexual people my life are able to find such happiness means a lot. 
It's Pride week pretty much everywhere, right? Because of the Stonewall Riots June 28 1969. 
Technically, but functionally it's the same thing, right? In fact, you could say they legalized it by banning the banning of it.  
This is actually good for the GOP, in a sense, because they no longer have the gay marriage issue hanging over their heads. The SCOTUS took care of that. So one of their contentious issues is no longer a problem.  
Jeez fine. Picky picky. I'll go hop in my same-sex Jeep, head over to lesbian breakfast and celebrate my "marriage".  
Tough week for conservatives, great week for the GOP political establishment. 
OP was the first to post the ACA decision, too. Big karma week for him/her. 
Didn't someone say they'd set themselves on fire if this happened?  I'm waiting. 
And Scalia can't get any Saltier.  Seeing him squirm is satisfying. 
Utah has had legalized gay marriage for some time(their circuit court ruled in favor of gay marriage and the supreme court denied appeal) 
My parents just got divorced and stopped talking to me. Worked out for the best in the end I suppose 
Is that when he quit his job and went on to cook meth?  
By these criteria, I'm a dad, and I'm a 23-year-old with no kids. 
I'd still consider you an artist, just more of a face painter. 
I think OP mentioned it was a motorized easel but now all I see is medieval neck snapper 
Seriously, I've been looking for something to replace what's already in my room, but I've been having such a hard time choosing something that I would actually want. This is it, for sure. 
My dad too. He laid new tile in his bathroom and has yet to glue it down or use grout. It's just sitting on the floor like a giant puzzle. It's been 3 months 
That's his motorized easel he built! That small controller by his foot allows the whole painting to move up and down. Sounds like a fucking banshee when he uses it--there were a lot of nights where I couldn't sleep cause he'd be up painting and using that thing. 
I think Seth and I both really want to keep it going 
I misread the first part as Hillary for Charity which sounds like a Hillary Clinton circlejerk gala 
He's like that friend that only texts you once per year to wish you happy birthday, except with a picture of Seth Rogan and he just wishes himself happy birthday. 
I could hear a shorter version echo of this as I looked at each picture - something like:  Ah-huh ^Ah-huh ^^Ah-huh ^^^Ah-huh  
Seth and his wife Lauren started Hilarity for Charity in 2012, HFC spreads awareness and raises money to benefit the alzheimers association. Ive had the opportunity to meet Seth at HFC events and take these pictures over the past four years.  
uh huh huh huh ^uh ^huh ^huh ^huh ^^uh ^^huh ^^huh ^^huh ^^^uh ^^^huh ^^^huh ^^^huh ^^^^uh ^^^^huh ^^^^huh ^^^^huh 
They honestly both look like cardboard cutouts to me. Its weird. 
I think they just meet at an annual charity event that Rogen started. 
OH WHAT, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME I CANT PLAY WITH FIRE WORKS IN A DENSE FORREST?   PFFT 
Honestly, I bet it would help to establish that it was parody and thus fair use.  
How can you prevent forest fires all the way from the arctic circle!?  You interpreted this all wrong!    Only you can prevent the fires!  Not by avoiding forests, but by protecting them with your unawakened ability.  Your great great great great grandfather was a mighty Native American Chief whose name translated to "Smokes with Bears".  He was able to telepathically communicate with all Bears within a 10,000-mile radius.    The Bears were only used for putting out fires that were caused by Lightning, uncontrolled bonfires, and tribal wars.  The keepers of the forrest, 'Smokes with Bears' would use his shaman powers to imbue them with anti-flammable polyester coats so that they would use their bodies to smother all flames.  This is your calling.  Now go smoke with some bears.   
Here's a fun fact. It's actually "Smokey Bear" with no "the" in between. Weird, huh? 
Oh my god! Someone giving credit for their jokes...on Reddit? 
Thats it, ya cant have forest fires if there's no trees. 
That's why they have prescribed burns... putting out your campfire and not tossing cigarette butts should be common sense...but since it's not so common they have to run a campaign with a cartoon character to get people's attention. 
Why don't you donate to a related organization instead? 
Came here to say this.  Lamentably, this comment is way down the page. 
DON'T BRING LOGIC HERE!!  BUT MUH FEELINGSSSSS!!1111 
Not the USFS as a whole, but the Wildland Firefighting portion of the FS has been going up. The USFS as an agency has actually been losing funding under the recent administration. 
You couldn't be more clueless huh? It doesn't have to by a major Forrest.  I was just in KC and they have large sections of trees.  Woods, brush fires etc are what the service has always wanted people to be wary of.   
Fire is actually a very beneficial occurrence for forests in California. The fire suppression management programs used in the 1900s and currently are very counterproductive if the goal is to keep the forests in the natural ecological state they were before human colonization. By preventing every fire you actually allow the build up of more plant fuel (usually burns out in small fires), which leads to more large scale, more intense, and more severe fires. Fires also allow the natural succession process to occur. Not to say infrastructure and homes should not be protected, but fire is a necessity for a healthy forest in California. 
I still think it's important to prevent forest fires by those unskilled to handle it. We started to do controlled burns which allow for new growth and preventing big forest fires.  
Hm yes. The middle east wars are *all* liberals fault.  
I have some good news for you: they haven't been defunded.   I have some bad news for you: only dumb people get their political news from funny tshirts.... 
I can remember the summer where pushing people into the pool died. 
He is just testing a new transition technique; this one is much faster than dismounting and dipping your toes to see how chilly the water is. 
I would argue his only mistake was not letting the umbrella go sooner to have more control of the bike.  But then again, we wouldn't have this wonder gif to laugh at. 
Honestly after watching a few times I don't think he even saw it and the board knocked him of his bike unexpectedly.  
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Umbrella the Damp? 
It's the skateboard "fall" that starts the stink of BS.  
I think that's exactly what we are seeing. Judging by his momentum when he comes into frame, I think he was simply trying to make the turn and didn't see the board in time to avoid it. 
Can't believe it took that long for someone to comment this, what kind of madman skateboards in that kind of weather? 
Mr. /u/SpeakLikeAChild04, are you in bed with russia? The people needs to know. 
Vodka was once banned in Russia, it made tax uncertain and death much more certain  
Try a gin and tonic wiht lime. Moscow mule is a sign of russian hacking the alcohol supply of USA.  
It's likely in a predominantly liberal city, like New York or San Francisco. 
I don't drink smirnoff any more, but I also don't drink it any less either 
Ah yes, surely they'll suffer the unspeakable devastation Target and Starbucks endured. 
Trump says a lot of things. At this point I can only believe what he actually does, nothing he says is reliable on any level. 
I couldn't find a news article on google. Maybe someone with stronger Google-Fu.  
I mean it's vodka. It's not swill* but like any vodka it should be used as an ingredient and not consumed as a drink in itself. That's reserved for sorority girls and eastern Europeans suffering from depression.  *super cheap vodka can have a bit of a funky taste, but above a certain quality threshold it's all about the same. 
I mean... they normally use photoshop or so to touch up the pictures in the ad. :P 
Why does he have to be bald?? Smh scalpal profiling 
1. Cross-post to /r/HailCorporate and /r/AdPorn. 2. Swim in karma. 
The tag is assigned by AutoModerator based on whether or not certain words appear in the title. None of those words appear in this title, so you'll have to wait until a mod notices this post and flairs it themselves. 
Honestly, The front page is a shit show and every sub is finding a way to squeeze in Trump disdain. It would be nice if the mods showed some consistency in what is allowed. 
Very cool owner who buys her the bus pass and enables her to leave on her own!  
She has secretly started a relationship with a local city alderman, who happens to be married, and she spends most of the day down at the rec-centre, which doubles as campaign headquarters, where she cold calls registered voters and directs any packages that may be delivered.   
I'm 22 years in and can't even make it to the dog park by myself.  
I'm having a true blue shit day and I just had the best laugh at this. Many thanks. 
I always feel bad for owners that are stuck at home alone all day while their pets are at the park. 
To be fair, I don't think the dog can do her own laundry either.  That's ok though, dogs don't wear clothes. 
Yea and if you can't handle her bite then you don't deserve her best.  
Everyone knows her and they even did an article on her in the local newspaper.  
Technical there's only one toy in one unless there's a cactus in that cactus that was in the original cactus. 
It's a metaphor. The outside is how I act but peel back the layer to reveal my true self. Me irl  
Barkbox is so legit. My pup had a similar discovery with a dragon toy of theirs from last year where he'd just been destroying it, and then a squeaky ball came out of the head. He looked at me in disbelief and jumped around the ball for a few minutes out of sheer joy 
Yeah bark box does this stuff!! My dog has a toy where it has a ball inside. I think they call them like tuff toys or something of the sort for the purpose of dogs who rips stuff up! I love their stuff! 
Oh yeah, forgot about the flower. She ripped that part off immediately 
You're not alone... getting bombarded by PMs from people accusing me of being a shill.  Rest assured it's just me and one crazy 8 month old golden retriever. 
After reading this and reading the OP I can confidently say I had a momentary freak out over how weird the word "one" looked.  
Thank you I was really hoping I wasnt alone in feeling like I don't recognize the word 'one'. 
And follow up with an Xbox 6s, then an Xbox 6s Plus. 
Yo dawg I heard u like Xbox, SO WE PUT YOUR XBOX ONE X IN AN XBOX ONE X BOX 
How many Lowe's could a Rob Lowe rob if a Rob Lowe could rob Lowe's?   
Or when he explained Super Saiyan to Majin Buu.   "And this is to go EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!" 
They were convinced everyone was going to call it "The One" because they were totally full of themselves.    People will still call it the xbone, or the catching xXxbonexXx 
wait till samsung starts making gaming consoles directly 
Omg!!!! Me too!!! Truthfully. Did you just smoke a bowl? 
That was never its real name it was a code name, just like [Nintendo Nx] for the Nintendo switch, even though Nx sounds cooler 
You know Microsoft. The next console is gonna be called Project Pluto, and then when it comes out, it's gonna be the Xbox Two. 
I assume you're joking, but actually it's true. Which is why Dad should not let Baby do that.  
Difference is the victim in this situation is actually going to fuck his mom. 
That diaper is empty; the line hasn't changed color, and it still has wrinkles that it wouldn't have if it was wet or poopy.  *Source:*  I change diapers. 
Can someone please sync Jim Ross/Jerry Lawler's commentary about Rikishi's finishing move with this gif?    
You can only love them for so long.  Can't believe you lasted this long tbh. 
"And I fuck your mom. Whenever you shut up long enough that is"   *face sitting intensifies*  
Yellow line on the diaper. This gif is a victory if you ask me.  
I thought I was the only one getting butt smashed in the face! 
I showed my wife this gif, and she asked me when I took that video.  We have 2 about that age, and two just a bit older, and she thought it was me.  Maybe I'm your husband's twin brother. 
Kids naturally twerk.  It's like the most basic dance move 
God I love being gay  I'm not getting anyone pregnant! 
I'm also in my early 20s and have a 6 month old. I've gotten baby shit on my fingers and a tiny bit on my face less than an hour ago, by the way. Unless you are an extremely calm and patient person after several months of sleep deprivation, I suggest against it.  
Winston Churchill, while talking about the plight of the British forces in Malakand (1897) he had this to say, "The profession of medicine, and surgery, must always rank as the most noble that men can adopt." 
Weird how we don't hear much about the Manchester incident though? Few weeks later and it feels like it went out of the mediasphere?  
I saw somewhere that there was an initial 2 minute response time for first responders, is this accurate? Pretty amazing if so  
Yes, major credit to the first responders and thank you for all that you do. 
Not to mention PTSD. A client of mine at the charity I work for was stabbed in the shoulder by his brother ten years ago and even bringing it up now makes him get very emotional and overwhelmed. Sometimes the after effects are invisible to the eye but just as impactful. 
It's a misleading title. There were eight deaths as a result. I'm not sure if that makes 56 victims or if the deaths include the attackers making for 53 victims. 
I will never understand why people wouldn't want national health care...  
This needs more credit, the emergency wards that dealt with them and the paramedics are used to serious knife injuries.... We don't as a rule see gunshot wounds, stabbings and glassings are probably weekly for many casualty departments and paramedics in the major cities... 
Cutting policing budgets and legalising fox hunting.. 
Seems fine to be honest. He was being quoted from his hospital bed in a newspaper i read yesterday. Seem's like he's making a full recovery too. 
Pfff. Anyone with any small amount of ingenuity can have that entire haul with little effort. 
No, no, no, it's healthy because there is an apple in their logo... duh! 
Speaking of mimics, we have these treasure chests right? And we have monsters who have evolved to look just like chests Why the fuck do we still make treasure chests that look like them?

There's actually a door on these machines you're meant to stick your hand into to grab the snack can't tell for sure if it's on this one though  
'This is my purpose?  Nope. Nope. Nope.  Take them all, and leave me be.  I need some alone time.' 
No, no, no you have it all wrong. You find the vending machine guy and tell him you are interested in working for the company. The best way to get secrets is from the inside right? So you get a job and little by little you collect money from this company. Eventually you realize you have enough saved up to buy tons of chips, buy a car, support a family, live a good life, etc 
If you break the glass, you can get free chips even if this doesn't happen.

You can always fight back by making your own sign! You'll save money (probably), keep them off your lawn, AND flip them off with your own sign.  
I thought you were going to say he held up his drill and drilled a hole in their door. Instant peephole! 
What do you use the sign to prevent? Salesmen, or JW's 
Honestly, kids don't understand most of those signs. When I was young I used to think prosecuted meant executed so I took those "violaters will be prosecuted" signs very seriously.  
But he can't knock on their door to sell anything. Short-sighted thinking for a quick buck. 
Yep, waking my sleeping babe is the fastest way to get me to NOT buy anything from you *EVER*. 
It almost certainly *did* come from a craft shop. You can't make something like that at home for under $5. 
Why would he care about future competition when he can't go there anymore either? 
Hi sir, I see you have the 2017 "No Soliciting" sign, have you heard of the new 2018 "no soliciting" sign, with weather stripping and rubber grommets that won't rub on your door? 
I go with the generic "except for kids". Ya some other kids may have chocolate...or pies; we got pies one time and they were good. 
Easiest pitch ever.    "Hi there, I noticed that you don't have a no soliciting sign posted on your property. For the low low price of only $5, you can prevent jerks like me from ever knocking at your door again"! 
I'm sorry, when we moved into our place now we would have about 2 stops a day by solicitors. Bought a sign and have pretty much had peace since.  
I specifically don't buy from them and usually yell at them to help prepare them for the real world. 
One of those pest control guys came by to my house not too long ago in the middle of the night and I told him "Dude it's 8:54, who's stupid enough to bother people in this time of day. Get off my property". And he left staring at the house with a look of what I can only call disgust. 
Lol this is my exact thought process, drives my wife batshit when she comes home from work at 1130pm and I'm asleep with the TV on. Used to be a DVD menu screen looping over and over, now it's a "continue watching" button being slowly burned into the screen.  Best is when she turns it off and I immediately wake up and tell her I was watching it.  Ive become so accustomed to falling asleep with the TV on that I can't sleep without it anymore. I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing but it is what it is lol. 
In all seriousness this post made me happy to know I'm not alone when it comes to irrational Sunday anxiety that sets in when I still have 30% of my weekend left.  The dumbest part is that around noon Monday I remember for the billionth time that while weekdays aren't as much fun as weekends, my life is fucking fine. 
"Hi, hello? Hi, yes. I'm sad to report that I won't be able to come in tomorrow. Why? Oh, yes. Uh. I'm dead. I've died. Very sad. I should be better by Tuesday, yes. Ok. Thank you. I will, bye." 
I had that thought too! We can work out some possibilities though based on the Netflix line and the fact that it says "night" in the title. If each show is 22 minutes, and night starts at what, 5:00, 6:00... Yeah I'm gonna need a little help here. Return to your increasing panic! 
Right before bedtime when you set your alarm and realize it will be going off in four hours, after you tell yourself all weekend that THIS will be the week you start with a good night's sleep. :( 
1 "panic"- gradual curve up from the origin   2 "likelihood of going on that run"- small downward curve   3 "Netflix shows watched"- staircase   4 "sex had"- line running along the bottom   5 "will to live"- big downward curve 
Where the hell are there 36 kids in a class, so I know never to go there? 
Same! I stopped watching TV to get ready for bed, yet here I am. 
But his panic curve is exponential meaning it will continue approaching infinity. Yours being constant means you are okay at managing it. 
Plus I'm not even sure the Netflix line is a function.  
You're brave and strong and smart, and will get through it. And then it will be over!  
This is usually how it ends up - which is a mistake on Monday.... 
Sunday mornings are nice. It's all downhill after 12pm though. 
Find a job you actually want to go to or that will probably be there forever.  
Because it is shows watched, so a show has to complete them the number boosts up, so that line couldnt be gradually declining but rather every 20 mins or 40 mins it bumps up to another level of # of shows watched  
I get a similar reaction when I approach women at the bar. 
I'm an 18 year old man only interested in people who are interested in men ages 25-40.  Finally a dating site that suits my needs /s 
Im 31 so 22 is ok for me to date? Hooray for college girls with low self esteem 
More like the site taking a screenshot and sending it to the FBI. 
Say what you want about pedophiles, but at least they drive slowly in school zones. 
Well that's just not fair. Everyone knows you go to adult friend finder for that.

I spent an afternoon with Adam West in about '95 shooting a celebrity test drive article for bikini magazine. We shot it up by the old batcave entrance in Griffith Park. The coolest thing was his voice. It just drips coolness. 
Another good cameo is the Brave and the Bold episode Chill of the Night! where he plays Thomas Wayne.   (Also features Kevin Conroy as the Phantom Stranger in a wager with Mark Hamill as the Spectre)  
Was too young to enjoy his older work but I loved him in family Guy. RIP mayor West :( 
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb -  Adam West 
Adam West was the batman we deserved, just not the one we needed 
Seems like he knew how to make and take a joke on himself. Was always a joy on the show. RIP :( 
A Batman? West actually believed he was *the* Batman. 
Where did you hide that he didn't know you were there week after week?  
You do realize the show is an intentional comedy right?  
I will never forget his role as Catman in Fairly odd parents. That was the first role I saw him in. 
Growing up in the 1990's, I was (and still am) a huge Batman fan. One weekend FX had a marathon of the old Batman series and my uncle taped about a dozen episodes for me. I watched them so much my mom plotted to destroy the tape just so she didn't have to hear the nananana Batman! theme again. I just adored his version of Batman and how he got out of all those menacing traps. Truly a cherished childhood memory. Thanks Mr. West.  
Ralph Garman already took care of that a year or two ago. 
I like the zoom in at the beginning. Quality camera work. 
I think it's hilarious that human babies are the opposite, and just think they have it under control but if we let them they would injure themselves horrible attempting the stairs. 
Agreed. That lookaround: "Did anyone else see that?" 
I think I somehow heard that dogs mind explode during that gif. 
In my internal reading of this, Doggo was voiced by Sam Elliott.  
You must extract the file first, but you used up your free trial of WinZip :( 
You're going to get downvoted but ill stand by you while it happens. "Doggo" is super cringeworthy.  
Lower the tripod like 1cm and it wouldn't tilt me by having the leaf touch the peak.   Amazing photo, but that choice.. 
 Beautiful Fugi.  Will be my new screen saver.  Thanks a lot op. 
you know I almost didn't click the comments for this, because I wasn't sure if the reference would reach out that far.  I was mistaken. 
felt the same.... birds and canopy of trees is either REALLY far away, or the lower half is shopped in reflection 
Hey now, stop that you    That's not how you make Haiku    It's snowing on Mount Fuji. 
I was trying to figure out what was so off-putting about a photo that seemed fine enough. 
Man, it's one thing to be interested in cultures with rich histories.  It's another altogether to wear cat ears and learn a dozen Japanese words to pepper into your English. 
It's not the tree itself but the ratio. There is too much tree. The tree and the reflection form a natural vignette but its off center and the mountain is not framed correctly.  Humans enjoy mathematical patterns. This is where the rule of thirds comes from and while the rule of thirds may be overly simplistic the reason it works is the same reason most rules of composition work and that's because a balance of symmetry and focus are vital to a good picture.  All the photographer needed to do was take this from about a foot lower. The mountain would have been framed and the tree would take up the right percentage of the image. The leading lines of the mountain would not be broken and the intense orange of the leaves would not distract from the dull whites of the mountain top which should be the focus in the this image not the tree.

"I wish to stop hallucinating genies."  "Wish granted. Looks like I'm real after all. There goes your last wish!" 
Alternatively,  "Hey, maybe I should revise for exams!"  "Or I could binge a netflix show..."  "Nah I should probably revise. 
Reminds me of the saying a good carpenter never blames his tools. 
Hey thank you so much!! I have heard wonderful things about your city 
Instead of second guessing his wish after being confronted by the genie about it, he defends his wish, so the wish was granted. Hence the understanding in the 4th frame. 
The man wants to be more sure of his decisions, genie asks if he wants to waste his wish on this, the man says yes this is what he wants, this implies that he never needed a wish at all, it was inside him all along.  
The genie tried to question the quality of the guy's wish. Instead of second guessing himself, the guy starts to defend his wish, and then realizes that the genie had already granted it.

Yeah they'll probably switch the title around, *Skyrim: The Elder Scrolls*  And the next TES will be *Skyrim VI*

You can probably already stream Skyrim from your PC onto a smartwatch, since you can stream it with a phone. Skyrim running on the watch itself is probably less than a decade away (Assuming that smartwatches don't die out). 
so we'll have people on Mars by the time it comes out? 
In fairness, Capcom also made three new main series Resident Evil games (their quality notwithstanding) since then, plus a couple RE spin-offs and dozens of non-RE games.  Has Bethesda developed anything substantial since Skyrim aside from Fallout 4? (I would say Dishonored, but I'm almost certain they only published that.) 
I mean, the graphics of Fallout 4 weren't anything groundbreaking like Skyrim was. (which I'm okay with) They just focused on widening the audience way too much, unfortunately. A disturbing trend in new Bethesda games. 
the argument goes that ESO counts as an installment in 2014.

As the fame of op grows over time, the pressure on him equally heightens. Until one day op is consumed by the anguish that he will never make an original piece as great as his first. Defeated by his inner demons, he browses the top posts of the year on funny and submits them again... Hoping to feel how he felt the first time.

The article says that this deal was actually approved during Obama's administration by both the Congress and the Executive Branch.  I can't stand Trump but it doesn't even look like this was his decision. I wonder what it takes to even pull out of it. 
They know most people only read the headlines. They take advantage of it. There's no standards in media anymore.. 
Well to be honest every single Muslim country is considered a liberal when compared to the Saudi Arabia. 
Yes, it was authorized by both branches last November, but the deal wasn't actually agreed upon or formalized with Qatar until 2 months ago. So, yes. He's still contradicting himself. 
Many Trump supporters voted for him thinking he would deal with Arab countries differently, and stop tolerating their bullshit. He now seems to be tolerating all of them as long as they cut checks.   Keep in mind most of the people that voted for him are not redditors who subscribe to /r/The_Donald.  Maybe his already tenuous support base will begin to erode with continuous news like this 
Yes, both in neighboring countries and Northern Africa. Then again, every other country in the region plus even the US funds terrorists. National interests seem to trump regional stability. 
The difference is that Obama didn't go on record on Twitter blatantly criticizing the Qatari government for 'funding terror' days before finalizing the sale.  Secondly, Trump has full authority to cancel the deal if he wants to. The fact that he didn't is hypocritical especially considering he got elected on an agenda of doing everything possible to stop fundamentalism. So yes, criticize Obama all you like for doing this, but Trump deserves his fair share as well, since he's the one in power right now.  I agree - context matters. 
Yeah, and we used drug money to fund a lot of it.  The good ole days. 
Trump could have backed out of the deal like he has done with others. 
she was running away from him and he launched himself to catch her. too funny! 
A classmate's dog did something similar to me when I was 6 (same size dog as in the video), knocked me straight on my ass and started licking my face. My friend's mother, who was walking the dog, was terrified I was hurt, but I just laughed it off and played with the dog. Dogs are awesome.  
You are not alone. It's new to me.  And I just kept laughing and thinking "Mooove, bitch! Get out the way!" 
Imagine how scary wolves were 10000 years ago. No wonder we hid in caves.  
I'm curious too. That looks like a new Mexico lobos football sweater from about 2002-2003 that the players received. 
First guess is that this was cute when the dog was a small puppy, and it never unlearned the behavior. 
But that's the thing.. wood floors tell a story... 
Hope your week gets better! I proper lol'd on that one. Definitely gave me a happy

The internet is a wonderful place. You can stumble upon albino midgets shitting on each other more than once, but a dancer with a cat on the beach? Never. (Except now obviously) 
She has a harness and a leash but, she's not very fast and in this case preferred to stay in her carrier facing away from the water. Did not care where her tuna comes from. 
I have been scrolling for so long, I had almost lost hope that someone else would be reminded of this.  
I'm long past the point of shame.  This isn't even in the same galaxy as my most shameful fap.  This is the complimentary mint I take without even thinking before I move on to my main courses.  I won't even remember this fap. 
More like... "Dang, we're out of kitty litter. Wait, we're just 12 minutes from the beach!" 
Its India.   Their movies are "all emotions and genre at once" and their food is "all spices at once".     
Yeah I can't believe nobody else noticed this..look at the green of the trees. The color saturation is cranked WAY up. Every other photo of this kind of squirrel on google without color editing is just brown and red and a little yellow  
Visit any nearby sanctuary or forest area. Its common . 
It is heavily edited in Photoshop. The colors are not this strong IRL. Saturation is cranked up like crazy.  
One thing that I find weird is that how despite editing becoming ubiquitous in digital photography, there's what seems to be more resistance from photographers discussing that aspect of their trade than the rest (technical settings, framing etc).    It's weird, because, here's this tool that everyone uses to improve their photographs, but rarely mention it upfront or discuss which methods they used. 
And that one who always wants to talk to people just walking by. 
Depending on the time of the year you'll get halibut, striped bass, leopard sharks, bat rays, surf perch, smelt, etc. I don't think Salmon come that close when they're running. Dungeness crabs are legal from any beach or pier on the ocean, but not inside the Bay. 
Lucky he got there early. After 1 in the afternoon there's nothing but bare ass and shlongs. Bit of a bother when you're trying to hold a photoshoot. 
I recently moved to AZ from the SF Bay. I miss the bay sometimes, but AZ is so relaxing and there's so much to do. It's not too far either! 
The way you said that means the bridge is constantly losing beauty. 
I don't know, the Presidio and Lands End both have great views if the weather isn't too bad 
Fair enough...but titles like this attract people like you who can't help but comment on it. This drives up activity of the photo and pushes it to the front page easier.   Marketing.  
Omg he never said anything like that, your comment is so helpful.  Just shut up and enjoy the picture. 
He woke up at 5am. Didn't necessarily take the shot then. 
If you go screen left  there's something midfall so willing to bet it's not a person 
he seems to be answering the comments on his videos pretty quickly, maybe try asking him there? 
I saw 2 $500s since then,  those individuals are worth noting as well. 
He now has over $12,000, and over 3k subscribers!  
Where's the link? I'm on mobile and can't find it anywhere. 
It truly is amazing seeing all these people show support for this guy. This is a light in a seemingly dark world.  
Contact him on YouTube. He is responsive there! Up vote so it's seen.  
Agreed, I've never really given to a GoFundMe but after watching his video and my eyes started sweating, how could I not just throw in ten bucks?  
It's in the description of that Youtube Video.  Comments with a direct link don't appear due to Rule 5, which is why there are a lot of replies to this comment that can't actually be loaded. 
Hey I shot you a PM about Canine Companions for Independence, an organization that provides service dogs free of charge. I have raised service dogs for them in the past, and I know how life changing they can be. 
No man, thank YOU. Thanks for sharing your feelings. It means a lot to me. Life becomes a lot better when we connect like this together. 
Very curious to see where the dust will settle on this one.  I think things are going to be surprisingly easier for Kevin for awhile 
Now that he has passed the goal I can almost guarantee the impact is less about the dollar value and more about the true volume of people who are loving him.   They will spend the money but they will never forget all the strangers whom he will never meet that showed him what love and kindness is. 
Wait, does health insurance usually pay for someone's car?is that a normal thing in other countries? 
He's been slow playing it for 9 years and he's ready to strike!  
No the horse is thinking, if she keeps kicking me I am going to die 
My horse broke a(nother) halter yesterday because the hose was obviously about to eat him.  It's not like I've been giving him baths at least once a year for the past 13 years or anything. 
Thank you, thank you for making me aware of something I literally never thought about until now. Added to the checklist of shit not to do around horses. 
It's like she's not even trying. Like...just jump a little bit. Just swinging your leg over obviously isn't working so put a little more hop into it with your left leg. She looked like somebody throwing themselves at a hooked wall while wearing a velcro suit....except the wall isn't hooked and there is no suit.  
Some horses are very helpful though. I grew up with on my mom called "The sitter" because he was super gentle and helpful with kids and beginners. He'd use his neck to to nudge you on, and he would not trot or canter until you were actually ready.   I remember a friend riding him who was super unbalanced. He didn't trot for a solid 30 minutes until my friend got used to being on a horse. Then when he did start to run and my friend slipped to one side the horse would stop, spread his legs out and wiggle his back as needed to "catch" the rider.   I miss that horse, That was my mom's first baby. She had him longer than she's had me, and I'm 20 now.  
"Oh ffs Linda, can't you do anything on your own?" 
Just want to say that I grew up horseback riding and can confirm that fly mounting is incredibly difficult. 
What does having bare feet have to do with riding bareback and getting a pelvic crushed? 
"This thread is weirdly aggressive..."  "No shit"  And the cycle continues. 
i dunno wtf is wrong with her, im like 3x her weight and i can pull myself on one, she had zero spring to her jump and was just pivoting 
Yeah she was just pretending, it wasn't exactly needed though because with the cuts it's easy to tell the horse only lays down on command. Jumping on a horse really isn't that hard unless you're too small or overweight (and this girl clearly isn't) when it's standing completely still like that, even someone who has never been on a horse will instinctively use the horse mane to pull himself.  
They need the donations to afford all the paint needed for the black out. 
Just doing the same thing we've done in the past doesn't seem like very much fun, does it? :-) We're still working on the details -- and leaving lots of room for input from the Internet and for sites to get creative -- but the basic idea is that sites will display something really prominent that shows the different ways that losing net neutrality would break the Internet (ie slow loading, censorship, extra fees, etc.) SOPA was a blackout because it was about censorship -- net neutrality is broader, so we have more room to get creative. 
Google could end this shit in a day if they really wanted to. Can you imagine if Google search, gmail, youtube were all shut down for an entire day and just replaced by a paragraph on net neutrality?  They would never do that of course, but fuck if that wouldn't get literally everyone's attention. 
You really want Net Neutrality to get out there? ...... Have every one of these sites agree to shut down for just 3 hours, with a message about Net Nuetrality and links for next steps.     3 Hours without Social Media, Porn or Shopping will make worldwide news for weeks and shake up the country like never before.........as sad as that is.     Edit : Thank you for the Gold!! Edit 2 :  I love goooooooold.  (Thanks again!) 
Nope, StackOverflow and GitHub are shutting down too. 
Maybe not Vsause, we want to stay on a central topic not 20 different ones about tech and the internet in general. 
Comcast has captive customers, from long contracts and lack of broadband competition. When they get in a dispute with a content provider, and traffic is harmed or blocked altogether, it hurts both sides. But Comcast can hold out longer, because their customers largely aren't going anywhere. 
We're going to be announcing a lot more details soon. We wanted to make it an open process where we can get lots of feedback from Internet users, online communities, and websites that will be participating. See my comment above for some more examples of the types of stuff sites might do :-) 
I was just thinking how cool it would be if all of these sites could block Ashit Pie from using their services. I feel like that would be an awesome way to demonstrate why we need certain regulations for fairness in internet services.  
I think Netflixes statement is the saddest part about this. They basicly said "we want to fight this, but it would be futile and it won't hurt us as much anymore". The futile part is what gets me, since Netflix has been so strongly in favor of NN for years now. 
Hopefully your comment gains more visibility. I'm all for net neutrality. Why do you need my phone number and full name... definitely discourages people from signing up 
Oddly enough it could actually affect the internet outside of the us. Say for example a small American startup hosts their new video site themselves and have to serve through Comcast yet refuse to pay Comcast's extra fees for priority bandwidth. Well, if you try to use their site it's going to run slower because the source is being restricted. It's one example but a real one. 
Just remember - her and Leslie Knope are basically the same person. 
PornHub is probably one of the most progressive companies out there. This is par for the course for them. Remember, the company basically exists on the fringe of society by the mere nature of their business.   The "establishment" are who want NN to go away. 
In my country mobile providers already have Social Media Data Packs (Unlimited FB/Twitter/Instagram/YouTube etc. for cheap)  Now you know why. 
I'm all for this.   Having pornhub load slowly wouldn't work on me. They merely adopted the slow internet. I was born in it, molded by it.  
It's like they forgot that WordPress developers can only develop in plugins. ^/s  But in all seriousness, you don't need a plugin for this. Just throw up a little HTML banner that fades away on a click event. 
Are you going to shut down YOUR business for the day? 
No one is sure yet. There have been talks about a black out or a Internet slow down.  
It's invented by some german (Fabian Thylmann) dude who's now pretty much behind all the big porn sites.   (just google what belongs to "MindGeek") 
My friend has a chocolate lab and I swear it's the most energetic derp.  
My black lab goes berserk if you say "hey Daphne you want" and whatever comes after that is her favorite thing ever. I have a video somewhere of my friend saying that to her, and she just got on her hind legs and jumped on him so hard you could hear him go OOMPH.  
Or when I'm at the bar with 6 friends and waitress just brought our beers, but I'm not the first to get my glass. 
This is why we evolved two hands: double-wielding labrador patting! 
Worked as a gas station cashier for a stint after college, this is so true. I have a decent collection of silver coins because of these people. 
Coin shop.  If they have a moral objection,  try another coin shop.  If you have a moral objection, a jeweler or metallurgist can reclaim the silver. 
I've got a friend who's an expert nazi, let me call him up 
15. PM or right fucking here.   I'll outbid you you inaz 
The Nazis produced a lot of currency especially over occupied territory during the war so it's probably not that hard to find especially at militaria shows. 
No, you see, you have to end it something like: "My advice would be to take this to an appraiser immediately. He'll be able to give you much more information than I could given that I specialize in coins from around 1998 when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell. 
Maybe put it behind some glass, on a pedestal.  Maybe dedicate a room to it with other Nazi related historical finds.  You could get some flags and put them up around the walls.    You wouldn't want people going through your junk drawer to get the wrong idea.
