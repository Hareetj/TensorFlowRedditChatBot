Perhaps even grandma was abused herself and that could be what drove her to do it. 
Damn. That guy was fully responsible for his own death, you just happened to be there. Lucky he didn't take you with him.  It's a shame, but double the speed limit in the middle of the night with no lights? 100% his fault. 
To hold a stranger's hand in his final moments. You are a beautiful person. I hope you are okay now.  
That seems like it should have definitely been at least a two person job. 
And don't make illegal u-turns like a dumbass. That would've solved the issue.  
Thats not your fault. You didn't let somebody too drunk drive. Thats what you're *supposed* to do. 
He got to spend his last few days with his grandkids, and helping his child through a rough patch. If you could ask him, I bet he wouldn't regret his decisions at all. 
why did he attack you? was he on drugs or had a mental breakdown? 
You can't live your life at the beck and call of everyone else. It's healthy to take time for yourself. I'm sorry that this happened in this case and I understand why you feel guilty, but you couldn't have known. 
As part of my job, I work with seniors to improve their reflexes and balance.  These are things that degrade with age.  In most demographics, falls kill more older adults than anything other than heart disease and cancer.  People with good balance and quick reflexes rarely seriously injure themselves from a fall.  Your grandfather in his younger years could have recovered from his misstep, or could have gotten his arms out in front of him in time.  Frailty, decline, and bad luck killed your grandfather, not you.  It could have been a crack in a sidewalk. 
Sometimes people do this as a means of suicide.   It's unfortunate you were involved and had to deal with the fallout but it wasn't your fault.  
I wonder how many lives you unknowingly saved by repoing someone's car. 
It may take or have taken you a long time to believe this, or maybe you never will, but you did him a really big favour.  
I had a similar but less serious incident as an adult in Taiwan. A friend dropped me off at the place I was staying. I opened the door on the kerb side and a kid on a bicycle slammed into it. He was ok, a few scratches. What some may not realize is that sidewalks are uncommon in Asia and so the area between buildings and cars is still road. The reaction of my friends suggested this was my fault and I should have looked before opening the door. 
You aren't clairvoyant. I know you're in this profession to help and I completely understand the frustration, anger and sadness that comes with hindsight, but please don't beat yourself up when all of your efforts and training don't turn out to be magic. Focus on the people you do save, while still having sympathy for the ones you couldn't. I'm positive the former outweighs the latter.  
My girlfriend gets pissed when I don't respond to that kind of thing while doing something potentially dangerous. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm afraid of.    I'm sorry for your loss man. 
Do you remember this or did your parents tell you?  
You say that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but hey, you're alive. Sure, it would be great if that man had survived, but if he had been in front of you, you'd be the dead one, and he'd be typing up this comment now. I know that it sucks that you had to be involved in something like this, but fate works in cruel, yet mysterious ways. Maybe the guy would have died the next day from a heart attack or something? I know, still awful to think about, but look on the bright side: at least you weren't texting and driving. If that had been the case, then yeah, it would have been a lot more awful if someone had died because you were distracted, but that's not what happened. The other guy just got really unlucky that day. 
Neither of you knew about his condition.  He was essentially a ticking-time bomb.  The circumstances of it suck, but it's not your fault. 
Hey, it might not have been your kit that was used. Even if it was, you had no way of knowing what would happen. 
Was she disabled? I don't see any other reason besides that for not being able to just do it herself. Or maybe she had some kind of traumatic freak out doing it herself so he tried and got freaked out too? I don't know. 
Way to stop a secret agent you dick. Mr. Hoover is going to be pissed when he finds out you foiled his plans    
How does one "do it right"? I'm genuinely curious.  
This has some twisted backwards karma going on. Let a murderous psychopath go, then a murderous psychopath lets him go.  
Supervisor be like "It says here he's a donor... We really need brains" 
An overlooked sign of abuse, I feel, is when a kid is way too mature and cool-headed for their age. That 12-year-old knew exactly what to do and how to protect her brother from the sight - which means she either had to do so before, or was mentally prepared for the possibility. 
Wow.  To think that this could have been how I ended up. Except I survived my time in the dumpster and was rescued weighing 2 lb.  Thank you guys for what you do. 
yikes, this one is awful and would've been so creepy to see in person. 
One of my work colleagues was on jury duty for a case where a lady of the evening died on the freeway after falling out of a pickup truck. The driver's defense was that "out of nowhere, for no reason, she just opened the door and jumped out while we were in the middle of the freeway."   
It's one thing to want to take your own life, but how dare you take someone else with you. 
She stared a literal dagger at you and you just went on by? Damn. 
god damn...that sounds weird as fuck. i didn't know blood did that either. 
I was at the hospital drunk as hell at like 2am a couple months ago (went to the bars with some friends and a female friend got drugged and no one wanted to take her to the hospital). I hear a lot of noise so I open the curtain and there's a guy covered in blood. According to the nurse he was high on Meth and picked huge chunks of skin off and cut himself. If I was any more intoxicated you could have convinced me the zombie apocalypse was happening just by the looks of him.  
Oh man, I bet they hung themselves in the attic so their kids didn't walk in on that sight. 
Burglar/necrophiliac was pretending to be a corpse and ran out when you weren't looking.  Or the start of the next Mummy movie. 
See, I do my best not to be an overprotective parent, then I read shit like this. 
What was the outcome? If you could still smell the alcohol the person must have still been around. 
"Attention pumpkinfucker!  Do you need assistance?!" 
You know it's going to happen, but I wonder how the dogs handle this psychologically on the back end given the pack/owner relationship? 
This is the reason my 4 year old knows the proper words. And I am thankful for it since she was able to tell me a couple months ago that her older half brother had put a Nerf bullet up her vagina.         The matter has been investigated and is being dealt with.    She has not been to her fathers house since the incident happened.       ETA - in the thread below there is more information about the incident.      I am done for the night on responding as I have now given my self a headache from thinking about it and need to just unwind and not think about the situation for a bit.     Thank you all for your support and kind words.    
When you say he was resisting. Do you mean he was trying to assert his dominance? 
that's enough internet for today. How fucking sickening and tragic.  
Having been on the other side of that, I gotta say your mind illogically defaults to "not mine" faster than you can weigh the consequences of confessing. You know how that's going to go, you know resistance is futile, you know it's better to confess and accept that you've been busted...but no way, that's not yours.

A boat off the coast of Germany sends an SOS, "We're sinking, we're sinking!" The coastguard responds after a few seconds, "Okaaay, vaht are you sinking about?" 
Two soldiers are in a tank. One looks at the other and says "GLUB GLUB GLUB" 
You might know, but there is a much longer version of this joke. It is my favourite joke. The reactions you get from the punchline are worth however long you make the buildup.  
I've always heard the more subtle, "Two men walk into a bar but the third man ducks."  I like the knock knock set-up though. 
Similar one:   What's the difference between a buffalo and a bison?   Can't wash your hands in a buffalo.

This I like. Here's mine:  How can you fit four elephants into a Mini Cooper? Two in the front, two in the back.  How do you kill a blue elephant? With a blue elephant gun.  How do you kill a red elephant? With a red elephant gun.  How do you kill a pink elephant? You choke it 'til it's blue, and you shoot it with a blue elephant gun.  How can you tell if there's an elephant in your refrigerator? Because there's tracks in the butter.  How can you tell if you have two elephants in your refrigerator? You can hear them giggling.  How can you tell if there are three elephants in your refrigerator? Because the door closes, but only just.  How can you tell if you have four elephants in your refrigerator? Because there's a Mini Cooper parked outside. 
Nice try, German. You'll never develop your own weaponized joke.

That is someone who is on day 13 of their two week notice. 
Say what you want, but I respect that she saw she was acting like that, and instead of taking what her daughter told her as an insult, actually thought to give her grandson a good first bday and go cool off. Crazy, but self aware enough to know to go calm the hell down. 
That's correct. We don't care about your cheeseburger  
Plot twist: there's no sensor it's just a guy watching the cameras waiting for peak rage before he opens the gate. 
I hope their son grows up to be well adjusted and not follow in his parents footsteps and become a raging douchebag. I hope, but it's unlikely.  
a friend of mine feels this way about his GF's mother. She is legit batshit crazy. She makes passive aggressive comments to him if he is ever near her, and most of the time she just ignores his existence because in her mind, her daughter should be with some rich lawyer or doctor. But her real lunacy comes with her family. She treats her husband like a dog (even though he is the one holding her leash) and she started leveraging herself against her daughter so she would break up with my buddy. She stopped helping her pay fro nursing school, she took away the car that was in their name (even though her daughter paid for most of it), and during one of their arguments, she was riding with her mom and gets tired of her shit and told her to stop the car, she was getting out. The car comes to a stop, and she almost gets out, but her mom just floors it, almost knocking her out of the car. Total loony. 
I will never understand the people who try to buy coffee in the mornings and then complain they're going to be late when it's not ready in 2.5 seconds. At the Starbucks I go to, this happens every morning. It's like, dude, if waiting 2 minutes for your coffee is going to cause you to be late, you were already running late. It's not the employees' fault at that point.  
To be fair, the McDonalds near me literally never puts the sauce in the bag and i have to go back and ask for it everytime. Its frustrating, but hell, I'm not gonna act like a fucking 5 year old and assault people with it. Fuck that guy 
My daughter thinks it's the coolest thing in the world to see a dog with a job. It just blows her mind lol. She does know not to mess them.  
Hospitality industry nightmares. I work in a small boutique hotel with no security and a couple of years ago a guest had a nervous breakdown that lasted for about two hours. Her husband left her in the city center and she somehow couldn't get back to the hotel, started blaming us. Accused us all of being racist because she's Iraqi, accused the taxi driver of wanting to rape her, got in my face to the point I thought she was going to hit me. She was screaming so loudly the other guests locked themselves in their rooms.  It was the worst thing I have ever witnessed from a human being.  
The manager has some spectacular timing...almost like they were waiting until assface left. 
Doesn't sound that hard, I mean, $150, what could that be? Like 15 bananas?  
Being kind, polite, and reasonable to airline employees has always netted me the biggest favor payouts for literally the least amount of effort. Seriously.   
I don't know that I follow.  If they were both facing each other (head on?), why would one be trying to pass the other?  
When I worked as a cashier at a supermarket, our bag boy was sent to run and pick up a jar of jam for a customer ringing up who forgot to grab it ('cause he wasn't doing anything, she had a long order, and she had been decently nice thus far). When he brought it back it was apparently sugar free, and this pissed her off and she threw it at the customer service desk in anger and it exploded everywhere.   Also had several people go nutso and start throwing food when they got angry. Milk was the worst, followed by yogurt and glass items. Thankfully they never threw wine.   This was at a fancy grocery store too. In a nice part of town. People were just ridiculous occasionally.  
No doubt in my mind that he opened a few bags to cherry pick and stuff the one bag he was so insistent was sold by the the bunch as well. I know that type of shopper, that's why he got so pissed, all that effort for naught. 
fucking with airport security is typically a quick way to not get on your flight and be treated to a shiny new pair of steel bracelets. did she not get hauled away for this?  
I work with a rage-a-holic also. She snaps at everyone about the most miniscule things and management dismisses her bad behaviour because she's "had a hard life", but when I point out that half of the people in here have had a hard life and don't act like that, I'm the asshole.  
I can see that place pushing mild-mannered parents into full-on freakouts. Like, when I was a kid, I never understood why my mom and dad were total dicks on our big group family vacations to Florida - now that I've pulled a few family vacations as leadership (along with my wife), it's easier to see how the stress gets to you.   Throw in high expense and a well-intentioned pressure to provide your family with a total white-glove experience and I get why some people might freak out. Hell, I could see *myself* losing my shit in that heat/cost/general situation.  
Once that guy was sober, I'd insist that he pay everyone back, as the decent thing.  
Obviously she knew that you were secretly The Weather God and the lifeguard thing was just a cover.  I was behind a couple in a store that spent 5 minutes bitching to the cashier about the traffic (there had been a bad accident nearby, the traffic was horrible).   The cashier got fed up, and with a deep voice announced "Traffic Begone!" while waving his hands at the windows.  He paused, turned back to the couple and said "well, obviously my superpowers are gone."  The couple was just so stunned they shut up, paid and left.     
I used to work in an ice cream parlour and the amount of abuse hurled at us was ridiculous. I've worked other customer service jobs, but there's something about ice cream that brought out the worst in humanity.  
I  had a roommate like this, She would go shopping and max out her credit card and then her parents would pay it off repeatedly. She was storming around one day calling her mom a bitch because her mother had asked her to try not to go shopping as much. 
I was expecting the opposite reaction where you all pretend that nothing is happening and avoid eye contact with one another. But I guess there are some instances where one must intervene. I had one of those the other day where I had to call the police when someone in front of me was violently mugged.  
LOL.  I would have responded, "Listen, I can explain this to you, or a police officer can explain this to you." 
Why are people bringing their tissues out of the toilet and putting it in a bin, instead of flushing it down the toilet? 
Wasn't married, but my one and only ex likes to get drunk (alcoholic) and occasionally text me "I hope you fucking die" "fuck you cunt, die" "I hope you fall off a bridge" "I'm gonna drink myself to death tonight and it's your fault"  Aren't people great.  High five for the single life. 
"How dare you say that to my face."  "I'd say it behind your back, but my car's only got half a tank of gas!"  -Al Bundy 
When I was 19, a guy once tried to fight my friend after my friend supposedly cut him off in traffic.  I was in the passenger seat, and this guy pulled up next to us at a red light, rolled down his window and started screaming.  My friend, who just has a gift for pushing buttons, kept needling the guy until the guy looked like he was about to have an aneurysm.  The guy gets out of his horribly-painted camo low-rider pickup truck, takes a few steps towards our car, and my friend laughs, waves, and takes off as the light changes to green.  In the rearview mirror, we watched as two lanes of traffic start angrily honking at this guy because he's blocking one lane and his car is blocking the other. 
Say something.  Couples can tend to get absorbed in themselves and fail to have an outside perspective that could help them.  "I'd like to come over but your husband's outbursts make me a bit uncomfortable at times, would you like to go out to eat alone instead?"  Make the problem clear but also make it clear you aren't avoiding them, you're just avoiding the situation.  Which is fair - he isn't your husband, you shouldn't have to put up with that the same way. 
oh my god, how hideous for your great grandmother. to have to go through the grief of losing him not once but twice... life is so fucking cruel. 
I'm sorry for your losses, they both passed away too early. 
I have an aunt who is twice widowed (my late uncle was her second husband) and lost a son in a car accident. What you said about Facebook pretty much sums up her timeline. My uncle has been dead for 8 years, her son a few years longer, and first husband even longer than that. I can't imagine carrying so much grief for so long. 
This is honestly the possibility that terrifies me. She's got a chronic disease that will likely kill her relatively early, but at least we know about that and can sort of see things coming, even if it's going to be sudden if it happens. This, though... you plan for all the known variables, you think you're ready, then something totally unexpected happens and throws it all out the window. Life happens, and that's the scariest fate of all. 
Hug her tight. My dad died on the way to work. This thread has made me sad :( 
This is sad and sweet at the same time. I'm glad they found each other.  
Fucking dreams, my dad passed away in 2010 and I still dream he is alive and I know he is dying but I haven't spent enough time with him before he dies. Stupid brain, my dad was paliative for over 6 months and I had plenty of time with him before he passed away, but NO, my brian has to try to screw with me 
My mother said something similar about her first husband who died young. I was always conscious that her great love wasn't my dad but she told me that it wasn't fair to compare as they only had a few years and who knows how they would have ended up.  
I'm a widower too and have tried to start dating again recently. Acceptance is one of the biggest parts of grieving, and to try and think what I'd do if she were still here...well I can't even process that question. Like you said, it hurts to just read it.  
Sorry for your loss. It's an interesting discussion though. At 35, I am totally different to who I was at 20 when I met my partner, but we've grown together.   If I met the 19 year old her we'd probably not get on and if I met the 34 year old her without having been together in the interim, we might be totally different people too.  We are so shaped by the people close to us, it's impossible to say how different we'd be without them (or rather with different ones) 
Sending a hug your way! I am sorry for your loss.  
I like this. Before my nana died last summer, we were talking about how she hadn't remarried even years after my grandpa died. She said "why settle for hamburger when you've had steak all your life?" 
Stay strong. If you ever need to chat, please hit me up. You mean the world to someone and you matter to this world. All the best. Strength and love to you. 
My grandfather unexpectedly died in his 30's from a medical issue. My grandmother eventually met and married a man who also lost his spouse. In the end, they were married about four times longer than either of their first marriages, yet they both decided to be buried next to their first spouse.  It surprised a lot of people, but it was a decision based on logic more than choosing one person over another. Both had children from their first marriage and they never had any children together. They decided they wanted their children to be able to visit both their parents at the same place. My grandmother said she didn't really care where her body was since she wasnt going she be using it, so she thought about the people who would care. Even in death, she's doing her best to avoid inconveniencing others. 
Yikes. Was he suffering from any known mental illnesses or stuff like that? 
I think the talking about your grandfather is mostly because for some reason earlier memories get preserved better. Towards the end my grandmother would often ask my grandfather to go home to her parents :/ 
Was everything ok in your relationship when he announced his desire to transition? You mentioned the thing about being at the height of the relationship when a partner dies, do you feel like you were there at that time?   Was he happy in the relationship (though obviously not in himself)?   Did he want to stay with you after transitioning?    Ignore me if these are too personal, I'm just really interested.  
That whole show is full of "what would you do?" scenarios. I can't wait for the second season! 
Is a mistress a mistress if she doesn't know she's helping someone cheat? 
There's a French series called Les Revenants which has a similar dynamic between a now married woman, her ex that committed divide and her new husband. It's Kinda about zombies but they're not rotting and stuff, they just look normal but keep coming back from the dead. Think there's an American adaptation. 
I find it a very interesting question. Better than most questions asked here. 
Man. My "shelf broke" when I was 17 but the whole zombie sister wife/unmarriable widow double standard was always hard to choke down. Especially since it was highlighted in my favorite books, Tennis shoes among the Nephites. Men can have eternal marriages after their wives die. If a widow tries to remarry it's  not a "binding" marriage--it's a marriage for the next few years until her original spouse claims her in the afterlife. It devalues widows (who were specifically noted (by Jesus Christ)  as a group that should receive community support ) and makes them into concubines.  Blargh. R/exmormon is love. R/exmormon is not life cause religion or lack there of should never define your life.  
Sir, are there you aware that our planet is spherical? 
My exhusband is convinced that whomever you marry first is who you are forced to spend eternity with, and keeps accusing me on Twitter of screwing him out of a good afterlife. Uh... no.  
So you're the reason everyone has to watch those safety videos. 
Went to a timeshare presentation in Mexico. The guy hit us up leaving the airport. As this was not our first time, we entered the room with the lady who was pitching, and told her "in all honesty, we will listen to your pitch, but we are not buying anything. We are only here for the free stuff."  She was PISSED. Told us we were wasting people's time, and gave us the vouchers and told us to leave. But not before I chewed her ass about blindsiding people who had just got off a plane and were looking forward to a vacation.  Totally worth it, and didn't have to even listen to the hour long pitch. 
Still use hydrogen peroxide based cleaner for my soft contacts. Every now and then it gets me. Terrible feeling. Need to get contacts out because they are burning your eyes so bad. Eyes are burning so bad you can't open them to get the contacts out. Super sucks. 
What was the experience like while eating them? You say "peaches" so you infer you are more than just one? Why did your grandmother keep these peaches for 45 years?  There's so many details you're keeping from us. 
God this reminds me of a cringy story from my elementary school years.   Bigger kid in class got cast as Santa Claus in a school play.  I walk to Biggest girl in class room and asks if she tried out for Mrs. Santa Claus.  She asks, "Why?"  Immediately say, "Cuz you're fat..."  As the words left my mouth, so did my lunch, cuz she punched my square in the balls, which I rightfully deserved.  I'm sorry, Sandy. I was young, stupid, and didn't have a filter.  
Just reading the name *Southern Comfort* made my stomach roll. Apparently Southern Comfort and I have a history.  
 I had a similar situation, but mine was with rum. My mother would put red packets of koolaid flavoring or whatever those things are called into a gallons of water. It would turn the water into koolaid or rather that's what it's for. She would keep the gallon of koolaid next to an empty gallon of water which she filled with rum.   Anyways i poured it in a cup and took a gulp of "koolaid" followed by "EWW MOM THIS TASTES LIKE MEDICINE! Wasn't pleasant... 
Lent $1k to a co-worker once. Took almost 6 months to get it back, meanwhile she is posting pics of her out on the town and doing expensive activities while claiming she "doesn't have it yet". Haven't spoken to her since.  
honestly, it's a wild ride but not a bad one. felt like my bits were being gently warmed in the hands of a lover and at the same time like i was teabagging a stream full of glacial meltwater.   kinda exhilirating.

You need to be careful with that, with some medicines that are designed to be time released, that is a good way to overdose.    
I rented a beach cabin with 7 other people. 3 of them were content with just sitting on the beach, the rest of us got antsy and wanted to do things like play mini golf and visit a few breweries. The 3 beach bums were highly incensed that we wanted to split off. They didn't get that we're all adults and not everybody has to always be doing the same thing all the time. 
Maybe it would have been a good idea to explore the rest of Wendy's menu instead of going on an all-Baconator diet.  
Crawling trough a tight hole where you don't have any opportunity to turn around and crawl back? Imagine your flash light breaking down as well.   Big nope for me.  
"Never again!" after the next time after this one.   Promise.  
I did the crumb hunt when I tried it too.. once I realized what I was doing I just sat there and cried. Never again. 
When you say icing, I'm pretty sure you ment holding ice to your eyes, but I pictured the sugar paste kind. 
Christ we ate so much venison growing up, I once caught my dad rubbing his head on the bannister.  
My father said this after we were in China and he ate a Korean sasuage from a street vendor, about 10 hours later he broke lose the biggest fart I've heard on the streets. I could see in his face that something was wrong, very wrong and he just said to my mom; we have to get to the hotel now."  Now we jokingly say "never trust a fart"

I can't speak for all of pregnancy, but first trimester is absolutely horrible.   Can't tell if you're hungry or full, throw up multiple times in a day, hate literally all food....  Luckily, we picked the 2 for 1 deal, so after this pregnancy we'll have two kids and be done. 
I was only 4 years old when I tripped on an escalator and it really tore open my knee. Lots of blood running down my leg and everything.   I'll be 28 next week and while I have moved past the avoiding escalators altogether, I still get a little nervous and often need a moment to make sure I'm timing my step properly, and I have to have a hand free to hold the rail or it's not happening. 
Coming from a pack a day smoker I genuinely wish I could say "never again".  
The Blazin sauce used to be different. Now it is made with ghost peppers (allegedly) and not what they used to use.

One or both parties always end up catching feelings. I thought it was bad being the one that had no interest, and now I'm on the other side and I want to die. 
I know it's so hard right now, but in time, it will get easier. 
Who cares about the box. It's what's on the inside that matters.  
This sounda like something ray leota would say while narrating good fellas 
"They're gonna have to see this stuff eventually. It's part of growing up" 
I'd punch someone if they ever said any of that to me in a funeral. 
Do they hate each other cause they fucked in the beginning and dad married her sister or what? 
My wife's identical twin sister is the best sister ever and she has no one else in the town of a tangerine.   Swear to god real iPhone suggestions 
She uh... brought her twin to your date? She kind of started the awkward train if you ask me.  
I like the different colors thing. Who wears the original? 
Do you ever think your brother started dating her twin because he thought your girl was a hottie 
That's crazy. That is literally the last thing I would ever think to ask the sister of the girl I was dating.  
Well said...I'm not gonna lie, my girlfriend's sister is *fucking* attractive. I HATE feeling this way, but her personality does not mesh with mine like it does with my girlfriend. 
My SO's dad has an identical twin who lives in another state with his family. Every once in a while his mom gets calls from concerned friends who don't know that he's a twin.  "I just want you to know I saw your husband with another family"  "Oh no that's his twin brother" 
I dated a girl who had an identical twin. My girlfriend was studying in the US, but her family lived in South America. We went to visit her family, and I met her twin, and her twins fiancee for the first time at a family party.   I few beers later, I came up behind 'my girlfriend' and started rubbing her shoulders...it was not my girlfriend, it was her twin. Her fiancee was watching me the entire time and was just giggling. Luckily he thought it was funny.  
This chick has clearly never seen a bowl of ice cream. There's literally nothing stopping me dishing up two and spooning both of them.  Could you tell them apart from which one was bad at analogies?  
I can explain this. I can't always tell which person I am in the photo when I am younger.  Usually, I have to look at which one is my twin and then realize: she's that one, so this one is me.   I think it is because I saw her 10000 a day when we were kids, but I only saw myself in the mirror when I was brushing my teeth.  So in my mind, I am looking for my mirror image.  Also, we shared clothes so that doesn't help unless I can see our watches or necklaces that we used to help our parents and teachers know who we were.  And sometimes shoes, I guess. 
Makes me wish that at some point in the future I could go to some fancy cloning clinic with a hair follicle, and be like "hey can you duplicate this but make it gayer this time around?  I guess that raises weird age issues though, even if they came out looking 30 
A close neighborhood friend of mine had twin sisters growing up. He was a year older than me, them a year younger. The whole crew paid very little attention to them until high school rolls around. They blossomed like a lotus flower.   I always knew they were off limits, but one time hanging in his basement another (drinking problem) friend started blabbering about how he was going to get with them and my other friend (who I think was also drunk, but not as much so) freaked out, punched a hole in the wall and dared him to say that again. He did, and promptly received a couple hooks to the face.  
The situation with the brother's girlfriend sounds interesting. Can you come up with any examples? 
Definitely misread that as "my girlfriend had long dark hair and dressed like a nipple" 
Holy shit I haven't thought about that anime in a while... 
I've never thought about why, but you're right, I have two brothers and have always been a bit standoffish with their wives, and I think you hit the nail on the head with your 'why'. 
Lots of carefully thought out answers in this thread.  But here's the truth. 
Nothing awakens me more than calling my girlfriend's mom "babe"  
If I'm honest,  I figured Jimmy Carr would have a cleverer user name.  
A long time ago the company I worked for had a similar situation. We had contracted a guy to do some programming for us and he wasn't delivering what he promised. Looking for prior experiences others may have had with him we Googled his freelancing email, which promptly returned the many forum posts he had made on creepshot/voyeur forums. 
On the bright side, if you decide to find a third, you know where to look 
Well when you're sleeping next to someone who feels like they care about you more than your wife, it's kind of understandable. Never been married, never had an escort, but feeling alone when your with the person who is supposed to love you sucks.    Have thought about hiring an escort just to hang out with lol. I'm sad.  
asking for a friend, what's the average amount of tips do dancers usually get from one client? 
She didn't know him at all apparently. That's so sad. 
For a while I was expecting the ending to be that the wife ended up paying your friend for services too.    
These people's SOs do realize that it's usually the client who initiates contact, right? So telling the escort not to contact the client again is just stupid. 
That's a genius cover actually. Offering the free trip made you out to be a telemarketer which would make sense to have on your phone.  
so, sir, we have your underage daughter on drug charges here...oh and um prostitution. 
Any time you ask Reddit a question you'll usually just a thousand "I'm not what you asked for but..." replies. If OP was smart he'd have tried reverse psychology. 
Thats so epic, imagine seeing some girl trying to put her clothes on scrambling out of a house with a gun and throwing it in a random dumpster before running off lmao  me irl 
so interesting.  a girlfriend from my past was super jealous of a close female friend i had and she said she'd rather i fuck some random babe than have an emotional affair with this friend.  
Well yeah you're not gonna hear from him if you block his number 
"So what does that make me?"      "Absolutely nothing." 
The lesson here is to never escort without your robe and wizard hat. 
That's fucked. So that shit is still happening? If your friend couldn't get the cops or cps to do anything maybe you can. It's really fucked up to hear that someone is hurting a child but no one is doing anything about it. Go be a hero, please.  
Last weekend I went with my mother to a memorial and on the way back we passed a car with their lights off. I gave him a quick flash of my lights and the other car immediately turned their own lights on. My mom, however, was horrified. "Don't DO that! Don't you know what that means?!"   Uh... it means they didn't notice their lights were off?  
Okay so I watched a documentary on killer bees years ago when I was about 7 and it fucked me up big time...had night terrors about being chased by killer bees that resulted in my sleep walking...well sleep running through the house and running into furniture. Had these night terrors off and on for a few years until the Internet became widespread and I could do my own independent research and figure out that Discovery Channel documentary I watched when I was 7 was less than credible... 
I heard about this too and have never once actually encountered this. Also if your blowjob skills are so weak you can see the other girls lipsticks then what are you even doing. And also gross. This feels like one of those dateline tonight episodes our  moms all watched before demanding to know if we were involved when we got home from school.  
Definitely thought it was supposed to be an analogy. "Spread like a syringe in a ball pit." 
I guess you remember the particularly bad ones. That's probably normal. 
I have the opposite. I've never heard anyone complain about it, but I've definitely seen people post it and thought "fuck off" to myself. 
Every few months there's an ask reddit post going "what items would you combine to freak out a cashier?" and the comments are always the most try-hard nonsense. No one who works in a place that sells everything under the blue sky is gonna go "ohshit he's a rapist!" because you bought a knife, rope, and lube, or that you're gonna fuck a gerkin because you bought condoms to go with it. Because generally speaking people don't use the shit they buy *at the same time*. Why on earth would you think the cashier would think anything beyond "gerkins to eat, lube and condoms for the bedroom, oh god he's looking at me like a creep, and he smells, fuck, just avoid his eyes...." Like do you look at a guy buying a cartful of groceries, sweets, and toilet paper and assume he's gonna turn all that into some weird fiber-filled stew?    And yes, I *am* fun at parties, fuck you very much. 
I remember my good friend's dad believed this whole-heartedly about Obama. He once said, "That sumbitch came out and said on live tv that he wouldn't give up his power after his second term!" When I asked him to show me where Obama said it he just acted like it was erased from the internet to prevent an assassination attempt. 
Some Jewish people I know like to get Christmas trees and jokingly call them 'Hanukkah bushes'. Everyone's pretty chill with Christmas. 
Taco Bell was my absolute favorite fast food place as a kid and I never had a problem. As an adult I hardly ever go there, maybe like once every couple years, but I still have never gotten sick from it.  It's probably from overeating. That'll give you the loose poops from *any* restaurant food. 
I had one incident, where several people including me(f) entered a hall. Some guy held the door open and a man who was walking in front of me thanked him kindly. "Hodor" said "I'm not holding it for you, I'm holding it for HER!" while pointing at me. I deliberately ignored him for that.  There are people who even make holding a door open seem a dick move. 
I was told to have a "Blessed day" at Michaels the other day. Obviously, public Christianity isn't a problem. 
It totally is a felony. But there's also people who actively seek it, it's called "bug chasing" and it's pretty scary.  
Can confirm. Briefly saw a gay couple once, married a horse that same day. 
The largest spoon collection is reportedly the Bertha Schaefer Koempel Spoon Collection in Paterson New Jersey, USA. It contains over 5,400 individual spoons, and I think it is safe to assume under 10,000.   This probably isn't counting cutlery manufacturers and people who have really large numbers of disposable plastic spoons for various reasons. 
My cousin lives waaay out in the sticks. I mean, they have a use for the phrase "the main dirt road" because they live on a dirt road that is off of another dirt road. It makes the front page of their weekly newspaper when the grocery store has a new manager. Every second or third post on facebook (by some miracle they have decent internet service) is some macho bullshit about being ready for ISIS. A lot of stuff about Muslims too, even though I'd be a little surprised if any Muslims lived within 20 miles of him, or if he'd ever met one. 
The closest I've ever gotten to it is seeing someone I knew who LOOKED like a welfare queen...she was on WIC, so food stamps for people with infants, and had a cell phone, (knockoff) designer purse, nails done, and obviously dyed hair. But her parents still paid for her cell phone (she was married at this point), the bag was less than $20, and she did her own hair and nails (she worked at a salon). But anyone who just glanced at her likely would have thought that she was gaming the system.  
Yes. The only place I've ever seen lots of trigger warnings is shen it's a site/board forbpeople with mental illnesses or a history or severe trauma. And yeah...people with PTSD or anorexia or who cut need trigger warnings 
A muslim family lives down the street from me. I've only talked to the husband briefly, but the only reason I know they're muslim is because my neighbors told me to watch out.  The other day, I saw the father outside, mowing his lawn in cutoffs. It was terrifying.  
Baby-dump is also a shop. They even sponsored a cycling team and it was called Team Baby-Dump. At least if the sales go down, they can start an abortion clinic and keep the signs they already have. 
Went there for my one 13th/14th birthday or something. Despite the shit name that place was *way* better than Chuck E Cheese. Go Karts, peddle boats with water cannons on them, batting cages and a really dope arcade. I remember going on the boats with a pocket full of tickets from the arcade that, instead of using a counting machine, the prize lady weighed. I got hella extra tickets. I do remember that place getting shut down or sold due to a sex offender scandal of some sort. Not sure as I don't live in the area any more. 
"Hello, Allen, Allen, Allen and Allen"  "May I speak to Allen please?"  "Sorry, he's with a very important client and wont be available until tomorrow."  "Then I'll talk to Allen."  "Nope, he's in court for the day, and will be for the next week"  "Is Allen available then?"  "He's on vacation for another two weeks?"  "Okay, then can I please speak to Allen?"  "Speaking..." 
I once had two friends who both went by "other Josh". 
That actually doesn't seem weird to me.  Video rental has become a rural business because many of those areas still have limited streaming ability.  Chainsaw repair is also a rural business.  And because rural areas have fewer customers, it makes sense that they would not be able to support themselves with just one customer base.  There's a video rental place I pass by sometimes that is in the middle of the woods (still on a main road, though), and they do other things as well.  Hunting gear, fishing bait, etc... 
That laughing accident would have brought him more business. He's a genius 
I mentioned it lower down but there is a Pho King in Phoenix.  
Out in the prairies of Canada there are Rape fields as far as the eye can see.   Rape is the proper name of the plant Canola oil comes from. 
Yeah having associations with a pedophile kind of seems like a good reason to rebrand... 
Unicum is a really good name, it just sucks that it has 'cum' in it now.  The word means 'a unique example or specimen.'  That would be dope to have a design company named that. 
Dont forget about Pump 'n Munch, another Iowa gas station chain. 
I know someone whose name is Bich N'ga. So glad she pronounced it for me when I met her. 
"My name is Feedler... I'm gonna be *on the roof...* FEEDLER ROOFING COMPANY!!!" 
Boring, he should have gone with "Vegetas", "Beer Gun Festival", "Furtive Gals", "Vibrant Eel Fudge", "A Vengeful Birds Teat", or "Federal Vintage Tubs" 
There's a place in town called Kuts Klips & Kurls. Like, I get what they were going for with the same letter repeated, but ALL OF THOSE WORDS ALREADY START WITH "C".  
The A is so the company is at the top of an alphabetical list 
There's one around here that has a bright yellow honey wagon called the "stool bus". 
I guess I'm the only one who thought "Jew will restore"... 
I'm not far from there and my wife wants sushi on our date tonight.  I know where I am going now.  And she thinks Reddit is a waste of time! 
We actually have a site called publin.ie that documents pubs in Dublin. 
We have one nearby called "Shear Today, Gone Tomorrow" 
In Dublin currently, just saw knobs and hookers which is a bit of a white elephant shop, gets attention so I guess it's a good name 
There is a "Rustic Razor" barbershop near mine. Makes me wonder if the clientele needs regular Tetanus shots. 
I ate at a chain called Dicks Last Resort once. It is basically a Joes Crab Shack but the waiters are super rude as a gimmick. Pretty fun place, definitely gotta go in with a good attitude.  
I saw a liquor store called Discount Liquor but the sign was broken so it said Disco Liquor. That was a better name 
Actually, They get new amazing deals on the shelves every Tuesday morning. Not sure if they do that now, but that's why they named it that.  
I love my nachos with just the chips and cheese microwaved then add the salsa on top so it's still cold 
You should start a new weight loss trend "The Broke Diet". 
Why don't you just get a bag of corn chips instead of crackers? Slightly less crappy nachos. 
Wait is the coffee cup used to keep most of the explosion contained?  
Without a glass of milk that meal is like a slow death sentence.  
The problem is the people with the laziest food suggestions are too lazy to comment. The world may never know true Lazy Cuisine. 
Dude,  you forgot some coffee and a Hot Pocket in your microwave at home. 
You and my 4 year-old daughter share this belief. She wouldn't even consider regular chicken nuggets until I told her they were dinosaur eggs. 
Yeah, and when you're not home, always keep a pocket dog handy. 
In Norway, this is generally the way to go, except we use potato tortillas. 
I also eat peanut butter straight from the jar. My husband thinks it's weird but it's delicious and filling. No need for bread, just two or three spoonfuls of PB will get you through the day. 
Idk man, i don't consider dodging 5 flights of stairs lazier than cereal 
Get the multicolored pasta from Target. Makes you feel 10x fancier 
You can save a lot of time by softening the potatoes in the microwave while the oven warms up  
That sounds amazing, and "Stuff" is the perfect name for it. 
Our definitions of lazy differ by approximately  0.6 Garfields.  
So easy and so delicious. A little bit of HP, Chili Powder and Cayenne Pepper if you want to get creative. 
Add a couple cans of tuna and extra shredded cheese. It is amazing. 
Try some lentils and shit like that bro. Ramen is sometimes food. 
That used to be my meal for when I wanted to impress myself. 
Fuck yes Spaghetti Aglio e Olio! Easy to learn, but difficult to master and get the balance of flavours just right. Spent months trying to consistently cook a balanced dish.  
People definitely overestimate how hard steak is to cook. No need to dirty anything but one pan, takes less than 5 minutes to cook, add a pad of butter if you are feeling daring.  
For some reason I pictured you covering this with milk and nearly gagged. I guess it's time to go to bed.  
Why are you dirtying an extra bowl when you have a perfectly good measuring cup to eat out of 
As delicious as this sounds, that's a lot of work when most of us are thinking mac n' cheese or rice with butter. Chopped cilantro for fucks sake do I look like Gordan Ramsey??  Just putting in the effort to add the apostrophe after the n has me thinking about calling off work  
I once dipped uncooked tortellini in dressing and ate that for dinner. It takes 5 mins to cook the tortellini but that was just too difficult.  
In 1991, I had what was referred to as a Prince Valiant. I was in sixth grade. It was my choice and my parents let me do it. I never want to do that again. 
There it is. Those damn Hawaiian shirts and frosted tips haha. I was a rural Midwest kid looking like fucking Guy Fieri for picture day.  
Dude. I was a poor kid in an affluent school. The cool kids did it right. They wore baseball jerseys and loose jeans backwards. I wore kind of tight jeans and a collared dress shirt backwards once. Never again. Stayed in my lane from then on.  
Me too, looked great with my JNCOs, chain wallet, and black doc Martins. 
Ah yes, so we're the same age. Gotta have the frosted tips and that flip-up in the front, too. 
The mother of one of my friends when I was a kid got one of those.  She only wore it once to my knowledge.  Mostly because when she put it on it ended up with two brightly colored circles over her boobs.  Awkward. 
Minus the mullet, I think this phase is coming back, but in a more modern version.  
90's? We did this with men's briefs. Jeans falling off our hips and Calvin Klein briefs sticking out, tight belly shirt and pierced belly button. The fashion was stupid but I had nice abs back then so no regrets. 
I wanted to be a cool scene/emo kid at school and I couldn't afford all the stuff other girls had, too! I had the sweeping hair and cheap, shitty eyeliner layered on thick... and the most embarrassing part is that I took a selfie at school like that. Black and white, I was looking down, etc. and I'll admit that it wasn't a bad picture as far as teen selfies go, but my mother insisted that it was just such a pretty picture of me that she put it on her computer, enlarged it, printed it and put it in a frame. It's hanging up in our kitchen ten years later. 
Differing shoes sounds cute!  I wore the same black Converse through my entire school life, but I put mismatching laces in them... at the height of my emo phase, I had a Green Day lace in one and a My Chemical Romance one later. By the time I got bored of changing them, one foot had a sparkly pink lace and the other was rainbow leopard print. I thought I was so cool. 
The problem with goggles and quirky shit like that is you have no justification for wearing it. I want to wear goggles like Naruto all the time but I don't weld that often or have sandstorms that justify it. It is cool for the people that actually make it functional.  
Fuck I forgot about rat tails. Those were always hilarious to me. I remember I had a fake clip on one though to look like anakin skywalker when I had stick fights with my friends 
Yes, my sister and I use to think it was so cute after we saw a character from a show wearing it. We also wore pants with skirts. All of the other kids thought we rocked in the fashion department.  
I don't know when you did it but that was definitely a late 80's-early 90's trend. 
My dad and his buddies were so mad about the feather trend because it inflated the prices of fly tying (for fishing) supplies. 
My mom would patch mine with iron on butterflies and flowers! I thought I had the nicest pants out of all the elementary school girls. 
My sister went through a major industrial goth phase that's still wearing off a decade later. She got very into adding chains to pants for a while - but on budget.  Many dollar store dog leashes and chains were butchered for her look. She even went so far as to go to a hardware store and buy about 36 inches of industrial, welded chain.   Each link was about about 2.5 inches long by 1.25 inch (62mm x 38mm). Not sure what gauge,  but it was some fat chain.  The thing must have weighed a couple pounds (1kg+), not sure how her pants stayed up.  Good thing she was always wearing like three belts, only two of them weren't doing any work. 
I bought a pair of cat ears designed like Marie from The Aristocats at Disneyland and wore them to school every day for a whole year. Funny thing was, I'd never even seen The Aristocats, I just really loved cats! 
Long hair will never die! It's usually just that people get day jobs that they can't look like a heavy metal dirtbag at. 
by keychain do you mean lanyard? if so then I still do it. 
Townies. We used to shout mosh mosh get a wash. Then a year later I became a full blown mini mosher. Ah tribal instincts. I used to spend ages making sure just the tip of my shoe lace poked out of the hole, and never dreamed of tying my shoes.   
And you had to wear a couple of pairs of contrasting socks to tuck the roll into with your LaGears with 3 different laces braided on the ends. 
Most of my summer wear consists of cargo shorts and band tees. I don't even care.  
Bodysuits are back and man do I appreciate them now. I hate when my undershirts get untucked from my pants. 
The supreme dick move is to leave the cart in the middle of the space *right next to* the cart return. 
Honestly, I don't like public proposals period. And they're awkward as fuck if both people aren't on the same page and someone gets denied in front of everyone (I'm of the opinion you shouldn't really propose unless you guys have had a full, clear conversation about marriage in private already). 
I know a guy who noticed a new town was starting to grow and purchased two pharmacy licenses for the area (I think it's a 30km exclusion  radius or something).   The rule is that as many licenses can be issued as needed, but the oldest license has preference for trading for the first 25000 residents.   So by buying two, he essentially monopolised the town until the population exceeded 50,000.   He never opened a pharmacy, and sold the first license for $5m and the second for $3m.  
the bag seat is fine as long as other seats are available  not having headphones and listening to your music means we should be able to cut your fucking head off, for all to witness, as a warning to any other motherfucker who thinks that shit is ok 
Sometimes, things splash a bit. Sometimes, fluid pressure gets a bit outta hand. Aint none of us too good to grab a square or two of toilet paper and wipe up after we're done. 
My neighbors do this EVERY DAY and leave the street in front of their house open. Shit pisses me off so much.  
My mom was nine months pregnant with me when it happened to her. She saw who it was, tracked him down in Costco and verbally lambasted him in front of a crowd of onlookers.   People were like what the fuck is going on here? And my mom is just laying into him meanwhile my dad has fucked off somewhere trying to get the shopping done.   But yeah, total dick move.  
Fucking over your literal bro is the most severe violation of the bro code there is, surpassed only by fucking over a twin or litter-mate, with whom you shared a womb not only spatially but temporally. 
Some theaters used to have baby rooms. It's a sound proof room at the back of the theater where you can still watch the movie and hear through speakers, but your screaming potato won't bother anyone.  
Hell, not just minimum wage positions, but any jobs where you have to interact with the public as part of work. My wife has a biology degree and works at a museum taking care of animals (which, yes, involves lots of cleaning their enclosures). People see her cleaning stuff and just sort of assume she's uneducated and treat her like shit. She said one time she was cleaning something and this kid asked their mom what she was doing. The mom said something to the effect of, she's doing what you'll have to do if you don't go to college.  How she didn't snap that woman's neck is a something I will never know. 
Gotta love Cataan. There was one time I asked if someone had sheep to trade, they said "what for?" then played the monopoly card. They were unhappy 
Wtf that's more than just a dick move, it's pure psychotic..  
In the same vein, spitting your gum out on the sidewalk/pavement so someone else steps in it 
Also not putting weights back in the right place. If I have to remove two 10s, a 35, and a random clip just to get that last 45, someone is a douche. 5s go with 5s, 10s go with 10s, 25s with 25s, and so on.  
Yeah.  Goddamn as a child of divorce (one that wasn't that bad all things considered) this should be illegal. 
Yes. I know someone who had a golden retriever with a tumor in its mouth. It got so bad the dog couldn't eat on it's own or even drink water. Maggots we're starting to collect around the tumor because the flesh was starting to rot. The poor pup was constantly bleeding as well. The owners knew for months the dog was suffering but wouldn't put her down because they couldn't emotionally handle it. Bitch, you're dog can't physically handle it.  
I had this happen not too long ago.  My mom and I were the only people at an afternoon movie.  This woman came in with two toddlers and plopped them down next to us.  Then they proceeded to talk through the ENTIRE movie. 
Someone at my school is currently compiling a 20+ page peer review of a group project partner because his partner did nothing, 10 of those pages are references for texts and emails that they had in which they talked about agreeing to do something then not following through. The project was for chemical engineering and over 50% of the final grade and the dude is creating this review during pre-finals weekend, I don't think I've met someone who has ever been this pissed at a partner  
I watched a dude drive onto the dividers in between the roads to pass people stuck at a red light  Fucking Cuntwaffle 
I once got rear ended by a guy who was tailgating me. The car in front of me stopped suddenly to make a turn, so of course I had to stop suddenly also. He didn't get a ticket or anything but his insurance put him at fault for "failure to maintain a safe distance".  
Please remember riding shotgun is a responsibility, not a privilege. You are the co pilot. 
Seriously, the bin is right by the door. It's not like you have to go out of your way to toss your overpriced half-eaten popcorn tub. 
Took me 42 years and some really crap partner's to find the right one, heads up, it will happen.  Little while from now you'll realise it was her loss. 
At the Whole Foods in my town, they have a bunch of parking spots reserved for "carpools." Sure, it's a great way to save carbon emissions, but who the fuck carpools to go grocery shopping? Those spots are always empty. 
Or when they try to start a conversation while you're both pissing. 
Oh it isn't silent. That kitchen staff is pissed especially if it was a busy night.  
In the immortal words of that one sign at Jimmy John's, "a person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter is not a nice person." 
Seriously. My epipen, even with coupons, is still 600 bucks.  
it allows people to claim that they own a "small business" for very little money and effort. it's very popular with soccer moms who have nothing to do but want to feel useful 
I honestly don't understand why it's so hard for parents to control their children. I just took my kids to a local secondhand bookstore. We went into their housewares room, with lots of breakables scattered around for sale. I tell my four year old, "hands to yourself, okay?" "Okay mom."  Two seconds later another mom walks in with her three kids, and the oldest two, maybe 7 & 5, start *ransacking* shit. They knocked over these decoration African masks, split one in half, the other knocked over a coffee cup, shattered that. And what does this mom do? She grabs them and turns around and walks out the door. My 4 year old turned to me and said, "Well, they don't know how to keep their hands to themselves, huh mommy?" "You're absolutely right son, sometimes people just don't care about anything but themselves."   
This last election, South Dakota voted to regulate these types of loans. When the owner of one of the largest pay day loan companies in the state heard about the bill he lobbied to put another bill on the ballot allowing these companies to continue charging the same rates as long as they signed an agreement like they already did.  We voted to regulate rates and voted against allowing contracts to continue using absurd rates. Very shortly after the results were in, the owner of the pay day companies announced he would be closing every business he had in the state, putting hundreds of people out of work. He even closed the doors to his music academy that provided free music lessons to less fortunate children. 
Turning the conversation into how shitty it is when people record someone without their knowledge would have been fun.  
Nope. That's against the law. You can be fined a minimum of like $125. 
Nah man, you use reddit. Obviously you're an unemployed, sheltered no life whos life IS the computer. You didnt go OUT for lunch. 
On airlines like Air New Zealand, they don't let you do this. I've had flight attendants wake me up to tell me I have to put my seat up because it's meal time. 
That is illegal and you can be ticketed for that.  
Nope, that is legitimate strategy. I will never accept that its a dick move. It is a valid game theory option that is very much part of the game rule set. 
Also touching a pregnant woman's belly without permission. You wouldn't reach out and touch someone's stomach uninvited normally, what's the difference now? If anything, it's more rude. 
lite version: Have a couple spare umbrellas in your glove compartment, roll the window down and throw it at passersby.  
Sure it wasn't the signs you were holding that said "Hitler Did Nothing Wrong!"?  I always forget to leave those at home. 
Oh yeah - that's a big no-no.  As a male, you never want to be left alone with a kid. 
I have a half sister as well, loved her as much as my other siblings ever since she was born. If that happened to me, it would hurt bad. I'm sorry this happened to you 
Try all the way to their 3rd floor  apartment because you are neighbors. 
If I look eye level, though, I see their butt.  What now?! 
So if you see a strange lady talking to your niece. Give her an accusatory dirty look, pull your niece away from her and say "what are you doing? Stay away from her." And threaten to call the police yourself. See how they like it.  
I used to work at Domino's as a delivery driver. Whenever I wasn't on a delivery, I'd help out on the phones or whatever. Everything was fine until we hired this stupid, young overweight girl.   I'm a big guy myself, and the space behind the counter was already tight enough, but it seemed like this girl did everything she could to take up as much space as possible. I did everything I could not to touch her as I moved past her, but it was impossible to not touch her at all.   Eventually, she complained to the manager. Thankfully, the GM was an awesome older lady, and I was her most reliable driver, and she basically told me if I wasn't on a run to either man the oven or help out on the line and just stay away from the crazy girl.   Soon after, she tried to do the same thing to another coworker and the manager fired her for creating a hostile work environment.  
You should have told her that if she wasn't there to buy any crack she should probably just move along.  *edit - 13.9K upvotes and reddit gold (thanks!).  From this point on I will never again doubt ThePowerofFarts. 
Yeah... the "neighborhood kids" as i call them always come around when it gets warm to swim in my pool. I used to let them do it whenever they wanted (there are ~5 of them), but now I don't allow it unless my wife is home so she can chaperone instead of me. Looking back on it, it might have looked creepy from the outside, but would have been fine years ago. i would just sit in a chair in the shade and have a drink while the kids went swimming; i was pretty much there to run them to the hospital/home if they got hurt - i pretty much never go swimming (the wife wanted the pool). 
I've experienced this, what the hell is it!?  I'm a woman, I was walking home with my son and his friend (a girl) and her dad. She ran out into the road despite her dad shouting at her not to. He was telling her off when this group of women appears and told him not to shout at her as she was a girl!!!  He rightfully told them to mind their own business but they tried to get me on their side, like beacuse I'm a woman I'd be against a male friend discipling his daughter. I told them to walk on. 
I love when the store worker comes to "rearrange" items on the shelf right next to you. 
Haha, my mate does the same thing.   "I'll just uh. Look over here for some minutes until you're far enough away so that you know I'm not a predator" 
I'm a woman and was accused of trying to abduct a litte boy. We have a playground inside our mall and I was there with my 2 kids. I saw a little boy run out of the play area and I didn't see anyone chasing after him. I looked at my daughter and said watch your brother and I took off after the little boy. He was running as fast as his little legs would let him. I caught up to him and scooped him up and was asking where his mom was. A woman came running out of the play area freaking out and grabbing her son from me. She started screaming at me and calling me a kidnapper. She wouldn't even let me explain. She ended up leaving and I walked back into the play area thinking of how I am going to explain this to police when they show up.  They never did, but I will no longer save another run away child whose parents aren't paying attention.  
I think not friending your students on social media is pretty solid advice for all teachers regardless of gender. 
So with you on that.  My humor is pretty dry. Like 40 percent of it is just saying completely inappropriate things in a deadpan voice. Combined with a button-down appearance, I can usually get a laugh, but it also needs highly specific context.   If someone asks if you're going to the meeting and you say you would rather be anally electrocuted, people at work start to talk.  
90%+ of these posts are men trying to avoid the presumption that they are pedophiles and/or rapists.  Well done, media. 
Dude, my nieces are awesome and I love them. I'll hug them and carry them around everywhere, including in public. No way I'm letting other people's opinions get in the way of being the best uncle I can be. If they don't like it, fuck 'em. They can't do anything to me. 
Wow same here man. I used to be fun and playful around kids but now I do exactly as you do, even towards my own relatives who are kids. It's a sad world we live in.  
I do that without any shame man. Same shit happens to me though so I call it even. 
At least there's a good part. The mom thanked you guys. I have read way too many Reddit stories if moms that either ignore you or flip out as if you had caused the fall.  Props to mom. 
I used to use a pretty basic rule to help this. I'd try to go on a date 3 times. If they gave an excuse for each one I'd stop trying. 1st time can consider it bad timing, second could be a fluke, third time though, they most likely aren't interested. If they are then they have to come to me at that point. I'd just stay friendly and accept that they want someone else to fill that part of their life. Nothing personal against me.    
Bring a frisbee. Not even kidding. I bring one for my daughter and me to play with and I'll randomly have other kids join in. Feels weird having to say this, but you don't have to get close and you get to make a lonely kid's day. Definitely lessens the "creep" factor.  
I think your ex is paranoid, then.  Goodness, may as well not even have eye contact with children. 
Be grateful the cop didn't get you on attempted bribery, too 
I hope that they didn't tell you that because they can't. It's a public park and you can sit and watch over your siblings whenever you want. Should have told them to kiss your ass, and if anyone has a problem they can come to you like an adult and not call the cops just because your a man. Sad part is I totally can see this happening and your a better person than I am because I would have fucking lost it. 
After reading this whole thread down until this comment, I really needed to hear something like that. Legitimately made me drop a manly tear of hope for a more fair and just society. 
Dont they have train carriages for women only in Japan (i remember seeing these on my visit)?  
So that's why they got the women and children off the titanic first. The men just wanted to die in peace. 
This is why I wear headphones and listen to music at the grocery store. Good luck throwing a fit at me when I can't even hear it happening! 
Next time call her out and tell her she should apply to be on one of those hoarder rehab shows. 
You may want to try and let people know you are harmless. What if you offer them some candy? 
I have been directly told that I do not blink often enough and that it made people uncomfortable. I haven't changed my blinking schedule, they will have to get over it. 
F that, I sit where I want if the train/bus is crowded, but yeah, if it's not, then I sit apart from other people.  Give others their privacy and peace at being alone 
ehh dont let it bug you, women's/ gender studies majors aren't real people. 
I have a really good female friend that I've known since the 4th grade. She is a very pretty, smart, talented girl that I've treated like a sister since day one. Never dated, kissed, hooked up, anything. Never even crossed my mind. Needless to say it was weird to introduce her to my new GF (now wife). Wife thought it was super weird and suspicious. I tried to explain to her she's like a sister to me and to not be worried. It took like 2 years for her to finally let her guard down. We still text each other every week or so and my wife doesn't care. She honestly really likes her and they became friends.  
Oh Jesus, forget it. I do a lot of power lifting, cause I like it, that's it, and I've been doing it for a while. But holy fuck, if there's a semi-attractive girl that I'm giving an *iota* of attention to, that must mean I want to fuck her. Doesn't matter her age or if she's already taken (or the fact that I'm happily taken), it *must* mean that any positive emotions that I'm displaying towards her is all a guise to get my dick wet.   Equally parts frustrating and funny.  
I used to cheat all the time on spelling tests, but then stopped because I was becoming increasingly afraid of getting caught.  The first test I took without cheating, I got super anxious and stared at anything and everything while occasionally remembering to write down a word.  The teacher thought I was cheating.  This was the kind of spelling test where the teacher would tell you the word then use it in a sentence.  He smugly worked his catching me cheating into the sentences.  I lied and said I cheated on it because I thought I'd get in more trouble for arguing.  I wasn't mad about the accusation, but the working it into the test sentences really bothered me for some reason.  I cheated on every test after that out of spite. 
Even restaurants have that advertised in the front of their buildings. 
You don't really use water for cookies, unless they were scared of how she washed her hands. 
If you aren't going to trust the test what was the point of having it done? 
Sure, but the repairs are already under way and no amount of suing anyone is going to make it faster or less expensive.  
They just dont give a shit. Poor black people really dont have a voice over there. And the people privileged enough to have the power to potentially fix it are so lost in yankee jingoism they refuse to accept there is a serious problem.  
Im pretty sure most city water pipes are made of lead. Which isnt a problem, usually.  Flint is having trouble because of the other chemicals in the water that have corroded the pipes.  Im no chemist, but i know my city has lead pipes and the waters good.  
Don't forget all the fertilizer and petroleum waste runoff. But basically, nobody gives a shit. Waste has always been dealt with this way, and nothing has changed to accommodate the vastly larger population and strain on the local ecosystem.  
The Michigan AG is a worthless fuck. He is announcing new charges in the morning but it's political maneuvering to coincide with his gubernatorial run.  
It costs a lot of money to be in perpetual war with eight different countries. 
I wish the mods would just make a rule that all threads be serious. Damn near every thread without it turns into a shit show.  
Livonia resident here. The advisory was issued only as a precautionary measure and its pretty funny how some residents have been blowing it out of proportion on Facebook. Some people are freaking out because they drank the water, or brushed their teeth. It's just a precautionary boil water alert, no bacteria has actually been detected. They finished the first round of tests that came back clean. Now they have to wait another 24 hours to conduct the second round of tests to confirm. Just waiting for results to get the all clear.  It's been very entertaining to see the drama play out amongst the residents on local social media pages.   Our family didn't find out about the water advisory until the day after they issued it. My whole family drank a lot of water that day and we were fine. We have since switched to drinking bottled water, but have been showering and brushing our teeth with tap water.  We are all still feeling well and haven't grown a third eye.  
Boiling does not remove lead or other metals, primarily used to kill pathogens. Filters vary widely in their ability to remove lead. One needs to carefully read specs before choosing one and then test filtered water to see if claims are accurate.  
Still happening, the presidential candidates milked Flint for all the political points they could and moved on, little has happened since. 
Yep. I make zero physical contact beyond shaking hands when introducing myself. I'll hug close friends but that's it. 
My sister was really into the indigo girls and ani difranco and cut her hair off and joined the rugby team. This was about 15 years ago, and she is now happily married to a man.  We were all *shocked* 
I remember in girl with the dragon tattoo when the villian says "you'll be amazed at what people do because they don't want to be rude" and I feel like half of the crap we put up with is because we want to be nice or polite.   (This was from the movie and I paraphrased I don't remember the book very well) 
I once gave a compliment to my friend on a party. I just said his shirt looked nice on him when he thought it was too small. And then all his peers went "ooooooooooooooooooh" behind him. I just really wanted to compliment my friends and I do it all the time. :( I never gave a compliment to him ever again.  
Whenever I eat a banana in public, I aggressively tear it apart with my bared teeth 
I do this too! Except I'm a 6'4 man and in reality it's just because finding pants that are long AND skinny is very difficult, I have far too few casual belts, and I don't want to literally show off my ass. 
"Omg is that a grill gamer?" "Marry me" "Suck my dick"  Every time I start talking in an Overwatch comp... 
Also... who the fuck are you random guy? Am I supposed to just trust you with my stuff?  
What I hate more is when they tell me it's just because I've NEVER HAD A REAL MAN BEFORE. JEEZ I know confidence is sexy but your dick is not magic, it cannot un-gay me tyvm. 
Yep. Last year I ran into a coworker at the supermarket, and he offered to help me out with my groceries. We get to my car, and all of a sudden I'm arguing with him for 10 minutes about why I don't want to date him.  I started off joking, then got serious; Finally I just got in the car and left.  
For the life of me, I don't understand why people are so scandalized when a bra strap shows. It's not my fucking nipple, it's a strip of cotton with a little plastic slider.   As a kid, I never gave a fuck, and as an adult, lol I still don't care. Call me trashy if you want, I don't have time to care about that shit.  
You are engaged?   Screw you b*tch for leading me own 
Hey I saw your post.   HI    hey   HOW are you   hey  
Being bigger definitely reduces a lot of what I've read here. I was a nice, friendly, not skinny but not overweight girl a few years back and i couldnt look at a bloke without being harassed.   Now I'm not-so-skinny lol but the problem has done a 180, now i cant have a conversation with a bloke at a bar because they panic thinking a fat chick is hitting on them and wont give me the time of day.    Basically i stopped trying to make friends lol  
Not just that, but you've now given a clear green light for them to now seize every opportunity possible to talk about all the feelings they've had building up over the years that they've never shared with anyone else. You become their sole emotional support system when you were just trying to be a normal friend once.  
When I was 13, my Dad told me "nobody can think with a hard on" and "an erect dick has no conscience"   which, applied to 13 year old boys, wasn't bad advice    
I totally get why you reacted in the way you did, and have experienced similar things. The way I think of it is that my brain is automatically set to a polite setting. I know how to act like a decent human being. But when I come across a creepy guy and his behavior is so unacceptable it's like.... how do I react here? I guess I'll just keep on being polite?? My brain just defaults to that.  But nowadays I'm like.... fuck that. If a guy is being rude to me I am going to be rude right back because I don't owe him my politeness. I don't owe him anything. Most of the time these sorts of creeps are giant cowards. If you loudly confront them they'll usually back off. And if you're in a public setting, you have even more security, because strangers will make the guy back off and will be on your side if the guy has the dumbass idea to escalate. Slowly, I've retrained my reactions, and I think I'm the better for it. 
There seems to be a fairly clear pattern in those two threads: women are afraid of men, and men are afraid of scaring women. 
I always feel weird walking my dog (5lb silver/grey Chihuahua).  I will hear women/girls squee while driving by, or I get stopped a lot because of the dog.  I know full well they want to pet/interact with my dog, but that part of my biology is like, dude, they are standing right there, hit on them. I'm not trying to condone men always acting on that impulse, but it's there, and if you don't do a lot of introspection, you may not see it as wrong or that it makes people uncomfortable.  I'm usually pretty good about trying to be super neutral and just talking about the dog and not really about myself or the lady. I mean, my pupper is the fucking shit, she deserves all the attention, and I love dog people, so I don't want to creep any out. 
I literally could have written this post. I always loved having friends of both genders throughout my childhood and even some of my adolescence (it helped that I was a bit of an ugly duckling), but the older (and more attractive?) I got, the more complicated things became. I really hate having to be so cold to most men, but it's just the path of least resistance socially. :/  
Plot twist, both genders are gay when regarding bananas... 
Guys are dickheads. Was out with my gf one night. I moved away to light a smoke, and two guys came up and started hitting on her and her friend. She goes "no thanks, my bf is over there".   Next thing I know they are trying to fight *me* cause my gf told them she wasn't interested!  
Yay! I am so happy to hear not all women are terrified to be nice to men or dress however they want. I am the same way, but it took most of my 20s to get to this point...  
I assure you, there are plenty of women out there who do not have explicitly feminine interests.  
To be fair, a guy will have the same problem if they have an itch in the lower regions.  
I was friends with a girl, she'd had one boyfriend from the time she was 17 to 24 (when I met her). I could kind of tell she was a bit naive when it came to acting around male friends. I wasn't silly about it, she had a partner and I was so grateful for the support she offered me. During a super stressful time she was there to ask me how I was doing and offer support. Even just the 'Morning!' texts were such a ray of sunshine.      I can imagine stuff like that being misinterpreted as advances or whatever. But I was just happy to have a friend who cared during that time. Honestly, I did struggle with feeling for her, but I knew damn well that wasn't the appropriate course of action and it wasn't her fault either. But I valued her friendship way too much to do something so stupid like pursue her.  
I think your first male friend was off his rocker if he invited people to a house with a three week old baby to party.  The pillow thing is just weird though. 
My Uncle lives in Dingle, and I think this is the first time I've seen it mentioned outside my family. Lovely little place. 
This comment made me realize that, for some reason, it is easier to say berrydingle than dingleberry quickly.  
"Oh hey it's you! The guy with the dingleberries right?" 
Hangman was my first thought, too.  I'd probably just play it with my family though, I have elementary aged boys.  I'd be set for life very quickly. 
Hell, you could even sell your services for a fraction of any other photographer. People would be suspicious, but of course there'd be people out there that just want a cheap photographer for their wedding, so they give you a shot. With the millions you wind up making, you can get the absolute best equipment, take classes and courses to improve your techniques, and even hire professional photo editors.   Soon, you'll be one of the most wanted photographers around, and you'll just have that one quirk that people comment on (the dingleberry thing), but the end result is so good, that they just don't care. Eventually, you can have an impressive enough portfolio that even if people figure out why you have them say dingleberry (which I assume makes the money stop coming in), you could just raise your prices to reflect your new skill set. 
I can't believe I had to scroll to the bottom of this post to find the simplest and most logical answer.  
How are you going to work dingleberry into a convo?  
How about if you can't use the actual word you want them to say? 
-Acrudes massive amounts of money -Buys business -Eliminates source of income for the business and for how the massive amounts of money was made 
At least it's a better plan to scam money than faking cancer  YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Your other problem would be that you'd have millions but you'd have to hide it because you need him to call you dingleberry every so much time so you can't even quit.  
The thought of a Family Feud audience saying "dingleberry" just made me crack up in the break room.  
"It's the same guy. Sixth time this week. Look at his account too. Something's not right here." 
There's actually a YouTuber who calls his audience Dingleberries.  
I don't under and your second one. So you show them your hairy asshole with the word "dingleberry" on it, and the respond with "Oh, heavens! Dingleberry!?" 
I just tried it, it's a lot harder than you would think. 
I'd say that the chances of actually being able to spell that in Scrabble are incredibly low. But ok.  
I just realized this is what's going on. We've all been fools.  
Actually, this was my answer. I figured I'd just ask my least mature coworkers to wash my dogs, and I wouldn't do their sanitary shaves beforehand.  
This is where my main use of dingleberry comes from, also upvote for ass fluff.  
I think you'd have more luck playing subtle. They have to think you HATE that nickname, and you have to try and act like you're playing it cool, which should be easy since you make bank each time. 
I feel like you can offer way less and get the same results. 
Bonus: wear those shirts when you volunteer as a coach at a middle school.  12 year old boys will run around calling you "dingleberry" like it's the world's best joke 
Step 2: Post the word "Dingleberry" and send.   Step 3. Turn on the news.   Step 4: Profit. 
Did you vanish after the cloth wrapped around you? 
That is when you look dumbfounded and shocked at the audience ala Steve Harvey. Wait for the laughs to die down and then ask if there is anyone in the audience you can call Katie. 
Even if not magic, that's still an impressive memory  
That's when you start screaming 'WHERE'D MY HAND GO JESUS CHRIST WHAT HAVE YOU DONE" 
I did this one time.  I was talking to a buddy at a party and there was a girl behind him.  I picked up a deck of cards and fanned them out and told him to pick a card with his mind.  I asked him if it was the ace of spades.  "Nope! Haha!" and he got up and walked away.    The girl behind him just looked astonished and asked me, "How did you do that?!"  I replied magic.  Thought it was funny she didn't catch on. 
And that's why they shouldn't let drunks participate... 
Was this in Tahoe with a magician named Alex Ramon?  Exact thing happened to me at that show.  
If you're defeated by a 9 year old, you are not a good magician. 
Something similar happened to my sister, but it was with a bouncy ball and they had *her* drop it. 
Similar story, hypnotist was hired to come to our school and brought up a group of 10 of the students onto the stage. All was going well except one of the kids began to pretend he was hypnotized and being 'forced' to taking off his own pants. Remember this is a school so The hypnotist got understandably pissed and told him to get off the stage. I swear fuckin high school kids sometimes 
If that was about 25 years ago, that was me as the kid.  I was really into making balloon animals and did what you said several times.  The best part was when they were having trouble making things without popping the balloons (usually because they over inflate) so I asked if they needed help.  They thought it would be funny to watch a kid struggle, but then I made what they were trying to do.  Usually they got pretty competitive and would ask me to make something difficult, which I did.    
"Why didn't you do it in your own purse?"  "Magic!" 
This sounds like a scene from Arrested Development with Tobias & Gob.   Tobias convinces Gob to see this new Magician in town after seeing an ad for "Tonight: Magic Mike" at some bar. The pair goes to the bar, get a table together. Tobias notes that there's pretty much only women there and Gob makes some comment about how it's pretty great.  They ask for volunteers and, of course, Gob volunteers to go up on stage. Seeing the two men seated together, the announcer doesn't ask any questions and Gob sits down, convinced that he's about to steal the show or steal a magic trick from someone only to end up getting a lap dance from a half dozen ripped, sweaty men.   Close up on Gob's face as he says "I've made a huge mistake."  
I wonder if there's legal standing on who would get charged for assault or whatever crime is committed while under hypnosis.  The person doing the act of the hypnotist? 
She probably didn't have any qualms about storing valuables in her bra. She may have easily had trouble with the idea of flashing a crowd. Flashing a crowd is not smoking or murdering, because smoking and murdering require paraphernalia and actions that are u usual throughout your life experience as a non-smoker and non-murderer. Changing clothes is common enough to get this to work. This is exactly the kind of thing hypnotism can do to a participant who ordinarily would not. 
Have to question your memory a bit on this one. The Linking Rings is classic of magic and does not use anything that could even remotely be mistaken for "clips" of any kind.   A standard set of Linking Rings consists of 8 rings: 2 single rings, a chain of 2 rings (permanently joined), a chain of 3 rings (also permanently joined) and a "key" ring which has a gap, or break in it. Fancy sets may also include a slightly oversized ring and a slightly undersized ring. There are also "locking" key rings that can let the magician open or close the gap, but no clips. Few decent magicians bother with locking keys as they're actually harder to handle.  The illusion is created by handling the rings in specific ways which let the magician initially conceal that certain rings are permanently linked and then swapping them in and out of play. Even knowing how this is done, I have seen performances that blow me away. 
say, "great.  Let's make it even more random by adding those two digits together..."  or you can say, "Deal down 11 cards... now turn over the next card." 
Your cousin doesn't sound like a very nice person... she deliberately damaged that man's property then had no regrets? Not friendly indeed... 
The trick is being well liked enough that your audience doesn't want to expose you.   I was on stage with Penn and Teller and they did an illusion where Another audience member and I tied up Teller and put him behind a curtain. He would make things that were out of his reach move and we had to check every so often to make sure he was still tied up.  At one point I was able to see that he wasn't really tied up anymore, but I still said "Yes, he is still tied up." because why would I want to spoil their show?  I also allowed Penn to tell his wife that their kids put the ice cream in the shopping cart, even though I saw him put it in there, cuz snitches get stitches. 
I made a plant cry once by implying his twin brother was the better showman, it was a petty thing to do but I was annoyed upon discovering that all the volunteers were plants when I ended up having to attend the same show a second time. 
"No, no, all I did was this"   *makes the card change*  "..."  *mother starts crying* 
Just don't volunteer to go up. If they try to pick you anyways shake your head out tell them no. 
I understand this however at the end of the day you need to think about yourself, you only have one life you don't want to destroy it. 
Jealous! I broke my ankle in Jan this year and once it healed I went on a hike for the first time in March/April I fell and cracked my ankle again about a mile away from my car about to go home. I can safely say I won't be enjoying any hikes soon :(  
Good on you! I really like that about myself too. My own personal motto is "do it *because* you're scared".  
I have an inability to stay mad at people for longer than like 24 hours.  Even if I want to be angry, usually once I wake up in the morning, I just can't be mad anymore. 
I am the exact same! I went to get my eyes tested last year with my fingers crossed I would get to buy some black think lenses geek glasses because I feel I really suit them  
And then it destroys your life but you're completely fine with it, until you aren't.  
I used to get thanked by parents when I worked at a bookstore, because I'd talk to the kid when he or she was looking for something to read instead of asking the parent what the kids wanted. Those were some of my proudest moments working there.  
Same. I can fall asleep anywhere, at any time. Thanks, Marine Corps. 
Congrats! Absolute well done I hope you are proud :) Anyone achieving their weight loss or health goals to me deserve a round of applause!  
Don't forget to be kind to yourself too. I hope you will have a nice day 
A ten inch cock would be detrimental in the bedroom. Larger than 6 inches starts to hit the cervix, which is very painful for the woman.  
Oh my god that is SO me, and I actually hate this. I always consider the bad in everything and treat it as a possibility and it just fucks my brain. Maybe I'm just an extreme case of what you've mentioned but like, assuming my family goes out to swim, I actually get so damn worried. Or if I meet someone new and am not sure he likes me for 100% certainty, I'll doubt every small decision I make and question the reasons behind every small thing he does.  In the end of the day, I feel very unique about this, it doesnt sound as good on paper but its just really fitting to my personality, it makes me feel unique.  Wow I'm going on full essay mode, I should stop. 
That is touching :) I'm so glad your happy and healthy! 
It sounds like such a cute personality trait too, I bet you love it.  
Seriously? Read "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Robert Glover.  Like you said, where you are is both a positive and a negative. You come first, always. 
That's great! Do you raise Charolais or Brahma? I reckon if they're good sized you probably don't raise Jerseys or Dexters. I've heard some have really good luck bringing in a Brahma bull to cross with some of the English breed cattle to get really good calves, particularly in hotter climes. 
Do you think you re more disciplined than motivated? How do u gain that motivation? 
same!! I admire you so much for becoming a therapist; I wish I could, but I don't think I'd be able to separate other people's emotions from my own in a way that would keep me psychologically healthy. you rock :) 
Same. Everyone tells me everything because they know I have no one to tell their secrets to 
If I could capture one feeling, bottle it, and sell it for $10 a hit, it would be the feeling I get when I suddenly realize that I'm reading a /u/fuckswithducks comment. 
That's great :) At least your growing into a more confident person !  
Most likely she assumed you were trying to pick her up when she was vulnerable. 
This sounds like me, with that positive kind of fuck it. I like that also! 
Is this a case of being book smart but not real world smart? 
This is me as well. It's the fastest way to distract myself from a depressive mood, just by diving into a new subject that has long piqued my interest. I have a pretty long list of bookmarked articles and podcasts that I store up for just such occasions.  
Just by reading that I started feeling low about myself. 
T Total! Good on you! Not many people can say this!  
Stay safe! You only have one life don't cut it too short 
You feel inferior or you feel everyone is inferior to you? 
Yeah will Hitler liked comics too.    **edit** So did the real hitler 
Refusing to go to Seaworld, definitely a good guy. 
I miss my ex's elementary school aged brother more than her. He was a cool little dude. 
I think there's a solid chance your dad doesn't like coffee but likes going to get coffee with you. Just saying. 
Some nerds make amazing spouses.  Im dating one and everyone in the family has offered too marry him(Jokingly) just to keep him in the family. 
The year was 1892  We don't know what became of Albert after that... 
If I met a guy like this I'd let him come across me 
Nothing is more beautiful than a mans relationship with his hot dog. 
I hope this story is true! Way to throw it back at him! 
I have never had a boyfriend who had any interest in being courteous or friendly with my siblings/their SO's/my friends before until my current one. It makes such a refreshing difference, and feels like he actually gives a shit about me and cares about my life.  
And there were condoms in the drawer under the bathroom sink? 
Also a daughter my dad said "I like the way he looks at you." This was a couple days after we got married. But that's how I knew I didn't make a mistake. 
Okay so I just met the parents of my girlfriend last Thursday and I spoke to them a little bit. It was a little awkward for the three of us (the parents and me) but we had a little bit of small talk while I we were helping ing pack my gfs things. This isn't bad right?  Thank you everyone for the help you're all too kind :) 
I've had a crush on Link since 1999.  It's probably been good for me, because the characteristics I imagined Link to have (hard working, patient, kind, etc) were all great qualities to pursue in young men. My husband is my Link. I am well loved by the kindest, most patient, and hard working man I've ever met.  
Man I hate that my daughter, 6 years old, is getting attention from boys already. One of the boys on her soccer team gave her a plastic rose and it made me realize all three of my girls are going to have boys chasing them like dogs. The boy that gave her the rose is a nice and sweet little boy but i just want to tell him to back the fuck off. I think I'm ok for now though, she's a bit of a tomboy and doesn't have interest in boys yet.  
Wish I had an office, how do I get one of these neckbeard losers? 
Care to enlighten those redditors who aren't meta enough? Asking for a friend  
Need to be careful with that. It needs to be understood that it is mostly an affectionate joke or it could cause some serious social and relationship issues for her down the road.  I have a sibling who ONLY dates a demographic that my dad dislikes and she's admitted that it's partly because of the whole 'don't date till college' and to spite him for doing the whole 'princess' thing to her. She hates that with a passion. 
That's a bit too far for burning a 4 year old alive. Probably like give him a scare telling the kid He's gonna be a daddy. 
I actually met my boyfriend online and now I live with him. My mom was very harsh about me dating someone long distance that I had never met in person. But since I moved in with him and he drove me across the country to visit my family, she seems to be pretty fond of him. My grandma wouldn't talk to him though.   I'm glad you're okay with your daughter having long distance relationships. The way my mom acted was pretty upsetting to me. 
Oh, like presenting yourself as an acceptable human being ? Who would've thought. 
If I took a salad when I first met my now in-laws, my father-in-law would have laughed me out of the house.   My mother-in-law would have also been offended if I brought something along as I was invited to their house for dinner as their guest, her thought process would have been 'is my food not good enough?'  I think once you know them it is fine but bringing things the first few times you meet them is well overboard. 
I love this. And can relate completely.   Congratulations to you! It's hard to rebuild, but can be so worth it. 
Shit man, I'm on the same chapter but it's chapter 26 in my book. Mundane career, sex has decreased drastically, and just smile at the neighbors. Does it get any better towards 30? 
Me: I want a girlfriend  Also me: *makes no effort to find one* 
When you're a granny you should have a chapter called Sewing. 
You too huh. Welcome to my life. Wife passed away from cancer in February. 
I'm 23 as well and I totally feel you on this, but just know you're not alone, buddy. 
No no no.  You've set yourself up pretty well. Go ahead and try. Worst case scenario you try again, maybe a different way. Don't let your brain talk you out of it. Brains are dumb and lazy. They don't want to put in the effort. You know better. Go pick up something heavy please.  
Trying to hard may be the problem.  I gave up on dating for like 3 years and out of nowhere I met and am with probably the most amazing and best match for me.  Never stop looking but dont make it a must have.  
I know parents that still has full control of all of their kids' income. 'kids' as in mid 20s adults with full salary incomes. My friend still has to ask his mom if he can go replace his iPhone 4 for a new one with his own money  
I knew a guy in the Navy who brought his new wife overseas to his duty station to be with him. She wanted to stay behind and finish college but he wanted her nearby so he could "keep an eye" on her. When she arrived she was specifically prohibited from interacting with Navy wives. He got a place off base so she wouldn't bump into anyone who was American.  Then he insisted on doing all of the shopping with her. She had to stay in their apartment, with no internet, waiting for him to come home (dinner was expected upon his arrival).   When he told me about all of the restrictions he placed on her I was resolved to go to fleet family services about it if it didn't resolve in a month (lots of folks came overseas with weird notions of how they would live only to dramatically change course soon after). Fortunately she left his weird ass a few weeks later. 
My father did this to my mother. He controlled the money. Even though she worked all day taking care of their five children, he made her do extra tasks like wash the cars or do some random unnecessary thing before he would give her money for our groceries. It was never enough money to feed us all easily. My mom had to coupon and deal shop like a pro. At the time, I thought we were terribly poor and my father was an asshole. Now I know he was just an asshole. He's gotten less controlling as time has passed/my mom has gotten more of a backbone. However, I am definitely affected by the emotional abuse and control he had over the family.  
Having a mother who does this is a living hell.  None of my career interests and hobbies feel important when all she does is to downtalk me all my life about them. Grew up with a major sense of inadequacy and I don't think I'll ever shake this off for the rest of my life.  Having excessively narcissistic mothers can beat you down 
My ex used to do this.  Bonus points if he knew I needed to pee, he would start finding every pot hole and bump in the road. 
I find the way Jerry is treated on Parks & Rec really upsetting for this reason. 
I hated being friends with someone because my parents needed their full name, phone number, if there was an adult supervising us, said adult's number, where I was going, and when I was gonna be home. Some friends understood, others thought it was super weird when I thought it was normal up until I got more friends but couldn't hang out with them. 
Yeah at 14 I was allowed to decide which of my divorced parents I wanted to live with. I chose to stick with the status quo (switching between them every week) even though my dad was emotionally abusing me and I wanted to live with my mom. I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings even with the abuse and neglect. Children love their parents and will rarely express their true feelings when asked to choose between them. 
My step grandfather did this to his wife too. He did it to hide the fact that he was 80 with a 20 year old daughter that he had with his mistress that was half his age. He had been paying their bills for years behind his wife's back. His wife was the sweetest lady you had ever met and super talented. It was really sad that everyone knew but her.   When he passed away my stepfather had to take care of her (his grandmother) and her bills because no one else wanted to help her. He's a great guy and very sweet as well. 
My father in law did this with my husband while we were dating. He went to do it one night and I used my mother voice and said, "this is completely unacceptable and you will stop it right now. He needs his sleep." Truly thought he was going to hit me for it, but he took his drunk ass back to his own house and didn't speak to me for like three months. He doesn't pull that shit much now. 
Management does this too as a subtle form of workplace bullying. Employees who can't trust their own work or decisions become easier to push around. 
i'd say pay me or I won't do it if not report his dumb arse to HR 
Isn't that a felony? You can get close to 10 years in Illinois for that, I can't speak for other states though. 
I work at a public library, and we regularly have a group of semi-independent adults come in. They are well enough to live on their own, but still need assistance with a lot of things. Some of the people in charge are *awful.* There's one lady in particular who is so controlling and rude and mean to these people. She was temporarily banned for spitting on a library staff member (me) in an argument, because I was allowing one of the adults to follow library set guidelines, not her guidelines, as her's were arbitrary and the adult in question was capable of understanding that he was in charge of the material. But she came back this week and is just as terrible as ever. 
My mom has been ill and in chronic pain for over half my life.   My ex-boyfriend used to tell me that my mother was still sick because I didn't have enough faith in God. It wasn't until I told someone else about it months after that comment that I knew that spiritual abuse was a thing. Granted, this is a much milder form of spiritual abuse. 
Okay, so me and an ex have been discussing this lately. We're still friends, but we dated and had sex for a while. She thinks that if a future boyfriend/girlfriend for me or her would have an issue with us hanging out, that's on them and not our issue. I actually feel that it's not entirely unreasonable not to want your current girl/boyfriend to have a lot of 1 on 1 time with their ex. I see it from both sides but I'd definitely have an issue with that. If it's group contexts because of mutual friends it's one thing, but 1 on 1 I'd have genuine issues with. 
Love bombing as a means of control. It wasn't about her wanting you to have nice new furniture, it was about how she looked buying you the nice new furniture. Hence the reason she still holds it over your head today. I have faith that people like that get found out in one way or another, eventually.  
I think a YouTuber got his kids taken away recently over this.  
A girl I know was emotionally abused by her girlfriend for years. In the end the abuse became physical. The manipulation went so deep that after she got out, she had herself psychiatrically evaluated because she was genuinely worried she was a "narcissistic, manipulative bitch" like her ex said she was (She wasn't, she's one of the nicest and supportive people I know)  She's in grad school now and is part of a much healthier relationship.  
Id rather have physical abuse sometimes than verbal. Some people can be... creative, in their insults. 
My grandmother once tried to force me to show off my full length chest scar to a friend of hers. I didn't want to and she went fucking batshit on me about embarrassing her in front of him.  Like I wasn't embarrassed enough about being cut open, having to undo a shirt and flash this mother fucker in the middle of an amusement park.  I was like 13 and had just started developing. 
Yes, this was the story of my life for several years. My (then) husband has an impressive salary but I had to beg him for change to take the bus.   I stayed with him for much longer than I wanted to because I couldn't afford to leave.  
Mmm I think the acceptable form of "tough love" is when you're being honest and accepting a situation. A lot of the time we try to hide or deny any problems when deeper down we know what is wrong/right.  
Nothing makes me more wary of a person who "jokes" about harming animals.   And to a lesser extend, I am wary of people who are apathetic of the suffering of animals. If they don't care if an animal is suffering, I don't want to know how they are with people. 
Yes!  I was abused emotionally and seems like people are under the impression since they put  a roof over my head and fed me I wasn't abused and I was just acting like a spoiled brat. 
On the flip side in family law cases I've seen parents point blank deny their child has an issue (even though the other parent, school teachers, mental health specialists all see the symptoms and agree). Denying access to the medication is just as harmful as overprescribing  
I get "talked to" at work a lot about allowing potty breaks. I tell the boss point blank, I will never, ever deny anyone the use of the toilet.   I might offer to set up a visit with the school nurse if it gets excessive though.  
am a woman, and mostly have guy friends. with my girl friends we discuss red flags and what not, and there is a general understanding of what is abusive behavior. With my guy friends I was really surprised on how many red flags just flew over their heads.   
I'm bi and my ex straight up didn't want me to have friends.  
Dude in some cases, emotional abuse fucks you up more than physical abuse. You mentioned the "if you break up with me i'll kill myself" and that could not be more true. In highschool i heard this shit constantly because no one understands the mental strain and confusion that sort of threat puts on someone. yes, it's a threat and should be treated as one. i break up with this person, they kill themselves because of it and now what? all i would think about is it's my fault that person lost their life and that could end up with you ending your own life. such a horrible thing to say to someone that's about to end the relationship in all honesty.  
I had always felt stupid growing up.  It was the early 90's and in my area there was no real talk of learning disabilities.  I just got scolded from teachers about how I didn't "apply myself".  It improved slightly in high school (still got shit grades) and then I went to college because that's what you're supposed to do, right?  As my college years went on, I improved from being a lackluster student to pretty good upon graduation.  And then, when I went into "the real world" (you know, the one your parents told you would eat you alive, etc.) I started doing pretty good, and my managers would compliment my work and abilities.  But even to this day, when I get a work compliment I think they're bullshitting me and I think I am absolutely horrible at my job because of how many years I spent hearing how much I sucked in school.   
I feel good most of the time, working out, socializing, enjoying my cigarette and my walk. I feel confident. But it wasn't always like that, so when a day or two come when I feel down, I always fear that it will spiral down and that I will end where I was few years ago. That makes me even more sad. But it didn't spiral down so far. 
I feel this as well. Wife's dad was dying over a few days and I was focused on the logistics not the emotions, which came later. But I felt like a sociopath not caring in the moment about it.  
It's so terrifying when the one thing that you think you can always count on being consistent (yourself and your thoughts) becomes out of your control.  
I remember on one of those Askreddit "what secret could you never tell anyone?" posts someone talked about how they had a few drinks with the mother of an autistic child one night, and she started talking about how the kid had pretty much ruined her entire life. All her time had been devoted to this child, who, even when he moved out, still had to be taken care of by his parents almost 24/7. She finished it off with saying she wishes he'd just die already.  It was fucking heartbreaking.  
I feel the "call of the void" in social situations, which is interesting because I have pretty intense social anxiety, and so some social situations can feel like life or death to me. I occasionally get the urge to do super weird things in public. Like if I'm in a crowded place, I think about jumping up on a table and screaming and ripping my clothes off. Or if I'm in an elevator, I think about screaming. 
Never thought of it in that way but "meta worry" seems to sum up a concept that I've been trying to verbalize for a while. 
I have diagnosed OCD, and I often get thoughts or images that I hate so much it makes my entire body wretch/crumple.  It's like hating the thoughts so much makes them happen more often.  Totes sucks breh  
As long as you aren't hearing them reply, then it's normal. Everyone talks to themself occasionally.  
Right.  There are enormously profitable industries devoted to making people feel badly about themselves.  One time I saw an ad for some cosmetology service.  The "real customer" was a mom who wanted acceptance from her children because they were supposedly embarrassed by her (normal) appearance.  I hope this isn't something which people are actually insecure about because that sounds really sad. 
It's called perfectionism. If you can handle the stress and misery it can throw at you, you can soar to heights and successes those around you couldn't even imagine. You just need to deal with the fear of failure and constant belief of its not enough. Find the balance and you can do amazing things.  
I do the same thing! I do it as a coping technique to deal with anxiety.  
what if as a kid I had really low self esteem and thought there was no way anyone could actually like me so all my friends were just pretending to so i didnt feel bad. 
I know what you mean.    I am an alcoholic in recovery, and establishing myself in a community of like-minded people was critical in my recovery. If I had continued to surround myself exclusively with the people I knew in my active drinking, then nothing would have changed.    I am a big fan of 12-Step programs, as well as support groups and online communities for whatever problems seem to arise.    This allows people to go from "People around me mean well, but nobody understands" to "These guys get it! They're just like me".    But making newer, healthier relationships is easy to say, and hard to do. At least with support groups, there's a common bond, and a context for interaction where people can practice these skills. 
I assume most people just think of intelligence in a way that benefits them. For example, a person who is good at math will take that as evidence of his above average intelligence, while someone else might talk about how he's good at making life decisions, etc. 
I hope you're both holding up okay. I wish I had something more constructive to say than that. Just know that an internet stranger is thinking of you both and wishing you the best in this hard time.  
People just don't understand senses in general and that there are more than five. Thanks, Platobama. 
Again, not a psychologist, but I've been told that it's the way you respond to intrusive thoughts that determines whether or not you have a problem. A "normal" person might have an intrusive violent thought and just sort of think, whoa, that was a weird thought, and never think any more of it. Someone with OCD could have the same violent intrusive thought and spend ages worrying what it means about them as a person, worry that they are dangerous and a future murderer, take precautions to prevent becoming a murderer (e.g. avoid contact with people, avoid touching knives, etc). I was told that people with OCD tend to place too much significance on their intrusive thoughts, and struggle to understand that thinking a horrible thought does not mean they will then act on that thought. I hope this makes some sense - I saw an OCD specialist a while back and am trying to paraphrase what they told me. 
Not the same but similar.   Without going in to detail I had a moderately shitty childhood and now, whenever I'm not distracting myself with something too stimulating to prevent it, I get intense flashbacks to negative events. It can be a different one each time, or the same one repeatedly for a week.   Like you said it's just like being there again, particularly emotionally, and afterwards I'm left upset at having to deal with it and angry that something relatively trivial and from so long ago can affect me so much today, and a bad one can really throw my day out. It's been happening for ~10 years now and is slowly getting worse each year.  So long story short, idk if it's normal, but you're not alone and I hope things get better for you. 
one of the comments say that imposter syndrome isnt as common as everyone thinks and now you're saying the exact opposite. who do i believe lol 
As a kid i believed that if i just wish for something hard enough, like turning time backwards so i can do my test again or so, i would wake up the next morning and it would have happend... shitty kid's movies brought me to these assumptions and life smacked them out of me 
"Can you say the alphabet backwards?"  "teb ah pla" 
This is the stupid shit I would say and be haunted by forever. 
Funny aside, the MR2 is named diferently in France, 'cause MR2 sounds like "it's shitty" in french. Toyota "est merdeux"... 
"wow your job is cleaning police uniforms? Such a niche!"  
Have a friend who had a bike that actually got ticketed for not wearing a seatbelt while riding. He of course fought the ticket in court and it was dismissed.  Asshole cop just wanted to waste my friend's time I guess.   
Cop: Were you drinking a coke whilst driving?  Me: Can't I drink and drive?  Cop: Erm...definately not  Me: But I could smoke?  Cop: Yes.  Me: Then I was smoking some coke.  Cop: Please step out of the car Sir. 
When I was there, they were all wearing deinm as a form of labor protest.  At first, I just thought Canadian cops wore denim. 
Thats a trick they use, if you laugh you probably don't have anything to hide, but if you say no sternly then they'd probably search the car 
Either you follow rules 1 and 2. Or you are ugly and he felt sorry for you. 
I said something similar to a doctor before he put staples in my head. He did not let me off with a warning. 
Haha...Once, i got pulled over for passing some guy that was going 35 in a 55. I sped past him and went about 65 mph, but I guess I was close to him and I ended up crossing the fog lines...  anyways, guy pulls me over and as soon as he sees my last name, he asks "Are you X's son?" and I answer "yeah". (my dad was a firefighter and knows a bunch of cops, etc)  and he says he'll let me off with a warning, but he is definitely gonna tell my dad about my reckless driving.   He never said anything to my dad but I really don't think I was reckless. Oh well.  
I'm sorry officer I didn't know I couldn't do that.  
Yeah, TSA customs are stupidly anal.   When I was 13 and coming back from a vacation in England, I had some guy completely flip shit screaming at me because I dared to pull my old ass iPod out of my pocket for about 2 seconds to check the time, not realizing that was a problem. I got bitched at by some grouchy middle aged dude and he went on for a solid minute over it.   Like, is that *really* necessary to flip shit on some kid over something so stupid? Just say "Hey, that's not allowed put it away" 
Yeah don't ever swear in front of a cop. They'll travel through heaven and hell to make sure every expletive you say gets on the report. 
The only way you can get arrested for drugs at a festival is if they catch you selling hard drugs in front of them. If they were to arrest everyone who had taken something at a festival there would be no festival.  
He laughed *and then* smiled? How did he laugh without smiling? 
I'm sorry - four cops had to warn you for jaywalking? Were you carying a flame thrower or something? 
I honestly dont understand the rules with public intoxication.. I feel like you shouldn't be punishable unless youre actually disrupting people, but what do i know. 
This reminds me of a story I read on a similar thread a year or two ago. A college costume party got shut down by the cops, but one guy dressed as Captain Sparrow was able to get to the edge of the balcony on the second floor. As the cops surrounded him, he drunkenly shouted, "Gentlemen, you will always remember this day as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!"  He broke both legs on impact and got his minor in possession.  
My husband was pulled over in high school one night on his way home from work.  "Son, you didn't use your blinker."  "Uhm...my blinker is still on. Is my light out?"   "Don't be a smartass! Where are you coming from?"   *looks down at his Sonic uniform* "Work..."  "And where are you going this time of night?"  "Home. That driveway right there. That's my dad like....right there."   "What's in the backseat? DON'T MAKE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS. WHAT. IS IN. THE BACKSEAT?!"  "I don't fucking know by fucking memory, my girlfriend keeps shit back there, i keep shit back there. What specifically are you asking about?"  "The briefcase!"  ".....that's a CD wallet. Look, i have to piss, i'm pulling into my driveway now. My license is right here, you can write me a damn ticket but i'm going to go take a leak."   He got back out, no ticket, and the cop had left.  
Thanks to you, I will now forever carry a copy of the emancipation proclamation in a brown paper bag in my pocket. Thank you for this. :) 
Our tax dollars at work in the most productive way! :D 
At first I was confused, then I remembered Murica and their wacky drinking laws 
I've been in the car when a friend has gotten pulled over, it was night and the cop got really close to the back of his car and turned his brights on (probably to read his license plate/registration sticker) and my friend switches lanes in the hopes the cop was trying to pass him.  When the cop switched lanes too, you could see it in his face he knew he was fucked. 
Same thing in France, you're not allowed to put anything in your ears, unless medical prescribed (hearing aid) or while taking your motorcycle practice exam (getting directions).  Apparently, it distract you, but you can still blast music from your car's speaker or put speakers in your helmet.  Who knows why then.  Got arrested but they probably didn't know it was forbidden. 
You can still call 911 and tell them it's not an emergency. 
Riced out Honda civics must be pretty quick in his books then 
lmao he actually took you up on your offer? hilarious 
Sounds pretty similar to my story. I was 17 at the time.   **Cop: you know how fast you were going?**  **Me: about 70? (55MPH zone)**  **Cop: close enough. Do you know the speed limit down this road?**  **Me: ...you pulled me over, so it's obviously not 70.**  I thought it was funny. Him, not so much. He still only gave me a ticket for 9 over, instead of 15, so that was nice.    
Are you telling me you didn't walk up to him and ask "Do you know why I pulled you over?" 
"Where are you coming from?"  "Definitely not a bank robbery sir." 
The correct response would've been, "I always let my bitches light  my cigarettes." 
Lmao you never have the right of way turning right on red. Like I know you can but you have to yield to literally any other traffic, that cop is a moron. 
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Smartass the Wise? 
That's ridiculous. In Ontario you're legally required to move over when a police officer has someone pulled over on the side of the road, and oftentimes people will move over for *any* car on the side of the road to give them room.  
That's where you keep your right to a speedy trial? 
I was caught with a half oz. on Christmas Eve going through a roadblock once..   Cop said, "Good thing Santa's in a good mood"  Let me keep my weed and sent me on my way.  P.S. I'm Canadian 
Be carefull, you don't need to be caught by a radar or lidar to face a speeding ticket.  It becomes a your word vs the cops word in court and since the cop works the traffic department he is also considered an expert in the field.  Cop says to judge he was driving faster then 55, big chance judge takes his side over yours. 
Fuck, was it that bad your child didn't want to see him? It is a shame when kids cant voice their opinion 
I've used this one before. Cop grabbed my junk. Was more a caress than a frisk. I didn't get a ticket, but I left a little confused. I was seventeen. 
This one was really good, but who is the original quote attributed to? I refuse to google it   
"Our words are backed by nuclear weapons!" -Thankfully not Hitler 
This was kind of his real philosophy...he couldn't stand the idea of the Nazi party making mistakes, so anything "bad" that happened he found a way to pretend it was on purpose or positive. 
"If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best." 
Yeah, it's not that good a quote coming from mother Theresa either... Considering she was in it to convert people not to save them. 
GIMME FUE GIMME FAI GIMME DAWAJADAZA  -Adolf Hitler 
He is full of good, positive, badass quotes. He was quite the speaker.   That was kinda the problem. 
'I'm not a serial killer dad, I'm an assassin! Well the difference is one's a job and the others mental sickness!' 
"if I were your wife I'd poison your tea"  "if you were my wife I'd drink it"  Hey, you're right! 
I'm pretty sure it's Abrahoff Linkler... but i'm wrong. Just looked it up. 
I mean, she *did* have an affair with a German officer and involve herself with the Nazi war machine... 
This entire setup sounds like the start of a really good horror story. 
How *sweet* and honorable it is to die for one's country.   
I wanted to confess my love for someone on a drunk night, but I didn't want to be direct, so I posted it on My Story on Snapchat.   Hangover me wanted to kill himself.  
Well....she kinda had a point.  I mean, if someone stabs someone in your honor, etiquette requires a thank you. Even if it is just to stop yourself from getting stabbed. 
I've had a girl do this  - except her kissing face was one of the cutest things I've ever seen  - and her lips may have been the softest and best shaped I've ever felt  So instead of being the worst kiss, it was a top 10 for best pecks ever 
Haha this reminds me of me and my now husband, who out of nerves actually *backed away* from me when I leaned in for a kiss on our third date. It was his first kiss, luckily I was aware of that and knew it was just nerves. Had to do the soft "wait..", just like you! 
That was a big thing on MSN messenger too. Wanna video chat? Not really as you will know my 'lols' aren't genuine because you aren't very funny 
A girl I dated in high school kept up a box with all the poems and flowers I gave her, some photos. Etc. We reconnected a few times after college, but it was always short-lived. She got married, and her husband does not like me at all. Eventually, she started being really rude to me as well. We lost touch, even though I tried to patch things up in a friendly way. One day, I was visiting my hometown, and a very nice teenager stops me in the street and asked me my first name. Then she tells me she is my ex high school girlfriend's daughter, and that her mom still has the box, and that sometimes, when she has had a few glasses of wine, she gets the box out and she reads the poems with her daughter.  
Yeah... You don't preface a first date proposal with "I love you".  
This isn't even embarrassing, just plain psycho! What happened?  
Hah a friend of mine in the miltary's wife wanted to name their kid after me too. Felt pretty honored...pretty sure she wasn't hitting on me. He won some bet though and got to pick the name...Logan Tiberius Lastname...named his kid after Wolverine and Captain Kirk's dad. 
That's a huge red flag. She's basically already telling you not to date her, or she'll drop you for someone else as soon as she loses interest. 
The public confession is really sneaky. It's like blackmail. 
This reminded me of this one time in elementary school when my friends pressured me into "dating" a boy who lived on my street, while on the school bus together.  We got off at our stop, he tried to hold my hand, and I ran to my neighbor's house and made him chase the boy off.  Last I heard, he dated a friend's sister and put revenge porn of her online. I had a moment where I wondered if I was the one to make him so hateful towards women. 
I can almost relate. Had a "girlfriend" in middle school who would say cryptic shit and then respond with "Dont worry about it" when questioned 
Are you sure that wasn't his plan? You did stay even longer because if it. 
That...is... kind of creepy... Did you break up with her? Imagine if you were also part of the tattoo 
...and that's why you don't put all your points in INT while keeping perception at 0. 
I am so intrigued as to who it is...but oh god so much cringe  
Did you have to circle it or did he have to just assume . 
Honesty is always the best policy. It's attractive. If it were me, I'd have just shit my pants.  
Freaky! When I first met my wife she walked over to me, said hi and started to sit down next to me, farted, laughed, got up and walked away.   Later I tracked her down and introduced myself and apologized if I smelled like toot because of this "crazy" girl earlier. 
Heh, I had a friend that was a bartender and she dated a biker guy. She didn't like him because of the bike, she actually hated it. Well, anyways, one of her regulars at the bar was very obviously enamored with her, but he was quiet and I think a little slow. Well, he saw her boyfriend, and came back the next night with a cheap leather jacket, holey jeans, and a wallet chain (before he was a khakis and polo kind of guy). She asked for his drink order and he started explaining that he bought the leather jacket because he was getting a motorcycle soon. We could tell he was building up to ask her if she wanted to go out, so she interrupted him and asked what he wanted to drink more sternly. He told her, she walked off, got his drink, set it in front of him, and walked away again. The other bartender then served that guy about 3 more beers, all of which he drank in complete silence before just leaving. I never saw or heard anything about him after that. 
What the fuck???? The first one was pretty funny but the second one... Ouch 
Wow. What you did wasn't even "embarrassing," that's pretty damn reasonable. At least everyone got a first-class education in dickery that day (I'm hoping at least SOMEONE said something. If not, then I'll say it: what a bitch- and yes, if the genders were reversed I'd still call that person a bitch). 
I'm glad you were proud of him, but that part made me actually laugh out loud. 
See, that was the first mistake... you always buy the plunger first. Why? Because when you need a plunger, you need a plunger ***NOW***.   The same logic could also apply to toilet paper, antidiarrheals, etc. as well I suppose... just buy all that crap in advance or you're gonna have a really shitty time 
This. This just. God. Like, I just don't know anymore.  Everyday we stray further from the light. 
I dated a girl (ok it was FWB) that told me her biggest turn off ever was guys burping, but farting was fine.  "If you need to burp just fart instead".  I tried to explain that that's not how the gastrointestinal system works.  
Well he sounds like the very best, like no-one ever was... 
Prithee and forsoothe   Meyst thinks thoust is couthe.    I loveth you from crown to foot.   Thyst has a most rocking butt....       Take that sprog. 
Same. Mine's having a rough day at work. I better get dinner on the table before she walks in. 
I don't think a dude's nipple popping out isn't that embarrassing, reverse the situation tho... 
So many questions. How close were you to this babysitter to have a rapport with the daughter? How old were you? How old was she?  
Ask your friends to get a copy of that song and finish the song with him, using his name and any pronouns to invert the names and pronouns he's using. Switching up the roles in the song, is basically what I'm trying to say. It probably make his day.

Oh God, NYE. Senior year of college we celebrated up at school. I was taking a class over the break, so some people were there, and some made the drive up. I was both stoned and drunk by the time midnight rolled around, and was just chilling on the couch. A girl who knew the same people I did that was at the house we were at just walks over, sits next to me, and tries to initiate a NYE make out. I'm far from sober, but was in no way attracted to her, so I just turned my head when she went in for it. She spent the rest of the night crying in someone's room being comforted by her friends.  
I would have melted. Im a huge fan of Friends and have begged my husband to get lobster tattoos  
He was hedging his bets. If you had rejected him, he would have sent you "Slowly lowers hand".

Try not to confuse her by saying things like Kingdom of Brittany, Kingdom of Burgundy, or Kingdom of Toulouse. 
I remember reading about an experiment that proved his theory wrong. It was performed in the 1800's. 
Goddamn, that is some straight up ancient greek philosophy  
Eh, I thinks it was a dumb way of asking if they were scavengers, without knowing she just implied that there were cars... still very funny though  
I love the implication that this girl does this kind of thing all the time 
I'm going to guess that your response was similar to your username?

I knew a girl in college who didn't know beef came from cows. Thought there was an animal called a Beef.  
I bet someone used that as a jokey excuse to drink some more, like a "lol better finish this up because day old alcohol is gross" and he didn't catch that it was a joke and now it's in his heart forever.  
I think what she meant is that you are slightly taller in the morning, and throughout the day gravity brings you down ever so slightly. 
Maybe not physically, but water has evolved emotionally since starting therapy 2 billion years ago.

I had the following conversation with someone...  Me: [something I can't remember that referenced a person being Chinese.]  Her: You're not supposed to say Chinese, you have to say Asian.  Me: ha ha, right.  Her: No, really.  Me: (oh shit, she's serious) Well, you shouldn't just call all Asian people Chinese, but if someone is actually Chinese or Chinese-American it's fine to say that.  Her: But you're not supposed to say Chinese, you have to say Asian.  Me: Ok, but there's nothing wrong with calling a Chinese person Chinese, the problem is when people just automatically call any Asian person Chinese. It's better to say Asian if you don't know.  Her: But you're not supposed say Chinese.  
I know someone who thought this and she said it was because on the map they always made it look like it was right next to Hawaii in a little island.   You know how they usually put it in a little box and put it next to the United States just to show that it is a US state? She thought that's where it actually was

Wow, and half the time I don't wear sunscreen outside or gloves in the lab. 
To be fair to the second one, nobody pays attention to the greeting. I used to answer the phone with something like "good morning this is [name of the store] how can i help you." And I regularly got "is this [name of the store]?" 
For some reason it reminded me of the joke about the three old men.  Man 1 - "it's windy today"  Man 2 - "it's thursday"  Man 3 - "well let's get a drink"

Reminds me of one of my favorite stupid answers. As we were starting to read Hamlet, the teacher explained that at the beginning Horatio is talking to two sentries. She stops and asks, "Does everyone know what a sentry is?" To which one student replies, "Yeah, it's like, ten years." 
Mother fucker. That irritates me. It's like that guy who was really glad Obamacare was on the outs because it was shitty, but he was going to be ok because he had insurance under the ACA.

Holy shit, that makes my blood boil. Especially knowing that every girl I've slept with has probably regretted it the next morning.  
If it gets farted out into the vag somehow then it's not inconceivable  
Technically this statement is true though. Gay children will be born if a young girl sleeps with an older man. Also if not. 
To the very last point, I believe Vin Diesel himself dubbed "I am Groot" for all the various languages the original GotG came out in. Not exactly the industry standard though...

I like this one because it isn't so dirty that I can't tell it to almost anybody. 
This was the first one that I hadn't seen before and actually made me laugh. 
Interestingly, this is why Mother Superior had the bicycle seats put back on. 
My god, that was funny. I was laughing so hard my eyes started to tear up! 
I'm lost. Is it that the pantyhose was like wrapping around his dick and pulling her toes up every time he thrusted or something?  
I downvoted this because it wasn't a dirty joke but then I realized I was wrong. 
There once was a guy called Dave  Who dug up a hookers grave  She was mouldy as shit  And missing a tit  But think of the money he saved 
I've heard the joke be told with a slightly grosser response. He starts to rush to the bottom, and she says, "what are you doing?" to which he replies, "If I run now, I can get there while you're still warm" 
It's one of those jokes that I KNOW I will fuck up if I ever try to tell. 
Now I'm picturing an armless and legless girl struggling for her life while drowning. I'm not supposed to be laughing at that. 
You get it? Cuz the echo?   RIP Billy From Predator. He was scared of no man.  
Have an upvote because a coworker told me that once and made me spill my coffee. I love that joke. 
Reminds me of a joke I heard when I was younger.  Teenage son and his father are walking through the drug store when they walk past the condoms. Now these two have a good relationship so the son asks the father why condoms come in 3, 9, and 12 packs. "Well son, you see the 3 pack is for high school boys' weekends. One for Friday, one for Saturday, and one for Sunday. The 9 pack is for college boys' weekends. Three for Friday..." The son interjects, "Oh I get it! Three for Saturday and three more for Sunday." Dad smiles and nods. Then a perplexed look comes over the son's face followed by a eureka moment. "Oh wow dad! Then the 12 pack must be for married guys like you! You must be really lucky! Four for Friday, four for..." The father immediate bursts out in laughter. The perplexed look crosses the boy's face once again. "What's so funny?" "Well son, you are right, the 12 pack is for married guys... but one for January, one for Februrary, one for March..." 
This is probably the easiest complicated dirty joke to remember. 
I've told this joke a multitude of times. Maybe one person has gotten it.  I don't tell this joke anymore. 
A backpacker is traveling through Ireland when it starts to rain. He decides to wait out the storm in a nearby pub. The only other person at the bar is an older man staring at his drink. After a few moments of silence the man turns to the backpacker and says in a thick Irish accent:  "You see this bar? I built this bar with my own bare hands. I cut down every tree and made the lumber myself. I toiled away through the wind and cold, but do they call me McGreggor the bar builder? No."  He continued "Do you see that stone wall out there? I built that wall with my own bare hands. I found every stone and placed them just right through the rain and the mud, but do they call me McGreggor the wall builder? No."  "Do ya see that pier out there on the lake? I built that pier with my own bare hands, driving each piling deep into ground so that it would last a lifetime. Do they call me McGreggor the pier builder? No."  "But ya fuck one goat.."

This.  Logic class should be taught at the middle school level after they have decent reading comprehension and core math skills.   
Ethics is mandatory depending on major. I know doctors, nurses, lawyers, engineers, etc. Are required to have an ethics course before they get a degree. Tying ethics to professional action makes alot of sense and is reinforced alot in college. 
I would agree completely with that. Philosophy was actually a subject in school where I grew up, and I remember how increadibly dumb everyone thought it was, I especially loathed Parmenides. We couldnt grasp what the philosophers were trying to communicate, because we would always try to concretise the metaphors instead of thinking about the idea itself. Our prefrontal cortexes werent developed enough. On the tests we just regurgitated the textbook definitions without any grasp of what we were writing.  A few concepts were understandable though, like empiricism and some parts of logic. 
Maybe then they will finally be the generation that will fix the school system.  
Askphilosophy is a better sub. There is little to be found here. 
I hate to say it but I agree. Finance does need to be multiple years. The quality of life for the whole country would improve in a single generation.  I say start with 2 years and let's see what we can get after that. 
Hahaha, yeah tbh is was a bit of a circlejerk inviting title. On the otherhand talking about it might actually make change more likely! Whereas agreeing that we all like cute puppies probably wont change anything :P 
I think we should be doing both things.  A basic financials class is a gaping hole is public school curriculum - balancing accounts, calculating interest, etc.  But knowing logic is critical to learning quite a bit of biology, chemistry and physics.  Understanding formal logic at least a little should help people follow what's happening during experimental design and writing methods sections of reports. 
It's not developmentally appropriate for young children in many cases. 
Math itself is philosophy, in a different form(logic).  Some basic principles are covered when discussing the Scientific Method.  I think in general it comes down to interest.   Kids have so many things in their lives pulling in different directions that to devote enough time in understanding philosophy doesn't happen.  Hell,  look how history is taught and tested.  Most history teachers approach history from a purely factual basis(memorizing dates, events).  Tying different events together doesn't happen. 
nothing encourages children to question the accepted truth then to teach them what to read and how to interpret it.  
Could you care to explain how it would be bastardized? Don't confuse bastardized for simple, if that's what you're thinking. 
Wait... you read Judith Butler at a Christian religious school? I Haven't read a full book from her but I feel her whole gender not inherently existing thing wouldn't jive well with Christian interpretations of gender and such. 
totally agree. Way more applicable to the real world than a lot of philosophical discourse and that's kind of the theme of the article.  
I came here looking for someone to say this. It's hotly debated whether or not *the Prince* was a work of satire.  
I found that before I read it I could kid myself into thinking the politicians were just incompetent. Now it just seems like they're doing it on purpose! Make's you think - if politicians weren't Machiavellian would they even be at the top? 
Machievelli didn't really advocate for cruelty to the populace in the sense of a Kim-Jong Un or a dictator. While cruelty is evil, it can serve a purpose (I believe 1 example was the public display of a cruel man who was murdered and left out for all to see). And even then he said that you should do it in 1 quick succession so that nobody can take up arms against you and so the hated of the people would fade with time. 
Glad you mentioned this, because this article's interpretation of The Prince is a more outdated opinion. 
Maybe if you bought the "Cliff Notes" for specific books, then you might understand the meaning of  the story and style of the author. These notes sometimes are used to bypass reading the assignments, but using them together with the book could help you remain interested.  
While I don't agree the book was a satire, it wouldn't matter. The subject matter is held in high regard and holds valuable information for ruling subjects. In other words; whether or not the book is satirical, or whether or not Machiavelli was just joking around is irrelevant and your professor did you a disservice. 
Who say they aren't?  For the analogy to be as close as possible, the requirement is humans obliviousness to the fact that they are livestock.  
A vapid meat eater huh? So you like your meat boring.  Nah, but in actuality I agree with your comment in that I find this carnivorous sentiment distasteful. 
Nature is arguably far more cruel and animals suffer far more when in nature. It's full of starvation and ruthlessness.  If it was between living in a non factory farm (which is disgusting) or in the wild, I might choose the farm.  Food security, safety from predators, communal living. Sure there is death at the end but my life expectancy would be higher on the farm (obviously not in all situations e.g. lamb or calf). 
And unless you're the one carrying this out and have a way to not get caught, what makes you or anyone you know and love immune from the "culling"? 
Fucking thank you, I'm glad somebody here said it.  
A key to the argument is that animals live happy and comfortable lives until their premature death. I don't think anyone is arguing that the way many industrial farmers treat animals bred for food production is ethical. It's an argument that prematurely killing them might not necessarily be unethical, as long as we also treat them well while they are alive. 
And occasionally are forced to cannibalize, leading to prion diseases... 
I see your logic but by that logic we should all go totally vegan (as in not eating or using any animal products), stop owning pets or livestock and all zoos/wildlife places that aren't for species preservation purposes as well as all circuses (because there still are some) should close down and we should give all animals all human rights as well as political power (and we should learn the animals' language naturally because would *we* want to be uplifted through cybernetic implants?). 
That seems true, I've read a bit about the gates foundation. As I understand it Bill and his wife set the high level goals. Then they have people to see those goals are met, these people are professional and knowledgeable in their field and want to do good. Also I feel like this article doesn't consider that philanthropic organizations like the Gates foundation can direct money across borders. The W.H.O. is comparatively weak not because it lacks funds but because countries don't like big powerful NGOs telling them what to do. 
Exactly. This boner's idea to have Zuckerberg's shares put into a trust and then have the public vote on where the funds should go is beyond moronic.  
It's funny how the Catholic church in my own country don't want to apologize to victims of church sanctioned paedophilia until they are compelled by a court but feel so brazen as to wave the flag of, "human beings have an innate dignity and you best respect that", when pointing the finger at other people. Other people who spend billions of dollars curing disease nonetheless.  
The teachers should run the school systems not people with contrary interests to both the students and teachers. 
You know there was a time where the income taxes on the top earners was around 80-90%. We call people from that era "the greatest generation." Maybe we shouldn't rely on the humanity of people to maintain our clean waterways and interstate system.  Just a thought.  
I enjoyed the read because its interesting to think about how if we assume the catechism is correct that "The goods of creation are destined for the whole human race" how can we reconcile that with the idea of the philanthropy or "love of all people" being increasingly controlled by powerful individuals who then decide what that "love of all people" means.  
I remember, as a young boy, when Microsoft's cronies came to our home and stole my mother's pearls. Then they peeled out while chugging Red Bull, leaving only a copy of Windows 95 in their wake. Damn capitalists! Stop making things people have a use for, you know we can't control ourselves! 
You have to really abuse the word "selfish" to construe working one's whole life to generate a fortune and then giving it away to be "selfish". If you don't like what these people are doing with your fortune you are free to make your own and give it to the government or a public trust.  Having the government seize it and waste a lifetime of work in a few days of war and wiretapping is a position driven by envy and bitterness. 
What, you think that capitalism is magically moral? That the invisible hand of the market will give money to those who need it most if you reduce your profit margins? That's just silly. It's transferring culpability and responsibility to a faceless mechanism that was never designed to perform that task and never has performed that task efficiently. 
I've yet to see this  Firs time I've looked at r/philosophy 
Sometimes you dont know if youre actually helping people and sometimes so called philanthropists are scammers. Its fine to be skeptical, discussion should have no bearing on the genuine philanthropists anyway. 
DAE addicts are scum of the earth and don't deserve compassion and understanding and help for their obvious self medicating behavior, poverty and hopelessness, but these obscenely wealthy capitalists who steal labor value of others and then launder their vast amounts of wealth through their charitable organizations for tax reimbursements and good PR are totally awesome?  This sub is rife with ridiculous neoliberalism and bootlicking. Disgusting. 
Gates has given away over $30B already in his life. Real piece of garbage.  
Zagsebski (i think thats how her name is spelled) helps highlight the  main tension that Gettier cases bring up. If your view of knowledge includes a form of justification which is independent of truth to some extent then it will be susceptible to counter examples where even though you will fulfil whatever set of conditions you want then you will not have a case of what one would intuitively call knowledge.   
Doesn't it seem then like you're in the category of "throw up your hands and admit that you can never 'know' anything"? 
I read somewhere that he has the highest citations-to-words-written-ratio by a factor of at least 10!! 
JTB + ABILITY to reflect on one's answer was my Epistemology professor's favorite 
But, in this context, 'I can see Zuckerberg standing before me' implies the statement 'Zuckerberg is at the concert.' The fact that Kanye can see someone who looks like Zuckerberg justifies his belief. His belief is also true. Therefore, the argument goes, the JTB account has to say Kanye *knows* Zuckerberg is at the concert. But this conflicts with our intuitions, so the conclusion is that JTB is false. 
True, but I think that's true of a lot of things in philosophy! Part of being a philosopher is taking edge cases too seriously! 
You're collapsing the justification and truth aspect into one. This would make emperical knowledge production impossible; how do you prove something is true? And not just "beyond a reasonable doubt", because that's justification territory.  
I ... what? Justification is not needed if everything is going right? You *are* kidding, I want to hope. 
The thing is, RD's definition of knowledge isn't the one we want to say applies to things like "I know how to get to the store from my house". We can certainly always be fallible, but to be permanently open is to lead to global skepticism that we truly cannot know anything and that doesn't seem very useful for us to believe. It's self defeating anyway (cause how can you know that you know nothing).   Epistemology is about finding a non-Cartesian definition of knowledge.  
It's not about believing outside testimony. The common definition for knowledge has been "justified true belief" up until the time of Gettier. Do you think knowledge does not require belief? 
Metaphysics is crucial to formulating potential outs in physics discoveries but I doubt any modern day metaphysics philosophers know or even engage with the world of experimental physics in a meaningful way. At best its a poorly informed parrot of paper conclusions and abstracts. 
I think metaphysics is best explained through a quick example.  Do all bachelors have to be unmarried?  Yes.  Why is this the case?  If I had free reign to create a world where I could change the laws of physics at will, I still probably couldnt generate married bachelors, or even imagine them.   This demonstrates that there are facts that need to be explored outside of the laboratory.  These facts constitute parts of reality that may never be explicable by direct reference to the behavior of matter/energy/fields.  We use metaphysics to explore questions relevant to such facts.   Im intentionally avoiding a definition of metaphysics because the very boundaries of the discipline and its subject are really up for debate! 
Metaphysics is not false by definition. By definition, it's the study of how to conceptualize our world and clarify our abstract objects of thought.  
Piggybacking off the top comment, but thanks to you (PM_ME...) and the rest of posters who provided criticisms and questions. I'll take more care to address these in my next videos. I've already made changes based on certain responses that made me more aware of what I need to make clearer.   Thanks!  Also, I'm very aware that this first video was *very* lacking and is more claim than explanation. First video, and it was rushed for the sake of putting something out. 
Precisely because of the thesis-antithesis-synthesis bs. Someone took a class or read a book and saw a similar pattern to 'false flag' crisis manipulation as a triad of creating a fictitious problem and fanning the flames of public reaction towards a desired predetermined solution outcome.  Nothing to do with Hegel, it just sounds a lot more ominous if you connect an old philosopher considered to be super intelligent with shady power-players controlling everything thanks to having knowledge of this philosopher's work. 
He clearly states that his method is not a typical method, it is not a formula to repeat on all content like formal logic's rules are.   Sublation is a *very early* concept in the Phenomenology and Logic, chapter 1 stuff. It's a descriptive concept, not an active one. 
No. Hegel is very stand-alone (especially the logic), background only makes things more interesting and clearer in context. 
No need. All you need to know is thesis, antithesis, synthesis right? I mean, he says it so often in Phenomenology... /s 
To get rid of arbitrary/contingent factors and maintain a purely necessary conceptual structure. If you intend to conceive what something is and necessarily must be, it must be on its own ground and no other. If it has context, you must likewise derive that context either from it or it from that context, and that context must itself be derived from something that eventually is actually absolute and not contingent or arbitrary. 
I'll take that in mind and work it in to further vids. 
He had personal problems with him, his critiques aren't good. 
But... he didn't try what you're saying he did. Second,, it's not *that* hard when you finally get how to read him. It's hard, but not impossible. 
" I can't bake a cake today and eat it yesterday, the period wherein I baked the cake comes logically prior"  Perhaps not the exact same cake you described.  But if you were to never die and live millions of billions of trillions of years, a cake MAY appear in front of you one day.  You may eat it, think it was great, try to recreate it...  ...and then it disappears the next day right in front of you 
1. Surely everyone can have a perspective about race since, insofar as race even exists, we all have one?  2. Surely anyone can be as objective as anyone else therefore?  3. Isn't demanding that there be a black contributor without regard to the merit of their contribution or the volition of the contributor... solely because of their race... racist? 
The argument only destroys the Monster in that it says that it is no longer morally correct to feed such a monster. The argument doesn't say, "no one could possibly act like a utility monster."  The argument is normative but you are objecting to it on descriptive grounds.  
It's not binary. It's a real number in the interval (-1, 1). 
I didn't normalise lifetime utility. We consider utility at any given point in time. After an event happens, the individual's utility space is reevaluated. I edited the article to correct that; please read the edit.        &nbsp;          This system only applies to humans and other sapient beings who may decide to adopt it.      &nbsp;        This isn't a system of utilitarianism--it's just a paradigm for reasoning about utility. In my system of utilitarianism, the utility for every individual is amplified by the utility they produce. So for example, even if living grants me more utility than Musk, you'd save Musk over me because of the utility Musk produces. But that isn't part of my system of utility--just my particular brand of utilitarianism.  
I'm mostly riffing off of the word "autopoiesis" but I realize the semantic isn't exactly the same between the two.  But by teleopoiesis I literally mean "the making of end directed behavior." 
Aw that's sweet. It's those little things that put a smile on your face. 
That sounds amazing, and then the end made me feel incredibly sad. But it sounds like you had a great relationship and that's all one could ever ask for. 
Aw that's cool. I can picture this as a final scene to the series finale of some family sitcom or something. 
Wow 6 years? What kept you two away from each other for so long? 
Oh definitely. His birthday is this week as well as father's day so it's perfect timing to give him something special.  
I made little paper golf clubs in school. I found out he still has them on his desk. :) 
In addition to this: having anything at all hanging from the rearview mirror can constitute obstruction of vision and get you pulled over or a ticket.  
How embarrassing it is depends on what you said when you started talking to the stranger. Hopefully nothing too personal! I can see how anything would be a bit uncomfortable though. They've probably already forgotten about it though. I always remind myself of that when I feel embarrassed.  
Would have been funny if the second car was also not your ride 
This made my day. Thank you for sharing. Your dad rocks. 
Yeah, if it was a guy my husband would have jumped to action, but it was a girl like you described so he just watched as confused as I was. You would think as a woman you'd be more careful about whose car you just jump into! 
In Australia it shows you the number plate, pretty much the only thing I look for because I'm bad at cars 
Probably going to take place in Alabama, Louisiana, or Texas. Just saying. 
I had something similar happen to me but my story is not as upstanding as yours. I freaked out at a rave while I was tripping on LSD and had to get outside. So there I was, Downtown Atlanta, on my own sprawled out on the ground. I was looking way too comfortable laying on the ground pretty sweaty from the raging. Anyways a homeless guy came up to me and gave me a dollar and said, "looks like you need this more than I do." At first i didn't know what was going on because I was tripping balls, but then it hit me that this homeless dude did what he could do to help. I was offended a little bit after he left, him thinking I was homeless and all and then I realized that was probably the kindest thing I have ever seen 
If I'm traveling alone, I sit in the front, if I'm traveling with someone, I sit in the back with them.  90% of the time I have great conversations with my Uber drivers when traveling alone. 
I walked in on a married couple banging on their couch years ago when I worked pizza delivery.      They had a house that looked like an apartment building in a neighborhood full of apartment buildings with only a screen door closed at the front, leading into what looked like a long hallway between apartments.      As much as I would like to say it ended like a porn all that really happened was a couple panicked moments of apologies, frantic scrambling to cover, and a very embarrassed tip. 
I can't stop laughing either at the mental image I have of you just slowly turning to see her in the other car. 
My husband was approached at Target once - he had on a red, collared shirt and khakis. A lady started asking him where the deodorant was located.  He's not usually quick on his feet but he immediately said - my best guess would be armpits LOL  They both had quite a laugh once she realized he was not an employee! :) 
That was a really nice thing for him to do! Beyond the call of duty! :) 
They have to have a sticker? Well there should be no issues then! 
Yeah then they take their sweet ass time to run up the fare. Cab drivers are a lot more shady than uber or lyft drivers. There's a reason cabs are going to be obsolete soon  
Thanks, I enjoy music and writing, but don't see myself making a career out of either. I've written a few children's books that I might try to get published at some point and I started playing piano last year, but have been a little too depressed and focused on getting a job to play recently. I really enjoy running and working out, but I've had to get rid of my gym membership because I don't have any money. Overall i'd say I'm very lucky all things considered, but it's hard to consistently tell myself I should just stay positive and move forward. 
I really appreciate your anecdote, it does help put things in perspective. I kow that realistically I need to accept my situation, stay positive, and move forward, but it's been tough to keep that mindset. 
I don't know why, but this made me laugh. Thank you. 
Thanks, it's absolutely true and I appreciate being reminded of that. 
You do a great job at presenting the problem, but any advice for those going through this? 
I would apply to those "3 years experience" jobs anyway. It's a relatively low bar and it's basically an excuse for them to say "we're not going to train you to do everything."   If you can learn things quickly you'll be fine. Your master's should count for one year, and you can point to many of the projects you've worked on in class as a separate experience. It's double dipping, but only a little.   The biggest problem with starting a career is that nobody wants to hire someone starting out. On paper, it's much safer to go with someone else.  
Sure, i'd run, play the piano, go on vacation, work out. 
Don't join it out of convenience, op . Do it only if you like it. The knowledge gained may not be transferrable to your net job  
Sorry I interpreted that as:  "hey, you know how it's our second date?" "yes" "I'm going to marry your sister." "... You bastard" 
My ex told me she wanted me to marry me someday like 2 months into dating me and then we broke up 2 more months later. Yeah OP slow tf down you're still way too early in the honeymoon phase to legitimately be looking at rings. 
My husband and I did something similar too! Knew we wanted to get married, became something we were talking about all the time with excitement, then decided to "just peek" at rings.   That day he came home with a beautiful blue topaz ring and proposed officially!! 
I noticed this too.  Classic case of only hearing what you want to hear. Two months is nothing. It's a blip of time while wearing rose colored glasses.  I don't see the point of getting married so soon after so little time.  If it's meant to be she will still be there in a year+ after you've gained financial stability and knowledge. 
I was 36 when I met my now-husband.   For years, I said it was insulting and that I would seriously reconsider a relationship with a man who made such a poor choice.   My husband orchestrated this amazing, fairytale proposal.   I mean, a fucking trained dolphin was involved. Seriously.   That night, when I called my parents to tell them, they were appropriately excited for us but they didn't seem surprised.   When I said as much, my mom was like "you have no idea how hard it was to not tell you. I've known for weeks!"  Turns out, hubs asked everyone in my family, including my nieces and nephews, before he asked me.   I really did re-evaluate things. But I arrived at the conclusion that his motives were very good, and that he intended no disrespect by it.   I'm glad I did. We are very happy.  
That's awesome! I don't really believe that you have to wait X amount of years or anything before you ask/talk about it. And thanks :)  
Thanks! Just how well we clicked off the bat, how we literally agree on everything that's important in a relationship, how much I like being with her, and just how much she shows how much I'm appreciated. It's something no girl has really been like before her.  
That's amazing good for you! Any advice for me at this stage from someone with experience?  
That's so sweet it brought a tear to my eye and I'm sending her this comment. Thank you and I hope I am!  
My parents got married at ages 20 and 18, after knowing each other for 4 months.   44 years later, they are still together. They have hated each other for most of my life.   You truly never know...  Which is why making the decision to get married so prematurely is a terrible idea.  
Oh no this isn't happening now at all. We both decided to wait a few months at least I'm not sure why everyone thinks we are going out getting engaged this second. Guess I didn't word it right.  
I like this idea a lot I already go to therapy and he has been helping a lot with this and offered to have her come in for a session with me soon  
Downvotes for a Wayne's World reference? Come on, Reddit. 
Exactly I don't want to wait and let this opportunity pass up. I know people say have fun in your 20s blah blah but I already have a full time job and we are both almost done with school and I've never had more fun than the fun I have when we are together. I don't see a reason to wait.  
I don't have a sex playlist. In fact I don't listen to music during sex. Well.. there was that one time when we blasted Vampire Weekend... Wasn't my idea though!  
I get the same feeling too, with 2 songs in particular. I'm not very open with my emotions, so it's beneficial knowing I can still feel all that shit after the fact too. 
That's exactly what I do too- it's also interesting because looking back you can tel which few months I was more stressed about school than others (the music is sadder/slower) 
My sort-of-ex (we had a super short relationship) keeps trying to introduced introduce me but though I like some of the songs (Blood, Sweat, tears, Chained up, B-DAY) I can't imagine watching the dances over and over again like she does. 
Chrono Trigger ftw.  Anyway, I always thought that situation happened only in movies ("I love you, you're amazing, we're perfect for each other, but we have to break up because reasons.") People really find the love of their life and break up because of logistics? How "amazing" could it have been? Not attacking you I just always assumed people were remembering those relationships with unrealistic fondness. Anyway hope you're doing well! 
Yea I use it to bond with people too. I remember many nights just laying in bed at a girls house just getting them to show me their favourite songs n shit. I think you can tell a lot about a person by what music they listen to. One girl was all classic and alternative rock, another was pop, my girl now is all rap and sexy r&b, it's real interesting. I just wish Spotify didn't cap at 3,333 songs on a device so I wouldn't have to delete anything for my new shit. 
Oh lord you poor soul. I was into p!atd  for a solid three minutes, though I have to say my 21 pilots phase took about 6 months to kick. 
It happens to the best of us, stay strong brother. 
As a chronically depressed person, I listen to sad music because it helps me feel not alone with my feelings when no one I know is as depressed as I am.  
Yo I got stretches of classic rock, indie, metal, classical, edm, house, and remixes through out my whole shit, and my typical genres are rap and soul. My minds been opened to basically all genres if it sound good to me now. 
Thank you! The age gap has rubbed some people the wrong way, but a lot of our friends and family support us. She makes me truly happy and has made me see meaning in life as I really wanted to end my life shortly after my wife died, she has made me want to keep going and I love her so much!  
Thanks, she makes me happy and has helped me through my depression and I can't wait to marry her this weekend!  
Well, Reddit kept me busy for over 12 hours a day for the last 3 years. I would not be here to reply to you if Reddit hadn't kept me company honestly...   I just signed a 1 year lease with my new gf. Hang in there, someone is looking for you right now!  
The biggest difference I saw play out in real life was 25 years.  He passed when he was 87.  They had 2 kids. They were married over 20 years and were very happy.  
Thanks, I do think some days that I'm just an old man, but my fiancee makes me feel so young! I love her so much!  
As someone who's finished two relationships from 10-14 years older, I hope I get this peace of mind. There are spells where I feel stable enough to let their opinions bounce off, but there are other times I'm terrified of loving someone that much older than me and I start feeling like I'm not equal, even though every experience has told me I am.  
My gf is older, makes less money and is average looking.   But we laugh like idiots when we are together, it's fantastic! Wasted 22 years with someone that was pretty to look at...  
That's so exciting! The wait must be a drag but they do say it's who you know and not what you know. My fingers are crossed! 
You will be in my position, if you want to get there then the only thing holding you back is yourself. It took me five years to get back into education, I kept putting it off each year until I finally realised I needed to otherwise I will never progress.  If you truly want to then go for it! 
Sorry, the American education system is different to mine, could I get an eli5 on the "big ol' super 8"? And the 4.6?  I assume 9.7 is out of 10 and that's fantastic!  
I've heard the first year referred to as a throw away year, it's a chance for people to learn the standard requirements and gives valuable insight into their capabilities. You can only ever improve from those foundations. Being an A student now is fantastic and I hope you go as far as you can. 
That's only a few days away!   Year one has been fun but I'm excited to be getting one step closer to graduating. 
Ah that feeling is awful, I'm sure you have done well and that there is nothing to fear. Have a relaxing night and try to stay positive. 
Still an accomplishment to be proud of, enjoy that feeling. 
Absolutely, my problem now though is that I have nothing to do until September, yeah I have a part time job and volunteer but nothing to challenge me. I'm really looking forward to going back. 
Graduation must've been so exciting, what's next for you? 
A local one within a small town that has only been established as a university centre for a few years.   I'm positive you have passed the year though, when do you hear back about the last module? 
try to attend every lecture/pay attention/study, try new things and as always have fun! 
Job happiness is essential, you need to do what makes you happy. I hope all comes your way. 
Thank you, the next few weeks will fly by and then that awful waiting period sets in while everything is being marked.  Hope you have done well. 
I know! It's strange, love it though. It's always so nice when a community bands together.  This is no longer my achievement, it's ours. 
It is a great feeling and yeah I focus on what's ahead but I have time to celebrate this achievement  Feedback is always necessary, it's part of the process to learn from mistakes and improve.  I agree, being at university has opened many doors with many people I would not have met otherwise and the support is amazing. 
How long is the exam?  Make sure to stay hydrated and best of luck. 
It'll only ever improve from here. You have the basics behind you now to bounce from. 
How do you feel they both went? I'm awful being put on the spot, would rather do essays. 
That's what I like to hear!  Are you finished completely or due to go back in September? 
August is such a long way away, fingers crossed on your results.  Sounds like you've had an interesting two years.  In year two I'll be looking at legislation in practice, capacity, professional competence and three more modules I cannot remember off the top of my head. 
You can tell me and Reddit, I'm always happy to hear about peoples accomplishments  
To be fair an apprenticeship is brilliant, depending on the pay. Learning on the job and earning is the best way. 
It can be difficult getting to know someone. Sometimes taking a chance is worth it though.  
Quite likely the case. She's a bit weird, but I love that. 
This was exactly my experience.  I always thought the ideal of romance and affection and emotions and just being able to connect on every level with a man was a pipe dream. I had never been in love, and never expected I would be.  Finding someone who could handle my weirdness and pitch in some of his own, someone who was open to expressing how he feels about me and does it often, someone who's compassionate and kind and gentle... all of it seemed like something from a book, something that would never happen, especially not to ugly, dumb, annoying, crazy me.  Then it did, and my life was changed, and I can't imagine life without him.  Congrats to OP, and congrats to you as well! :) 
Just jump in with both feet. Don't overthink it. If it was meant to be you'll know. :) 
Yup, like she encourages me and makes me want to be a better person. I hope she feels that I do the same for her. 
Yeah, it seems you're right. I was a bit of an idiot for thinking I did understand and that everyone else was the idiot for believing in love. 
Love is a great drug. And as with any great drug, love will ruin your life.  
I lost two childhood friends in a car accident seven years ago when I was 17 years old and I never cried (or cried for something else since then) and ended up being a pretty cold and unfazed person from it.  Then earlier this spring I was just chilling one night listening to music while sipping on a Vanilla Coke. Out of the blue I remembered back to fourth grade when I was the new kid in school and my two new friends took me on a little adventure off school grounds (which was forbidden of course) to go buy something at a nearby grocery store. That's when we all tried Vanilla Coke for the very first time.  So I started thinking about shit like how that one adventure, or the other times we were together now only exists in my own clouded memory and eventually they will be gone forever.  All those suppressed feelings just came out of nowhere and I bawled my eyes out for like an hour. It really did feel great to have a good cry. I forgot how snotty you get though! 
Its strange cause I dont cry. I am an emotional person but it takes a lot to push me to tears.   But this was so sudden. Thanks btw! 
Which equates to 2.5(ish) centimeters per inch so the average person who is 5 feet 8 inches is 170cm tall(not taking into account be quarter and half inches) 
No idea. I know the metric system, I just can't convert. 
"How tall are you?"  "-sharp inhale- 4'20""  "Nice."    So how tall is the average Chicago resident? 
Same. And it's kind of the in-between period right now where one week it's not as balls and the other it's raining like shit. 
*Yeah, summer gets way too hot sometimes, but sometimes it's raining and I like when it's raining.* 
*What about late autumn when it's raining and it's dark?* 
Yup. Spring as a continuous season hasn't been a thing in awhile. Those 60-70 degree spurts from January to May mixed in with 25-50 degree weather kind of suck. It doesn't stay warm til June, even May has days where you need a coat. 
Same. Plants are starting to bloom but there's not too many bugs yet, it's warm but it's not too hot yet, and lots of rain. Love it. 
*What about late fall when  it's dark and rainy all the time?* 
*Hey, Lizzy! I like spring, too. But I love autumn more. I love how melancholic everything is .* 
*Do you like the sea? I absolutely love to be by the sea when the sky is grey, there's little rain and heavy wind.* 
*I like that in the autumn the new seasons of my favourite TV shows start...* 
What about moving to a place where it's usually cold? Like Alaska or Canada  
I said almost exactly the same thing when the Honda finance guy tried to sell me an extended warranty. 
Excuse me I'm not from the US. Where else can one get a car if not from a dealership?! 
Yes--all the math throws them off! I hated that my husband had to save me but whatever.  
Uh, financially it actually makes sense if your lease payments include an interest. You actually pay less if you pay more up front. 
Glad to meet you here, Margaret! How have you been? 
Finishing a dissertation is pretty badass on it's own.  Things getting even better is awesome! 
I don't remember how I found it either, but I've never left.  :) 
I'm guessing you're in the Southern hemisphere then?  I've only really seen snow once.   
Wow, that's a lucky random click.    I'm sorry you're still not entirely thrilled with work, but at least it's a step in the right direction. 
I see what you did there, Brain.   But how will we get the pants on the monkeys? 
Yeah this flick is NOWHERE near that mature haha. CU was entertaining but I did read the books as a kid and I mainly went as a service to that 
If you read the books there are definitely a lot of shoutouts which I loved. But this is definitely a kids show with a TON of lowbrow humor 
Omg the references, Harold and George's over-the-top-ness and the sprinklings of more adult humor a la failings of the public school system did it for me. It definitely sated the nostalgic in me while my adult, mature side is "who the hell is this manchild, idk him. I'm gonna induce dissociative disorder to just get me the hell out of here" 
Omg I also really wanted to see F8 when that came out too. All my friends were like 'Bruh, your taste in movies suck.' I mean I do got tastes fir the unusual 
Omg going with some friends would def have gotten rid of most my shame. What inspired you guys fill watch it? 
I really enjoyed the references to the book. And they had some pretty nice political jokes about public schools. Animation was amazing. Other than that they really run the Poopypants name joke to the ground 
Def do that. Walking oitta that theater felt weeeeiiirrrddd 
I mean......it does have its adult funny moments but SOOOO much of the humor is child-level toilet humor which is to be expected. Definitely made for the kids more so than those who read them as kids.  If you have kids, bring them. You'll get a lot less weird looks coming out of the theater. If it goes on Netflix, watch it there and have no one else be all the wiser 
Yeah I figured after I walked out haha. If anyone asks me irl what I saw, Imma say I saw Megan Leavey 
I wish I had white hair... I'd look just like one of those character's in my japanese animes! (ie. Kaworu) 
Yes exactly! With my Nan being sick and dying this year, I've learned not to worry about small stuff anymore. It isn't worth it  
I'll work on getting a picture posted! It's not completely white yet, not even close, but I have more white in it than before  
I love seeing natural greys and whites in people's hair, personally; there's something vaguely dignified about it to my eyes. 
Yes vitiligo is exactly what it is haha I have a bunch of weird things. Turners Syndrome, I'm deaf, and vitiligo haha  
Dealing while on probation. Sounds like a class act, that one. 
Most of my close friends from back then moved on, like you did, but the guy that texted me still lives in the area and last I'd heard, he was doing pretty well for himselr. I was just hoping he'd want to grab a beer and catch up. But nope, just wanted another pawn in his money game. 
Well, I suppose I'm glad the guy I talked to launched right into his pitch and didn't waste my time then!  
I've gathered since out chat that he's got a daughter, recently got engaged to his daughter's mother, and has a steady job. My guess is he was feeling infallible after his girlfriend gave birth, he got engaged, and started his job. It appears (based on his facebook account,) that those things happened, in that order, just before he got sucked in to this shitty scheme. So it seems he's doing fine, he's just naive and/or gullible. 
I've thought about it for that particular person, I am just waiting to see how it will go now...I may need to minimise our contact. I think, unfortunately, that he is still interested in me in a more-than-just-friends way though we've talked about it and I said I wasn't feeling the same way...who knows.   Thanks for the advice! 
Hi! I enjoy videogames too! Lets virtually hang out! 
Hm, you are right...I probably have to change my mentality and maybe the way I approach people and things. As for the friends, I think I am ready to say "enough is enough" if I feel too uncomfortable,  I am out of patience and I guess I might not be the most awesome friend but I can't exactly change myself now completely.    
Haha, well that is a good thing.   It gives you the higher ground I think! 
I actually think this way as well. The trouble starts when I notice that many people have a not so friendly stance and I start to wonder what I do wrong...  Maybe it's really nothing or maybe I should change something. Of course I won't become a hypocrite just so some people will like me but if I am wrong somewhere I need to know. 
You are right, I am sure I come off as cold to many people. I want to change that and I think I have, to a certain degree, but sometimes I cannot be consistent about it and I fall back to the old ways.   Still, it should be my focus if I want to make people comfortable in talking to me. 
Ahahahah, cool story.   Yeah a whack with a stick may solve any kind of problem. 
Thank you!  Yes, I felt this way too where I don't really care if everyone likes me, it is impossible after all.  However, I seem to notice that even my professors at university seem kinda weird around me. Well, not everyone but some do.  Maybe they do this with other people though so I might be reading too much into that.   I guess I have to accept that I am not as easy to like as other people might be since I am kind of distant inherently.  
Exactly, I am sure I have misinterpreted actions or words that people say to me, it's inevitable in this life and maybe I take some things more seriously than I should. I wish it were easy to know the intentions of others but sometimes you just gotta ask.   Maybe I'm just feeling low lately and that is why certain behaviours are impacting me more.  That was a great story and thank you for sharing it! Now if there's anything that bothers you, you can approach him as a friend and tell him. 
Those are some good advice! Thank you :)   I was actually thinking of doing some martial arts maybe next year so that would probably make me feel better and maybe get to know more people.   About that book, I think I read some chapters in the past it really is a very practical book.   I might need to read it once more though. 
Babies of animals are eaten and it is okay so, yeah got you there!   
At least we are not alone!   I actually thought about it being about looks and I thought the same thing as you. However, In the end I believe that it is most likely due to my low self esteem and bad mood showing in my face etc than anything else since even less attractive people have friends and are even more like able than some really good looking people who are distant, you know?  It has to do with people feeling comfortable approaching you and I know that I don't make ppl feel that way. I also don't make much eye contact which I think ppl might find suspicious so yeah.  I am still figuring this out but I think it can be solved though it won't be easy... 
Hey, I think that in your case it's probably people not understanding how you interact since you said you are not good at human interactions. I am not great either especially when I am tired and don't feel like putting the work to be friendly but that's cause I am mostly an introvert.  So, yeah people won't understand who you are deep inside since they only get to judge you from one or two conversations but don't bring yourself down. People who know you well value you so I am sure when others get to know you well enough they will see who you are.  Yeah, this friend of mine is kind of strict when it comes to friendship. I made a huge mistake lately for which I apologized but maybe he hasn't forgiven me yet :/. 
Thank you!  I am trying to have a good mindset even though there might be some negativity.   Well, everyone deals with that anyway. 
You sound like you have thought well about the situation you're in and are dealing it very maturely, that's good!   Obsessing about something certainly won't resolve it, I know so I will try to keep it in the back of my mind.  Also, what happens in school may seem very important but it is not that much. You realize that after you graduate. I was not a popular kid either, barely talked with half of my class but whatever.   
Ah yes, the internet can be a really cruel place.   Don't take it personally though, everyone is trolled or attacked by people who are going through tough times in the real world and need to vent somewhere.   Also, usually trolls are kids so yeah. 
Yeah, people are different when in groups. It requires a different approach in that setting since when there are many people it is difficult to really bond with everyone there.  But since you are good at interacting one on one I am sure you will be fine in larger groups..it usually requires commenting on what other people are saying or sharing a story or a joke. That's about it in my experience. 
You are not wrong. I am  not on my best psychological state lately and I know this is probably affecting how I seem to people.  It's just that I feel like I might never change and will always make a bad impression. Well, not to everyone but to many people.  It's probably not true though, I just got to work and better myself. 
Deeper connections are hard to come across but definitely one way to have one is by being with the same person daily as you said.  I know that I restrict myself with my personality sometimes in that I don't share a lot about myself or only superficial things and nothing really emotionally deep.  However, my friends rarely do the same so I guess we share that.  About the one that criticizes me, yes it is pretty annoying but at other times he is really cool to hang out and we communicate very well.   I guess, time will tell what needs to be done.  Thank you for the advice! 
I know, there's almost nothing in the world that another person hasn't gone or isn't going through it.  Time and patience is key, you are right.   Thank you! 
Well, I don't know if it's any x-factor, it's mostly that our group of friends has stayed this way for many years without any major fights at all-which is weird if you think about it- and I believe it is due to us being just superficial friends, we haven't shared many meaningful moments yet. However, we click in that we all have peaceful personalities I guess and respect each others boundaries.   Yes, I have to take criticisms and I do understand when I am objectively wrong on a matter. I understand that I am not perfect and I am going to make mistakes, all I can do is prevent them from happening another time and apologize.     
Haha, I get what you're saying. I think I feel this way a lot lately because I had my own problems for a while now and I became less tolerant to other people, not that I told them anything but I just didn't care much about my image I guess.   
It usually goes that way with people, no one is likeable by everyone.   I don't think I have depression because I know that there are people that like me it's just that, lately, some people seem to be negatively predisposed against me (or maybe that is what I make of their behaviour).   Of course, that is natural but I thought I'd whine about it for once haha. 
It's this opening up that I have a hard time doing, this has been my focus but I need a lot of work to manage to be an open person.   It's not impossible since I've made some steps but it doesn't come easy for me. 
True, all we can aim for is our best selves even if we never achieve our presumed "perfection".   I guess social stuff are rather overwhelming at times. 
Being honest is a good trait and I guess it shows confidence.   I get that being too popular might be tiring and kind of annoying in the end but at least you have some genuine friends, that is all that matters!  It is true that speaking my mind and saying what I believe is something that I like to do but maybe don't do as often because I am not really comfortable with speaking to strangers or ppl that I don't know well. I should definitely work on that as well.  Oh and I get that honesty can be harsh so I see why you might think that you are more unlikeable but at the same time everyone respects it so I don't think it is that bad. 
Ahh I would love that. My dog is asleep right now I will  surely go and cuddle with him when he wakes up :) 
Hell, why not look up the whole movie! It's great for laughs :) That and the holy grail are both hilarious. 
There is not much you guys can do tbh. This guy who I have been talking to for like the past 5 months or so who I thought was my friend just completely let me down after I said something about his behaviour how he treated another friend of mine. Just sucks that you go on to trust someone and think they are your friend but end up fucking you over and blaming you for it. Also had a test today which I completely ruined.  
Thanks. I'd like to think there is a market for what I do, but I am terrible at promoting my work. 
I've been wondering how to find someone to promote my work as I am crap at that. 
I tried that years ago. I didn't do great, I think because I was competing with mass produced items and I didn't understand the market. My work is ridiculously labor intensive. 
Thanks Todd. Means a lot coming from a fellow fabricator. 
Good catch on the Tuscaloosa. I have been a graphic novel fan for years, and a fan of good illustration generally. So much of children's lit is just a vehicle for the illustration. I don't know if or how it would get funded, but I think a pitch could be made for steel sculpture as illustration. 
Thank you so much. You're such a kind soul. This'll mean the world to him. Also I didn't know that but that's amazing ! Right now I'm able to put some of my paycheck towards food so he can eat but if there's a chance that we really need help in that department, I'll for sure head there. Thank you so much.  
Ooo thank you! I had no idea that this was a thing! 
Thank you love! Either way, I appreciate it so much.  
Number 3 and It's half truth because you are only half boy (? 
Professor Layton can help me here: the first can't be false, because the second and third one contradict with each other, so the question is simply, "is it true that you played a metal gig in front of a hundred people"? And I say, why not?  So I think number 3 is false. 
I'll complete the trio of guesses with Number Tres 
TIL Nebuchadnezzar isnt just the name of a ship in the matrix 
I don't know how you could possibly make up number 3, it takes imagination. I think it's number 2 
Lol same, I struggled to think of another truth to use  But I'll venture a guess and say number 3 is the lie 
WOW, your grandfather IS the American Football Hall of Fame?  
being an eagle scout is quite an achievement and I makes sense that you would put it there if it was true. Number 3 is absolutely possible so I'm guessing that it's 1 
What do you consider good knowledge on music and movies? 
There is a poodle sanctuary in my city so I'm ready to believe that. The one about the blackberries seems too silly to be true however 
1 is really specific. On number 2 you're having to explain the concept of the skill, which would make it an inconvenient answer to make up. Number 3 is very vague and details were probably left out to make it seem more incredible. I'm gonna go with number one. 
Ok 1 and 2 are REALLY cool, but I'm gonna guess the third one is a lie. If it's only half-truth, I'd guess you only ate one pizza-sized pancake not 2 
I think 1 is false. 2 is a lot more common than most people think and you have water in your username, so 3 makes sense. 
I'm going with no.1. I want to come up with some cool explanation, but then I'll look dumb when you tell me I'm wrong.  
Number 3 is my guess as it's the least related, but maybe you did that on purpose. 
I wanna believe all of these are true but I'm gonna say number 3 
1? You've been pronounced dead 3 times now, haven't you? 
Sorry to read this :(   *Nana internet hug*  You take care. Better days ahead! 
Man, what a missed opportunity.  At the very least OP should have got a coffee date out of this. 
Lol yeah it does. But in a comedy, the guy's usually not too socially awkward to ask the girl out haha 
I've learnt to look up too, a lot of people are nicer than you may think, most smile back. It's nice to see someone smiling, brightens your day a bit immediately! 
It sure does lol. Sounds crazy, a similar thing happened to me - I was at a music festival like 400 km's away, when I got back home I met a random guy with the wristband in a small shop. 
Shame it didn't work out. I never pick up the courage, that's my problem 
Lol right? I just felt like it was long overdue and I wanted to show my appreciation for all that he does for me. He deserved a good b day this year. Plus I'm stoked AF for third eye blind next month! Lol. 
I hope you get it soon! Everyone deserves a good surprise party. 
Damn that made me feel really good. We have been through some SHIT trust me. I think we are finally at a point where it's all love and no more immature bullshit that comes with being with someone since highschool. Thank you that really means alot.  
Because we are really big on fishing & redfish are just cool to me lol.  Thank you! 
that's why none of my fish trawler workers will talk to anyone isn't it 
We talked a bit when he came into my work. My friend who's a cashier and knows what he looks like has told me he's come in when I'm not there, looks around a bit and leaves. He say's hi when we pass each other but I honestly think he may just be an out going friendly guy who talks to everyone.   I'm just a painfully shy person, last time I talked to him I turned bright red. I don't actually know how to flirt like a normal person either, I'm either too blunt and forward or too subtle.   
Him but you're completely right. I keep kicking myself over it and I keep getting more chances and blowing it.  
I feel the same way with all the other girls, I'm not really classically pretty I'm short with short hair and everyone else is so pretty there. I was so close to talking to him today then I saw him talking to a beautiful girl and boom I grew feathers and flew out of there.  
I'm going to have to say its not pathetic, mainly because that's how most of my crushes go.  
unless one of us goes at a different time through out the week or he comes into my work again it may not be until next weekend, but i will update. 
The front door is definitely unlocked. I can see it from here haha.  
I called our after-hours maintenance. The lockout fee is $500! 
My finger doesn't make any noise when it strikes my palm. 
Yes there is a skin glue. Dermabond. Commonly used for lacerations that aren't complex enough to require stitches or staples. It's basically super glue. 
"So. Tell us more about how you glue the wood to the other wood." -__- 
To me, bugs and spiders are more scary than big bears for some reason 
Were you afraid of animals/snakes/insects when you lived there? 
That's me on almost every Saturday, when I don't have school. Sleep late, get up late, and waste the day. Hope you celebrate your dad's birthday just like you had planned :).  And happy birthday in advance :) 
Uh-oh. Looks like you've been busy. Parties are boring. I hate being around many people. I prefer to be in the company of a few people I like.  What book did you read?  P.s. Get well soon :) 
I am really sorry for what you are going through. I have been through a similar phase. Depression really takes the life out of you. I was in grade 11 when depression struck me, and my grades dropped like hell.   Nature always is the best medicine. There's a small nature reserve near my place, and I often bike till there, to enjoy the sunrise :)  I really wish you the best of luck. Don't let depression win. I have faith in you :) 
Is the discord active ? I've been meaning to join it when I get a new headset 
Yes.  My dog is AWESOME!!!  ;)  As far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life I would say no.  The bullying was only on camera.  The minute the director yelled cut I was definitely one of the "in crowd".  lol  
I remember meeting you at Hedwig (great show by the way).    Because of the popularity of P&R it's changed many things in my life.  99% good...1% not so good.  I can honestly say that part of the 99% is the interaction I have with the fans.  I know a lot of actors aren't happy to stop and talk with their fans but I'm always happy to take pics and chat a little.  There were many MANY years as a working actor that nobody knew who the hell I was.  The fact that I was lucky enough to land a show like Parks and get to have an impact on peoples lives is something I will never take for granted.  I'm honored (and humbled) that people like my work and want to come up to let me know.  For those wondering what the 1% is that isn't so great...people sneaking pictures.  I would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it.  For some reason that seems much more invasive to me.  :) 
Missing P&R is something I will do the rest of my life.  I spent six years (7 seasons) with the greatest cast and crew that has ever been assembled (in my humble opinion).  Thankfully the cast are constantly texting each other and staying in touch.  I keep in touch with a lot of the crew too.  That being said...nothing will ever be like going to work every day to laugh with people you truly loved.  As far as people being different from their characters...As actors I think we all bring a certain part of ourselves to every role.  It's just natural.  Nick Offerman is a smart man who can build anything.  So that's like Ron.  On the other hand I think politically they might be at odds.   
Great question.  I've been blessed to have been working in this crazy business for over twenty years.  Because of the popularity of Parks I'll always be best known as Jerry which is a gift.  I love when I get to sink my teeth into a dramatic role.  Dark comedies are my favorites.  It's one of the things that led me to Middle Man.  I'm not the "funny" guy in the film yet I get a lot of laughs.  I love getting a new script and figuring out what I'm going to do with it.    As far as finding something I did in the past...hmmm...I did an episode of Diagnosis Murder where I got to play a crazed serial killer.  I had a lot of fun with that.  I would also check out a remake of Harvey I did many years ago with Leslie Nielsen, Swoosie Kurtz and Harry Anderson.  It was one of my first films.  I look like a baby.  It was an amazing experience.  :) 
Great question.  From what I understand one of the writers were standing next to me at the urinal and thought it was time to mix real life and TV life.  Made perfect sense to me.  lol  ;) 
They were all funny.  What a lot of people don't know is that after every scene we did a "fun run".  That's where we got to play around and do whatever we wanted while telling the same story that was on the page.  Most of us had an improv background so it made sense to let us play together.  We did that EVERY DAY.  I think it's one of the reasons we stayed so close as a cast.  That being said...Chris Pratt is so off the cuff funny that it's crazy.  Really really funny.  I had fun working with each and ever one of them.  That's not Hollywood bullshit.  I loved them all...and still do.  :) 
Thanks so much.  My dogs names are Chase (the white one) and Stella (the black one).  They're both rescues.  Last year I lost both of my other dogs to cancer.  I don't have kids so the dogs become like children (some people think that's crazy...that's OK).  When they passed away I didn't think I could ever go through it again.  After nine months my gut was telling me that it was time again.  I went to the Linda Blair World Heart Foundation and found Chase.  I knew within two minutes of meeting him that he needed to be with me for the rest of his life.  A few months later I went to the Amanda Foundation and met Stella.  She had obviously been abused and needed some loving.  They're brought the smile back to my face after losing my other two pups.  :) 
It's totally different than any other role I've played.  My character Lenny starts out in the same vein as Jerry from Parks.  A sweet, nice guy.  Unfortunately for Lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to Las Vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by Andrew J. West).  This turns his life upside down.  From that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude.  Playing the character was terrifying because if I didn't make it work the film doesn't work.  From what I hear I did it justice.  :) 
I love when I get to different types of characters.  That's what actors do.  Like I mentioned earlier it's hard not to be typecast but it's part of the challenge of being an actor.  :) 
I try to keep something from every shoot I'm on.  Most of it just sits in a box.  I figure someday when I'm old (well...older) I'll want to take a trip down memory lane.  I have the Jerry Gergich Conference Room RIP plaque on my desk.  I see it every day.  :) 
You nailed it.  Li'l Sebastian will be starring as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men".  Can't wait to see it.  :) 
Tell you dad thanks from me.  Without our Kickstarter campaign we would not have been able to make the film that we did.  I'm still blown away that strangers gave us their hard earned money to help us make our dream project.  It's very humbling.  I mentioned earlier that I have too many all time favorite actors to mention.  I'm been blessed by being around not only amazingly talented people but also amazing good people.  For me that's more important.  Getting to work with Andrew J. West, Josh McDermott and Anne Dudek on Middle Man was an unexpected treat.  I didn't know any of them and they came with their A games.  Really amazing people and actors.  :) 
I wouldn't say overly nice.  We were all just good friends doing good work and laughing our asses off every day.  :) 
My favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on Parks.  He had also worked on The Office.  His name is Dean Holland.  He really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us.  My favorite actor that I've worked with is too broad of a question.  I've fallen in love with so many people I've worked with over the years.  By "love" I mean I loved being around them.  :) 
LOL  That's a great analogy.  I'm not sure that's what I was thinking at the time but who knows?    As far as pulling classic Jerry moves....every day.  We all do.  I won an Emmy last month and as I was walking up the steps to get the award I just kept thinking "don't fall...don't fall". If I had fallen it would have been another "Jerry" moment that I would hear about forever even though I won the award for a different show.  lol  :) 
I've thought about this question many many times so credit for the question goes to me.  ;)  The answer is ... 1 Li'l Sebastian-sized Aziz.  :) 
I thank God every day that the acting thing worked out.  Otherwise I have no idea what I'd be doing.  I guess because I'm a talker and a bit gregarious that I could have gone into sales but honestly I don't know.  A lot of my family around me are in the trades...like pipe coverers and fitters.  I'm too damn uncoordinated and lazy to do that so again...THANK YOU GOD FOR LETTING THIS WORK OUT!!!!!  :) 
Totally thought up by Aubrey during the last commercial break.  My favorite part when watching the video is how the other cast members reacted when they realized what was happening.  Aubrey is a super funny person.  She knew it wouldn't be funny to make out with Pratt or Scott.  She knew it had to be with the old fat guy to get the real laugh.  I was happy to oblige.  :) 
The joke was funny but his laugh made it legendary 
I typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions".  ;) 
I think it's multiple reasons, including that one.  In season two, it's mentioned that he had plastic surgery, and he explains that it was in the wake of getting hit by a fire truck.  In season six, he tells Chris that he gained "a lot of sympathy weight" and that he used to look like Chris before he had kids.  So what this means is Gayle fell in love with a very different-looking person - a skinnier and probably better-looking pre-accident Gary, who still had a massive schlong, and probably still had his kind, gentle personality.  We see the photo album of the experiences he had with Gayle, and he mentions how much he valued going home to his family right at 5 - they built a solid foundation for their relationship, which means after all of what changed, she still loved him because they'd build such a strong marriage, and also because of his massive schlong. 
I've never been able to see if I have mumps.  When I go to look I'm always distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.  ;) 
Nothing but nature that night.  I didn't know that was going to happen.  Aubrey leaned over and said "you wanna make out during the Li'l Sebastian song".  Within .01 seconds I said yes.  As a guy who doesn't get roles as the romantic lead I listened to Rob Lowe's advice.  Just follow whatever the girl does.  So when we started kissing and I felt Aubrey tongue make its move I knew all bets were off.  lol  I'll be on Seth Meyers next Wednesday, June 14th.  Check it out.  Maybe Aubrey will surprise me and we'll make out again.  mmmm  ;) 
Thank you so much.  I love that scene too.  Any Jerry's on the crew?  YES!  Because I love them all so much I will not name names but I can tell you that there was the occasional mishap caused by the same person many times.  lol  Of course we still loved him.  :) 
I'm obviously not him but I think the show ended perfectly. I don't know if they can top that ending. 
My best bud was Retta (Donna).  Our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them.  Our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so I think that bonded us right off the bat.  We were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out.  I had lunch with Retta last week.  She's one of my favs in life.  :) 
HUGE Billy Joel Fan.  I was on a show yesterday talking about his song "My Life" as one of my all time favorites.  Billy tries to avoid me because of the Christie Brinkley issue.  He knows I could have taken her away from him.  EASY!  lol  ;) 
Awesome question.  Really something I've never thought about.  I would say that initially they would get along great.  They're both very devoted to family and inherently good people.  The journey that Lenny ends up on is not something Jerry would ever go along with so their friendship wouldn't last.  A night out for them would definitely involved a sundae.  :) 
Awesome question.  WOW!  I'm not sure which way to go.  On one had Pratt has turned himself into a physical machine.  On the other hand Nick is very smart and might be able to outmaneuver Chris.  Damn...I have to go with a draw.  :) 
DJ Roomba haunts my dreams.   I still wake up thinking I hear him coming down the hall.  Even talking about it now has me on edge.  ;) 
Mr. O'Heir?  Who the hell is that?  lol  Great question.  There's certainly a part of Jerry in Jim.  At least I hope so.  I think that Jerry is a very kind and caring person.  I would like to think that I have those attributes as well.  Unfortunately I don't have the temperament that Jerry has.  I can upset and people know it.  Jerry just seems to let it all roll off his shoulders.    I've always been a kind of people pleaser.  I'm not sure how healthy that is but it's who I am.  I've gotten better as I've gotten older which makes me happy but ultimately it's in my core to try and make people  feel comfortable...sometimes at my own expense.  Damn.  I need therapy NOW!  lol  ;) 
The Kardashian outtake is one of the funniest moments I've ever experience on any set ever.  Chris Pratt is so damn funny and he hits you with it when you least expect it.   For those who don't know what I'm talking about just go to You Tube and type in Parks and Rec and Kardashian.  You'll love it.  :) 
While I'm doing this REDDIT I've also been texting with the cast of P&R.  I have a Parks Fam text link on my phone.  We're always in contact whether it's to break balls or share what's going on with our lives.  The love you see on the screen only works because it was real off screen.  :) 
People always ask about regrets.  I don't think they're very healthy and certainly aren't going to help us today.  That being said...one of my regrets is not being involved in my high school theater department.  When I was a kid you were labeled depending on what you did or who you hang out with.  There were the burn outs, stoners, jocks, brains and a few others I'm probably forgetting.  In my day if you were part of the theater crowd you were known as a drama fag.  Unfortunately I let that term stop me from doing something that I probably would have loved.  Words are powerful and when you're young you don't realize that it just doesn't matter.  If I could go back to those days now knowing what I do I'd be happy to be called a drama fag.  :)  Tell them to work hard and enjoy every minute.  They will also make friendships that will last a lifetime.  :) 
The popular answer is going to be Offerman but IMO it's Aubrey Plaza. 
I have soooo many favorite episode of Parks.  The one I like to always mention is the season 2 episode called "The Hunting Trip".  I think it's one of my all time favs because it was the first time we were all out of the office together (other than April and Andy) and you got to see who we were in that world.  The scene where Donna (the awesome Retta) realizes her Mercedes has been shot is one of my all time favorite scenes of the whole series.    I also loved the Harvest Festival and the episode where Ben and Jerry had their day out together.  Ben had set up a special day for he and Leslie but she wasn't available.  He ended up doing everything with Jerry.  So damn funny.  I can honestly tell you that there is no least favorite episode that we shot.  Not trying to avoid the question...there just wasn't.  I have great memories of all of them.  :) 
Great question.  Mike Schur doesn't get talked about enough.  I can tell you that, in my opinion, Mike is a comic genius.  He knows what works and what doesn't.  We were lucky to have Mike with us throughout the run. Many times a show creator (runner) will leave after a show becomes successful because they'll be given other opportunities to start new projects.  Mike did start new projects (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) but never left us.  His voice is in every episode of P&R.  I think that's why the show never lost its strength.  Mike never handed us off to someone else.  Between him and Amy they were our fearless leaders and they took great care of us.  :) 
I love them too.  Thank you.  They love to roll and creative tons of dirt in my house. lol  When they play fight it gets so intense that sometimes I think they must have hurt each other.  They run at full speed and just smack into each other.  Two seconds later they do it again and their tales are wagging.  Crazy but so fun to watch.  They both love the dog park too.  And of course walks.  :) 
You saw me in Roseanne?  That's awesome.  Unfortunately I've never been on that show.  lol  But seriously, I used to watch Roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no.  You must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy.  ;)  As far as the reboot goes...I'm not sure.  Some things are better left alone.  :) 
Fart Attack is definitely classic.  I like the old school original with Mark Brandanowicz.  We were playing a game in the office that Jerry never wanted to play.  We had to dig dirt up on each other.  Jerry finally relents and says to Mark "I hear you've got two unpaid parking tickets" (big f'ing deal) and Mark says "I hear your adoptive mother smokes pot".  He looks at me and realizes he's hit a nerve.  He says "I'm sorry.  You didn't know your mom smoked pot?"  Jerry says..."I didn't know I was adopted".  The first and best burn for me.  :) 
There were so many outtakes that should NEVER see the light of day.  lol  We did some filthy silly stuff sometimes.  On the other hand we also all had our moments of brilliance when we were doing a fun run so I'm sure there's some stuff that I've forgotten that would have been fun to see in the show.  Ultimately our co creator Mike Schur always did what was best for the show.  He would never put in a guaranteed laugh if it didn't move the story forward. :) 
Aubrey and I dated for ten years before we eventually broke up due to a side relationship I was having with Joan Calamezzo.  It wasn't easy on any of us and I take full responsibility for the breakup.  That being said it didn't help with Aubrey started dating Joe from the Sewage Department.  That really hurt.  ;)  lol 
I just heard about that minutes ago.  I feel terrible.  She was a very very sweet lady.  For those who don't know Glenne played Ben's mother on Parks.  We had a lot of fun with her son set.  What a shame.  She was way too young.  :( 
Final seasons (and episodes) are tough.  I think the pressure to go out with an amazing story is tough to do.  I know I'm biased but I think that the writers at Parks nailed it.  I love the time jump and the fact that we get to see where these characters end up.  Some of my favorites shows didn't quite nail it for me but Parks did.  Again...I'm a bit biased.  lol  :) 
They had no choice. This was what they were ordered to do, and they studied so diligently because they were obedient. It is a culture where they have to listen to the authorities. But little by little, they would show some frustrations. They found it hard. Their dictionaries were outdated, which translated Korean words to English, and they didn't like to use English dictionaries for definition. They found different accents by the teachers (many were missionaries from deep South, with the Southern accent, or from New Zealand etc) difficult to understand. But these were just practical difficulties. Their real feelings about having to learn them? They couldn't really show it. They just felt worried that they were spending all their time learning English when their majors were within the field of science and technology 
There were so many things. They just learn totally upside down information about most things. But one thing I think most people do not realize is that they learn that South Korea & US attacked North Korea in 1950, and that North Korea won the war due to the bravery of their Great Leader Kim Il Sung. So they celebrate Victory Day, which is a huge holiday there. So this complete lie about the past then makes everything quite illogical. Because how do you then explain the fact that Korea is divided still, if actually North Korea "won" the war? One would have to question that strange logic, which they do not. So it's not so much that they get taught lies as education, but that that second step of questioning what does not make sense, in general, does not happen, not because they are stupid but because they are forbidden and also their intelligence is destroyed at young age. There were many many examples of such. 
I kept them all on USB sticks which I kept on my body at all times. I erased the trace off my computer every single time I signed off. I also created a document within a document so that my notes looked like a school material. I also created a back up copy on SD card which I hid in secret places in the dark, with the light off, just in case there were camera in the room. 
Hi, for now at least, I would not be allowed to go back, but more than that, even if I were allowed, which I could be in the future, I would probably not go because it would be too dangerous (in a different way than when I was there undercover for the book) and also because I would not feel that I would learn anything new, unless it could be under a different setting, which would be nearly impossible to find for the moment. And yes, there are more books at work:) Thanks for reading.   
Generally it's the same. Yes, the accent is different & they have some phrasings and words that are different or feel quite old fashioned or war-related vocabularies, but in general the difference is almost regional where one has that in South Korea from region to region also, but when you are talking about the basic exclamation you cite, (when bumping into things or surprised) they are pretty much not that different. 
Only those texts allowed in China. All that was pre-approved by the North Korean authority. I tried to install my own methods of essay writing and letter writing to investigate what they are really thinking, but that was not a part of the official text, but I insisted and got them approved by the North Korean authority called "counterpart". 
You know. . .I don't really know. I could give all the usual answers how I was so tortured by the injustice there -  which is true - and how I felt horrified watching so many separation that happened to families, including my own - which is also true. But the answer is a far more complicated one. So I recently wrote a long essay on this very topic for Lapham's Quarterly, which should be coming out any day now. So I will tweet that out when the piece comes out. I think it has something to do with fear. How that society is built on fear, and how fear can dictate us, and how we try to fight that fear in life. . .I know it's maybe a bit nonsensical in this AMA answer format, for which I apologyze. . .but the more accurate answer would be that I jumped in there because it was the most scary place in the world for me. . .if that makes any sense. 
The average citizen is unlikely to have any access to the "outside world" on a day-to-day basis. However there are smugglers that bring SD cards, CDs, etc. into the country with forbidden material on it such as western/south korean movies and kpop. 
I am always torn between the two genres. But if I really had to choose, I guess my heart is with fiction. But nonfiction makes my brains flow perhaps in a really exciting way. And my nonfiction in general is literary that I get my fiction angst/fill through that way. I don't know which I "like" writing better. Writing is so torturous for me that it's only after finishing it or nearing the end that I can enjoy it:) No, I do not consider myself a Korean-American literature writer. That genre is an odd one for fiction writers. I guess one cannot help that in coming up with genres, but especially fiction, to be limited by my nationality or immigration history is uncomfortable. I guess I just want to be a "writer", period. Yes, The Interpreter -- so many years later, I myself still have a real soft spot for Suzy Park, so thank you.  
I think the biggest misconception goes back to the basic premise. Most Americans have no idea why there are two Koreas, or why there are 30,000 US soldiers in South Korea and why North Korea hates America so much. That very basic fact has been sort of written out of the American consciousness. By repackaging the Korean War as a civil war, it has now created decades of a total misconception. The fact that the US had actually drawn the 38th Parallel that cut up the Korean peninsula, not in 1950 (the start of the war) but in 1945 at the liberation of Korea from Japan is something that no Korean has forgotten -- that was the beginning of the modern Korean tragedy. That the first Great Leader (the grandfather of the current Great Leader) was the creation of the Soviet Union (along with the US participation) is another horrible puzzle piece that Americans have conveniently forgotten. 
I dont know about cannabis, but I have heard from several sources that meth use is common as it is much cheaper than food, easing stomach pain from starvation, as well as provides energy for a long and tiring work day. I would also like to know the OPs comments on this and if its true.  
The whole idea for the literary nonfiction on North Korea came in February 2002 when I first went to Pyongyang for the 60th Birthday celebration of Kim Jong Il & wrote the NYRB cover essay. I realized then that an essay was just not enough, and there was just so much more I felt about this topic, also given my family background etc. From then on, it was trying to study the topic as thoroughly as I could, by literally researching it from afar and close, i.e. following defectors through the defection route, interviewing separated families, and situating myself in places where I could either go to North Korea or learn more in-depth stuff about it. Even my Fulbright research grant which allowed me to live in Seoul for 14 months in 2009 was for this book. As well as each visit that allowed me to get a different perspective. Understanding it from all sides was a key, and I felt that I had exhausted that by the time I lived there in 2011. So all in all, I would say about a decade.   
It was an unpaid job. I believe every teacher was sponsored by their church. There is not a danger in teaching in North Korea, but this is a gulag nation, and America is their enemy, and there is no diplomatic relations between them, so if you are a teacher from  the US, then, yes you are in danger, as evidenced by the recent hostage crisis where two American detained by North Korea (currently still held there) are from the university where I taught.  
There are Americans and other foreigners teaching English in the capital so I would think English is OK. Also, there is a lot of Western tourism that again requires English in the capital 
I wasn't there to teach, so that was not what I was looking for. My students were so busy, every hour of their day was mapped out, so it leaves no time for thinking. I found that world to be without hope. That does not mean that there is no joy in moments. There are because human beings are resilient, and my students were very, incredibly humane and lovely and their youthful spirit was sparklingly beautiful. But there was no real time for them to celebrate any of it. They would relax a bit but the immediately hauled off to their many duties that all had to do with regime & great leader. There was no hope there. So I wrote down what I saw. But I do not know about other teachers who were there to teach, but if you read my book, you will see that the other teachers weren't mostly there to teach but there as a part of their fundamental evangelical missionary purpose. 
I can answer this if you like. PFC - Pyongyangs answer to KFC. Was a nice break from the Kimchi. 
Learning the language of the enemy could probably get you recruited as a spy, allow you to do business overseas for the regime, etc. 
Since our videos are advertiser friendly, it hasn't hit us too hard directly.. but it was part of what prompted us to build Floatplane Club so that we and other creators would have ways to make money in the event that our adsense revenue got ripped away.. so it's definitely costing us money, but only because we're re-investing what we're making. 
Well I'm getting some now, so that should give you some idea :p 
Firetruck unboxing video. I wouldn't even hate it so much if it didn't have more views than all of the GOOD STUFF I've ever done.  If it didn't make so much money in adsense from 5 year olds just watching "the next suggested video about firetrucks" I'd pull it down. It's an embarrassment. 
I personally really like Kickfarted but not every kickstarter product we order is spectacularly bad enough to feature in the series, but we will probably revisit it.  
7 Gamers 1 CPU was one of the most exciting projects I've done. I'll always remember the moment it worked as one of the highlights of my career.  That's really where I get off - spending a TON of time on something, not being sure that it's going to work, and then seeing the end result be awesome.  Scrapyard Wars Season 1 will also hold a special place in my heart forever. That was where we began experimenting with the idea of being a "Tech Top Gear" rather than just a review channel and that path we took continues to shape our content (even our reviews which contain more personalities and funny stuff and more little sketches than ever) to this day. 
Yeah Dennis and I were both really pleased with it. 
This.  I found it really jarring in the final episode of the last season where you had the team talking about finishing their benchmarks and then instantly it changes frames completley and Jay is starting to review them. Then after about 5mins the winner was decided and it was over.   Seems a real shame to have this 3hour or so build up, only to have the big reveal over in about 10mins.  
Probably at some point and so much has changed so there is a lot to show :)  
He wants to make this stupid nonsensical movie that is just actually dumb. This was an idea he had 5 years ago and he still wants to do it.  Super cheese fest with stupid techy nerdy junk. 
I think Berkel holds the record for most expensive stuff broken... He got out of his chair, which caused the air shock to spring up, knocking over a 34" LG Ultrawide back when they were brand new (about $1500US iirc).  I was also (somewhat) responsible for taking our Sony FS700 out for a shoot in the rain (Brandon LET me do it, so it's partly on him). It didn't work for a few days and we had to disassemble it to the greatest degree we could to dry it out.. Scary times. That was in the early days when we couldn't have afforded to replace it :p 
Yes. I highly recommended Linus brand cable ties. They are available in any colour and style you want as long as you want orange with my face on it. 
So when Luke, Linus, and I would drive from NCIX late at night on Fridays (we would carpool) the conversations ALWAYS went:  1) Are we friends? 2) Linus Media Group is a stupid company name.  This went on for a few months, without fail. 
TV.  Or I guess our own platform, Float Plane Club. 
reading positive, supportive comments like this one.  I also love spending time reading stories to my kids and playing with them and playing badminton. 
Being up in Western Canada makes collaboration a little tougher.. and I'm pretty asocial by nature so I haven't generally gone out of my way to "collab" - especially because many collabs are just blatant subscriber swaps  "hey sub to me and sub to him/her and get a chance to win"  But I've also known a lot of the people in the tech tuber scene for YEARS and really enjoy spending time with them. So it's nice to have an excuse to hang out and make a video.  I'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though. 
Eventually, and completely. It will be it's own building.  
Depends how the first one goes.   If we lose buckets of money, then no.  If we lose a little bit of money, then probably.  If we break even or make money, then GAME ON! 
I WANT THE WIRELESS LOGITECH MICE. DO YOU HEAR ME, LOGITECH? GIVE THEM TO ME. 
We will be making a video about that very soon :P  
My favorite camera currently is my Fuji XT-2, IMHO its the best stills camera I have had the pleasure of using day to day  
I prefer 'guided' where you have an arc planned out and you have the meat of what you want to say written but it's not word for word  
I suck at it :p  But seriously, I have no social life, so it's just work/family, which makes it a bit easier. I get one night a week to go out and play badminton and other than that I go home and spend time wiht the kids. I've also SIGNIFICANTLY cut back on the time I spend working on the weekends. So it's not too bad at this point. 
I want to make a movie trailer.  Not a movie.  Just a trailer.  But with BADASS high production values so it would be a TON of fun to shoot. It'd be basically a bunch of sketches back to back without having to deal with the boring parts of making a movie like real dialogue and a story arc and character development.  I just can't figure out how to fund it other than stealing $100,000+ from the LMG coffers and putting it in a firepit... 
It's not that I'm not spending time making content, it's just that I'm involved in OVERSEEING the process rather than actually DOING it.  
For most of us at the start, it took a lot of hours, low pay (so Linus could afford to keep us going), and corner cutting. Actually, it sounds like not much has changed. Nevermind.  For my hire so far, and the people I hire in the future, I don't really hold chasing fame against them. Motivation is motivation. 
I am, I've been very busy with other projects and there are a lot of windows only apps that I need so I will likely be splitting my system in half with unraid.  
one of them is literally fused in there.. I"d have to cut it off. So... no... 
LOTS of things... If I ever stop making tech videos, you'll see them. 
Ehhhh kinda but it's easy to regret things with a project like scrapyard wars. Its an insane wrap up of rapid fire decision making and prioritisation. By design not everything will go perfectly.  
I'm trying to make sure that they don't. =) That's my job. 
They are Maxine's nails she is the newest shooter on the team  
'We're a media company that makes videos for the Internet'  
That's actually the sentiment every year when looking back. 
I want the NVIDIA Shield Portable to get updated. It's frickin awesome.  As for tech that needs to stop.. Fitness trackers need to stop or start being accurate. As it is now they're just jewelry imo. 
They were broken down and put in the pile. A lot of the stuff is engineering samples so we can't sell it or give it away, but it's still functional so maybe we'll find a use for it. 
No. I am seriously considering going to school part time for project management however.  
EveryFrameAPainting, WiseCrack, Nerdwriter1, Philip Defranco I have a huge respect for all those guys.  
It's growing much faster than expected, I'll still be around tho!  
No plans. Trying to recreate the magic of an earlier video by making it again is rarely a successful formula. 
t'would be lit af, but no plans for that at the moment. I don't want to mess with the purity of Nicky V's vision 
I get to smell him on a daily basis. Sometimes he doesn't notice and sometimes he just pretends not to notice.   So far, the same amount. XD Things don't get easier, we just try to do more/different things  
They can call it "Linux with Linus (but not THAT Linus)"  
There are positives and negatives to both but ultimately where we are now IMO is better than its ever been in many ways.  
Put all my parts under mineral oil then it failed to post. I fixed it.. But Damn..  
Its dope, they do a lot really cool stuff with blocking and composition and I liked that they try to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality.  
He doesn't really wanna answer our stupid questions 
New shows and ideas are a constant thing that we think about so always looking to do new challenging ideas. Keeps life interesting  
Knowing Linus they will be able to go down whatever path they want and he will support them ferociously.. As long as it's productive, has any possibility to succeed.. And isn't being a stripper.  
Tech for the sake of tech is lame.  I kid. Gaming is awesome. 
HELLO FRIEND.   It doesn't offer nearly the range of capabilities that we plan to offer. This is the short and simple answer. FPC isn't just early access video. More will be clear on launch. :D 
The end game is to make videos with people I love working with.  And no I want NOTHING TO DO with physical inventory. I played that game. It's no fun. 
Tech is great that way. There's always something new - sometimes great and sometimes terrible - to get excited about or crap on. We're really lucky to have so much inspiration. 
Actually quite a lot. If someone here feels strongly enough about an idea it will be questioned and examined but generally if they persist they will be allowed to do it.. Thing is I'd the audience doesn't get on board  fairly strongly you'll just never be able to do it again. Which is fair. Its actually quite a lot of freedom, ive taken advantage of it a lot and don't take it for granted.   
I have a video review on the RED 8K Helium cameras that we got, should be on its way mid July  
Infrastructure is doing very well. Design and front end Dev is not. We are quite a few months from launch because of this.  
Very sobering.  "Oh wow my life has changed".  I had to sit down and think about what my life would be like going forward.    I am responsible, to a large extent, for the success of the NERF dart gun line.   Yes 
High performance dart guns were originally based on my patents.  I hold them in high regard. I'm a nuclear engineer, and engineers aren't known for their humor. 
I went and gave a talk at a school, years ago, after the Super Soaker first came out.  I told them that I had invented it, and they didn't believe me.  I left the school with them never really accepting the idea that I had invented the water gun. 
Backpack tanks or hose attachments might be the peak 
Jammin' Jet.  It was commercialized.  It was a water propelled airplane that was pumped just like a Super Soaker with water shooting out the back, propelling it into flight.  The manufacturer changed the design of the plane to fly in a circle, but didn't adjust the wings so as it turned it would roll and dive into the ground.  Usually causing the plane to break after the first launch.  Exciting toy, exciting commercial, disappointing in the end. 
I got the idea in '82, had a number of false starts, and it wasn't until '89 that I made the presentation to Larami.  It was on the market a year later in 1990 as the "Power Drencher".  We changed the name in '91 to Super Soaker and because of the consistent sales success in both years by word of mouth, Larami decided to run TV commercials. In 1992 it became the number 1 selling toy in the world. 
Your friend sounds like a douche lol. Always gotta 1-up, huh? Supersoaker was pay2win lol  
I wouldn't phrase it that way.  I would phrase it as hard-ball, hardcore business. One would like to see businesses operate more on principle as opposed to what they can get away with legally. 
I have worked with and been funded by the Department of Defense in the past for my inventions. It's probably better that I not comment on the specifics of those contracts however. 
I went to the toy store one day and saw a number of guns being sold under the N-Strike name, and my royalty check did not reflect the number of guns I saw in the store. I took out my contract and did a close review.  Inventing energy converting technology and batteries that will be 2x better than lithium ion. 
Having high pressure and a relatively large nozzle.  However, as you go to higher pressure and the water comes out faster, the stream breaks up in the air and limits how much further the water travels.  There's an optimum combination of pressure and nozzle size. 
I once used a Super Soaker to unclog a plugged up water drain at my home. 
I wanted to be an engineer long before I knew that "engineer" was the term that described what I wanted to do.  I was tinkering as a little kid.  Always curious about the way things worked. Since that time, what I've done has been to be persistent.  So perseverance and continuing to hone your skills is the key to being successful in anything you do. 
The monster was the largest gun that Larami produced.  It was very badass in its look.  But the seals around the nozzle had manufacturing defects that were not corrected, and it did not deliver on the promise that the appearance presented. It was a dual nozzle version of the CPS 2500, and would've been great if it worked as well as the 2500. 
I have in the past.  We used to routinely get them when we were focused on improving them and redesigning them.  But at this point in time I'm not really active in that sector. 
I really appreciate the compliments people give about the water gun. It makes me want to do more to improve quality of life.  I'm hopeful that my new technologies will help improve more lives.  In fact, the heat pump that I was working on when I got the idea for the Super Soaker was being made to address an environmental problem. 
Yes and no.  I do have a display of Super Soakers and I have a display of prototypes we built over the years.  My collection is not complete, there are some that got away.  Periodically I'll go on ebay to find ones out of production, and some are stored away to protect them. The room in the background of my proof picture is the prototype "museum" we have at my laboratory. 
When I made the Super Soaker I was trying to make a high performance water gun.  The desire to make a high performance water gun occurred when I was shooting a stream of water from a nozzle I hooked to a bathroom sink while working on an air conditioner that would use water as a coolant instead of Freon. 
I have an invention on the Galileo spacecraft which went to Jupiter, and my fellow engineers at JPL were skeptical that it would successfully solve the problem we ran into.  It went to Jupiter in support of a very successful mission. I also invented an engine that converts heat into electricity more efficiently than perhaps any other engine and it has no moving mechanical parts. Super Soaker remains what I am most known for. I am confident that history will be kind to me. 
That never occurred to me that people would do that with a water gun, but my philosophy is that everyone is an inventor.  Everyone has creative ideas, and hopefully most of them are productive. 
I could be wrong.  It'll stick around, but I suspect it'll go the way of the hula hoop. 
Yes.  Eventually JTEC technology will mature and become widely used. The nuclear community is very conservative with respect to implementing new technology and want to rely on the tried and true.  But eventually the performance of the JTEC will warrant its use in nuclear applications. 
One of the keys to success is realizing that there are many things that can go wrong with a given idea, but my strategy has been to develop multiple inventions to put the odds in my favor. Also to persevere.  It's important to know when to quit, I'm just not very good at it. 
I knew it would be successful because I knew it was a fun toy, but I didn't anticipate it to be a number 1 toy in the world.  That's not something one can predict. 
I had one that would be a great Super Soaker in a water war. It was a rapid refill model that when you ran out of water you put the nozzle up directly to a water source and it refilled your gun automatically. 
I was designing space craft before I was designing Super Soakers. That being said, when you present a really innovative idea the general reaction is usually skepticism if it is something they are not familiar with or have seen before.  People don't usually accept radically new ideas readily. 
The Super Soaker and NERF allowed me to pursue the other projects that I'm working on.  
First off, you can't make money unless someone knows about it.  Secondly, I was willing to put my idea out there and to lose as long as I learned from the experience. I felt that subsequent ideas I had I would be able to use that experience to become successful. 
No.  I asked for $50s and $100s only.  Everything I'd understood about bait money was that they only came in $20s, so nothing to worry about there if you specifically demand the other non-$20 denominations.  And I wasn't worried anyone would see me getting into my vehicle because I parked out of view (i.e., on the other side of another building). 
I didn't tell my wife or my best friend or anyone.  I didn't want to burden either of them with that.  But that's not the real reason I didn't tell them.  I just know that your chances of getting caught skyrocket when you start blathering on about it to others.  I didn't feel like it was a dirty secret either.  It was just one of those things that I did every now and then.  I'm a private person, so it didn't bother me keeping it to myself. 
Not a lot.  The most I got from a single robbery was maybe $7k. 
I put a lot of thought and planning into the first one.  I probably spent five months obsessing over all of the details, possibilities, etc.  Once I got the nerve to finally give it a go and everything worked as planned, it was pretty much copy-and-paste from then on.  I didn't scout banks, per se, but I did have an idea of what I was looking for.  I didn't want to hit a stand alone bank.  I wanted to be able to park my vehicle within walking distance yet out of sight from the bank (i.e., on the other side of an adjacent building).  As for the best times, I usually opted for some time around 3pm since I figured that's when shift-change would likely be for the local police. 
So my first AMA pretty much went viral and a gazillion people reached out to me for this very thing.  I ended up meeting a really great producer who is doing a documentary type film, and I can't wait to see what he does with it.  I don't know that I'm at liberty to say much about it, but he is awesome and I'm glad I met him.  Hopefully will have some news on that soon. 
My 10 y/o self was trying to cope with his parents divorcing and not understanding how to fit in at school.  He wouldn't have listened to a damn thing I said anyway and probably would have done the exact opposite anyway.  More than anything, I think I'd just tell him to hang in there and things won't be bad forever.  I'd tell him that his parents still loved him even if they didn't always know how to show it, and I'd challenge him to actually try to appreciate school instead of trying to make it hell on every teacher in his path.  10 y/o kids don't have a fucking clue in life and are in that really awkward phase of *too young to care for themselves* and *too old to have everything done for them*.  I'd probably tell him to become a hacker. 
First of all, I am standing up while typing this and there's nothing you can do to stop me.  Nah, I can't imagine ever wanting to do that shit again.  I like my life, and I'm happy.  That's something I never had for the first few decades of my life.  There's just no appeal to do certain things as you get older and for me, this falls into that category. 
This is a fun conversation to have, and I actually will have a really cool opportunity to go to an event later this year and talk with banking professionals about it.  I'm excited.  Cameras are a shit ton better today than they were in 2006.  Plus, we have social media in a way that only existed in our worst nightmares back then.  It's a lot different these days.  With that said, it's still just not really that big of a priority for banks to catch robbers.  They're not really losing *that* much money to robberies.  If you do it how I was doing it, you're not going to really raise any eyebrows.  On the other hand, if you're going in guns blazing and wrecking shop, they're going to put a lot more of their resources into catching you...  ...because if you hurt a customer during a robbery, that's going to cost WAY more money than a few thousand dollars from Teller B.  And I agree with your last sentence. 
Depending on which type of table you're talking about, it could be as simple as opening up the table and getting it out with your hand.  Most coin-operated tables that you find in bars/pubs/whatever have a split-cabinet design so the owner can open it up and remove the coin box.  If you're talking about a home model that doesn't have a split-cabinet design, it's going to probably be a pain in the ass. 
I never really felt like I was looking over my shoulder.  That feeling usually only lasted an hour or two after the robbery, but it was pretty...I dunno...whatever a drug does to you is what it did to me.  But as with drugs, it wears of more quickly each time as you build tolerance to it.  I didn't really feel like I was living on the edge.  It was exciting, but it never lasted. 
Damn right, it is.  And not just because of the crime, but just because of being a felon in general.  Although it's technically illegal to discriminate based on that, companies aren't so quick to hire an ex-con.  Thankfully, it's still America and there's always opportunity if you try hard enough.  No complaints from me. 
I stuffed a rag into the drain of their sinks and turned on the faucet so the house would flood.  Other than that, no. 
If I saw an officer of any kind, third party or not, there's no way I was sticking around to rob the place.  So your presence alone can prevent a certain amount of crimes, I'm sure.  The downside is the people who don't care you're there also do not care if they have to hurt you.  At a glance, I think your comment kind of sounds like you're probably in the wrong business.  That sounds so stressful. 
I think about some of the tellers often.  I don't really know what I feel about them, but I do hope they don't have any kind of PTSD or other resulting issues.  And if they ever wanted to get me in a room with mediators or whatever and give me a piece of their mind or whatever other things they needed to do, I wouldn't be against that.  I guess the answer to your question is no, I don't feel guilty.  But I don't feel the opposite of guilty either.  I just don't feel a lot on certain topics.  I don't know what I would even do with those feelings.  I'm open to suggestions. 
Probably.  I don't know.  I don't think I'd want anything to do with that crowd. 
I've never seen that movie, but generally speaking, Hollywood tends to really get bank robbery wrong.  Granted, if they painted a more accurate picture of bank robbery, it would be terribly boring and nothing people would want to pay to see.  Hollywood portrays bank robbery about like the porn industry portrays sex. 
My sentence was 36 months.  I served 39 months because I didn't get credit for all of my county time.  I think you misread the proof.  The crime carries *up to* 20 years, but that wasn't my sentence. 
She was terrible.  She's one of the few people I mentioned by name in my book.  She was just a terrible, terrible person. 
I graduated high school and never went to college.  That was about eight years before the crime stuff.  I think there are lots of things that could have changed my path somewhere along the way, but it's hard to say exactly what they might have been.  As a parent (especially knowing my own history), this is something I think about constantly, and I wish I had a better answer for you. 
I do think about the tellers.  There's not really much I can do about the impact my choices had in their lives, but I'm open to anything that would be productive in the matter.  I hate to admit it, but I really just don't feel a lot of remorse.  In a lot of ways, I've grown a bit detached from who I was back then, so perhaps there's some denial at play (or some other kind of psychological explanation), but I do think about those folks and if there's anything I could ever do to resolve any issues that arose from what I did. 
I was expecting more like a decade or so.  I wasn't really sure, but I definitely expected way more than three years. 
Only problem would be if it got on news it never did.  He would watch his back for couple hours, after that he would relax until next robbery. 
No, it never happened.  And I don't really know what I would have done.  I probably would've just been like *Ah bummer...ok, ttyl.* 
I don't think anyone was in shock.  I don't think anyone predicted or anything like that, but I don't think there's many things I could do that would raise the eyebrows of those who know me best.  I guess I could be tried for other robberies.  But then again, so could you.  That's pretty much the level of risk I'm at by now.  It's been 10 years.  It's all good.  Thanks for the well wishes.  :) 
I don't fully know how to answer it.  To me, it's like asking someone why they prefer mustard over ketchup.  I just don't like mustard, I guess, but I can't explain why.  I just don't like how it feels in my mouth.  To me, there's a certain *icky* feeling about selling drugs, stealing cars, robbing convenience stores, or any other crime.  Also, I knew how banks worked.  I knew their procedures during a robbery, so I was just more comfortable with the thought of doing that instead. 
I was too lost in my own spiral to really worry about jail.  But yeah, most of the fears people have about jail/prison are pretty comical once you've done time. 
he said the banks never pursued him because they didnt lose much money and because no one was threatened  
Inmates are damaged long before they're incarcerated.  It's not normal for mentally healthy, functional people to do things that land them in prison.  So just understand that the people you'll see have pasts long before the crimes they're doing time for.  People in our culture forget that criminals aren't just born.  Nobody pops out of their mom and is immediately bad.  Things happen somewhere along the way that help shape them, for better or worse, into the person they become.  For balance, I'll say that it's also important to not simply have sympathy for inmates and only focus on the terrible upbringings they may have had.  You have to be able to simultaneously see them for who they are, what they've done, but also where they come from.  Prison is a dark place.  There are some things you just can't prepare for.  Just don't forget that everybody has a story.  And with some of those people, you hear their story and can't help but think *My god, no wonder you ended up here.* 
Dave is the coolest dude ever.  Seriously.  I'll box someone for talking shit about Dave because the dude is just really exactly the same guy off air as he is on air.  He ain't just putting on a show.  He's the real deal, just another redneck who cares and happens to have a lot of money too. 
u/Ninjaassassinguy is correct.  I don't really know what they could have done to spoil my plans aside from things that were out of line with what they were trained to do. 
How dare you try to trick me into finishing my 4th grade homework.   ^^And ^^sorry, ^^but ^^I ^^have  ^^no ^^idea.   ^^Definitely ^^less ^^than ^^minimum ^^wage ^^though. 
Nope.  I don't think I've ever been above the third story of any building in Austin. 
Hell if I know.  I think my only realistic choice at that point would be to leave. 
No, I don't think it's a gateway crime.  It's probably near the end of the list of things criminals want to do but are too scared to try, for whatever reason. 
Because its easier to give money to him than take a risk and have guy runing around bank with weapon. 
I don't think I'd have been alive much longer.  I was really in an bad place mentally and emotionally, and I didn't have that give-a-damn thing that makes you avoid really bad choices.  I don't think I'd have taken myself out intentionally, but I wasn't really making decisions based on my well-being. 
The grand heist is sneaking an extra house or two onto a lot. 
While the media goes off on the idiot Trump-Russia witch hunt, the real damage is quietly happening on this front.  The enduring, horrible legacy of Trump will be the dissolution of public land and monuments.   Forget the Russia tangent; if you push too hard, the right will bring up the bribes by the Russians to the Clinton Foundation  
**THIS**, so much this.  Toured up the West Coast with open roads through all the Federal lands and beachfront with nary a sign of barbwire or private properties for hundreds of miles!!  What, you mean just pull off the road and camp on a beach like it's your own back yard?  Exactly like that, and it's like nothing else I've experienced.  Freedom exemplified.  East coast touring, not so much.  In fact, not even close.  Hundreds of miles of barbed wire, pastures,  no trespassing signs, paid lodgings, lakes, grounds, everything privately owned/pay to stay and keep on moving to the next hotel.  Truly two very different sides of a single coin. 
Sounds to me like it might just be good old fashioned nepotism?   As a kid I worked 2 or 3 weekends a month on a small Colorado ranch. We neighbored a dude ranch that owned a small acreage surrounded by NFS land. Accessible only by NFS roads. The NFS land was considered some of the best hunting in the area.   Because the dude ranch was in good with the local ranger they got him to close off all the roads and give them a key. Officially it was to "prevent erroision" but everyone knew it was a favor to give the side ranch private access and hunting.   I will say this was the exception. Most of the management done was honest. One bad ranger in charge of this area...  
I would like an answer on this as I have mixed feelings about it.  On paper I think it's awesome. But atleast in my part of the country it seems like everywhere is cultural, spiritual, or historical to native tribes. Its not just like an acre where they buried their dead. Its chunks of huge square miles. 
Sure!  Just outbid the companies looking for the raw resources.  But seriously, the selloffs happen in huge parcels that are open to anyone.  Most people just don't hear about it because they don't go looking. 
Good question. Groups that back land transfer, like the American Lands Council and the Mountain States Legal Foundation, have received funding from industry groups. MSLF has received money from Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, U.S. Steel, the Coors foundation and ExxonMobil. The American Lands Council, which has employed Utah state rep Ken Ivory, has received funding from fossil fuel interest/Koch-backed ALEC and Americans for Prosperity.  
The federal government isn't requisitioning these lands, these are lands that for the most part were never claimed during the Homestead Act and never left the possession of the federal government   
Hey! I'd love to hear more about the eminent domain issues where you live. If it's about federal mismanagement of land, we might cover it in this series. If it's a national story but not right for this series, I'll pass it along to another editor. Thanks for your time! [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com 
Cleats, for sure. Who doesn't want to be The Flash? 
Seems sort of futile to me, aren't Republicans against Federally owned anything? 
You need to include ranchers in that. They're a big, big part of it. 
Learning a little about drilling operations would be a good first step in understand what actually goes on in the aftermath. Even the terrifying looking oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada look roughly the same post production. From the wells I've been part of, the impact is negligible. The process of selling mineral rights to private oil companies and the like has been going on in Texas for years. It's really not as terrible as this man would suggest. If you'd like the basics "A Primer of Oilwell Drilling: A Basic Text of Oil and Gas Drilling" is a reasonable place to start. I know I'll get downvoted for saying this.  
You would need millions to buy a national park plus the money for upkeep. 
The biggest reason against the states controlling public lands at home is the cost, and the reason that 70% of previously transferred public lands have been privatized is all about money. States aren't supposed to run a budget deficit like the federal government does, and when the cost of fighting fires and maintaining public land gets too high, the state sells thousands of acres to private interests to ease that financial burden. /u/Caty_Enders may be able to speak to that a little better, though.  
Hey, thanks for this! On my way out, but this is a question that I answered more fully in a few other responses. In brief: Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and the Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Partnership have made a huge impact this spring 
Budget.  States have budgets to keep to (so do the federal government, obviously), so a "good" way to do that is to sell off the land to private ownership, which is what has happened to the vast majority of the federal land that has been transferred to the states.  
Side note, I misunderstood until I read your twitter feed. Unless I didn't. So to add another question to the mix, who is this land going to? Where is it coming from? Aka is it Public parks people use and enjoy, or just unused, undeveloped, unknown? 
Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2   it's in the constitution, also Kleppe vs. New Mexico for the Supreme Court's opinion on it 
Hey, thanks for reaching out. If you'd like to chat, you can reach me at [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com 
Jus to note, it wouldn't giving that land back to the states.  Federal land in the West with few exceptions never belonged to states in the first place 
Federal land = purchased by the federal government, and usually managed through BLM or the National Parks Service. State land = purchased by state governments or gifted to them by the federal. As enshrined in the Constitution, the power of the federal government supersedes that of state governments. States should certainly have the power to decide what to do with the lands that they own, but the federal government has the power to decide what to do with the land that they in turn own. I'm addition, if a state is mismanaging its lands in a way that is to the detriment of multiple states (for example, pollution that runs through rivers to other states), it's the federal government's responsibility to step in and protect these lands, in order to make the will of people in outside states that are being affected known. 
is it even remotely possible for any intelligent human being to not have a personal agenda on saving the planet ? including our protected lands?    i mean.......? 
The problem with local governments owning these vast tracts of land is mainly that they cannot afford it, so after a few years they sell it off.  
Because it takes away a lot of public space that's enjoyable in its own way. There's a lot of unique land rivaling the national parks out west that could be forever lost to private interests and blocked off with"no trespassing" signs. 
Those lands are the property of the federal government, which it acts as an environmental steward over, why would it give up property to the states 
We saw a bunch of fish that I had no idea what they were! We also saw some whales. The first time we saw a whale we rowed in circles for half a day trying to follow it and get a picture.  
It is absolutely the most amazing thing you can ever see. The stars were so bright and numerous that I would just stare until my neck started to hurt. We also rowed through bio-luminescent plankton which was mindbogglingly beautiful.  
It was not fun..I did try to swim after each shift so I could at least get some of the sweat off! I also washed my clothes a couple times a week with freshwater so they wouldn't get crunchy.  The first shower on land was pretty amazing! 
When we found out the storm was coming we tried to row as far south as possible to miss the worst of it. Once the wind was strong enough in the wrong direction that we were not making any progress we deployed our sea anchor. A sea anchor, or para anchor, is basically a parachute with a hole in the top. You put it out in the water and it hovers ~50-75 ft away from you below the surface. It keeps you perpendicular with the waves so you are less likely to roll and it also slows down your drift. Once we did that we hunkered down in the cabins until the storm passed! 
The hardest part was when we got caught in weird currents and would row as hard as we could and get pushed backwards. It happened when we were only about 400 miles from the finish line! We were so close to being done but we just couldn't move!  We had one tropical storm hit us that turned into a hurricane! It was scary not having weather radar because we really didn't know what to expect. We had a satellite phone so people gave us weather updates but we really just had to wait and see what happened. it ended up not being that bad but it was a little scary.  
Our boat had 2 emergency EPIRBS and our lift raft had 1. The race made sure that we had all of the safety equipment and training we needed! 
Honestly I don't think it really sunk in until we lost sight of land. That was when it finally felt real. Then we just kept rowing until we saw land again! There were some times that rowing got really tough and I just wanted to be done. We hit a weird current that was pushing us back East and we would row for 24 hours and stay in the same spot or lose a couple of miles. It was really frustrating!  
Since it was a race there is a sailboat that tries to sail around the entire fleet in case someone needs help. Luckily we never needed any help. If you get assistance of any kind you are disqualified from the race. I didn't think I was weird after the row but my family and friends said I was really spacey. They said it was hard to carry on a conversation with me because I would just start daydreaming.  
We rowed 3 hours on 3 hours off. So one was rowing while the other was sleeping. Basically you would just wake up, get dressed, eat something, start rowing, finish rowing, change your clothes, eat something, sleep, and repeat.  I did have to run the water maker every day around noon to make our fresh water for drinking. We mostly ate freeze dried meals and a lot of Costco bulk snacks! 
Whales, fish, dolphins, no sharks (thankfully) I think I would have been too scared to swim if we had seen sharks.  
Do it! It will seriously change your life. If you want some inspiration watch Losing Sight of Shore...it's on netflix!  I was never scared for my life but I did get a little nervous a couple times.  
Thank you! I really appreciate it.   The race organizers had a "first meal" set up when we got back and it was a burger and fries! 
We had a very complex Garmin system called NMEA 2000. This included our GPS, AIS (which pings our location show we show up on other ships radar), wind/weather info, and navigation.  We used the GPS a lot in the beginning because there were several small islands close to the one we started on and we wanted to make sure we didn't get to close. After that..we pretty much rowed west/southwest and went with the wind.  If our electronics had failed we did have a handheld GPS that we could have used for navigation but it would have been very dangerous to be out there without an AIS. Since our boat was so small the big cargo ships could hardly see us. If we didn't show up on their radar there is a good chance we could have been hit.  
I don't feel like I was spacey but I do remember feeling overwhelmed by all of the noise.  
Oh, definitely! At one point my spotify playlists stopped working and I was left with two albums and some audio books. Lets just say I have those songs memorized. Sometimes I would count strokes..1000 would be about an hour. Definitely did a ton of daydreaming!  
Wow that is really embarrassing! I don't think I can change it either. Whoops. I guess I was nervous and typing fast.  It was weird being in a tiny boat but I think we got so used to it. Then when I watched some footage of our boat in the water it looked like a tiny toy! 
Thank you! I love my chacos. We definitely did not think about the foot setup enough before leaving. When I do another one I would mount those foot straps like wind surfers have and also get something comfortable for the heel. My feet were too small to fit comfortably that is why I had to wear the sandals! 
I trained for about 2 years leading up the race. I was rowing in college at the time so it was easy to stay in shape. For the southern Atlantic (East to West) the best time to start is in December. It is the time with the fewest hurricanes. East to West Atlantic is also probably one of the easiest routes. It has one of the most consistent currents and trade winds in the world.  No Disney release. Just a few YouTube videos for now! My arms are still pretty strong and it has been a year and a half! 
So this is kind of embarrassing but we both had really weird songs that we loved. I was a big fan of Celine Dion's "That's The Way It Is", "Jack Sparrow" by Lonely Island, and "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy Joel.  
I'm not sure! I know I definitely sang super loud but I don't know if George got it on camera. We both just belted songs out. It was one of the only ways to stay motivated. I also have "We Didn't Start the Fire" memorized now! :) 
I rowed for 3 years in college on a club team so I had some experience. We did the row as part of a race and a lot of the people on other teams had never rowed a boat before in their lives! There was definitely a wide range of people from hard core athletes to every day people and everyone ended up making it across! 
We kind of had our personal time during our rest hours when the other person was rowing. We never really got sick of each other because we didn't actually see each other that much! 
1. The race takes place in December-February because this is the time with the least hurricanes. 2. Our goal was to finish in under 60 days. We made it in 58. 3. We had emergency beacons, a satellite phone, and a lift raft if shit really hit the fan. Maritime law would be our friend..any boat that is able to respond to a distress call has to. 4. I lost 20 lbs. I had put on a lot of weight because people scared me and told me I would look like I was starved. I probably didn't need to put on as much as I did. 5. Definitely! My back was so strong.  6. We had a bucket for our toilet. We used biodegradable wipes for TP.  
We took 75 days worth of food. We had 3 freeze dried meals per day and lots of snacks! Our snacks included: trail mix, cheese its, goldfish, granola bars, candy (m&ms, snickers, hershey's), poptarts, mini muffins, and various other munchies. The snacks were mostly just calorie fillers and not meant to be very nutritious.  
Sorry I missed this comment earlier! It was definitely a little freaky swimming for the first time..but the water felt so good that I quickly got used to it! 
We both put on way to much weight before the race! People made us nervous that we would lose like 50+ pounds. Girls on average lose only about 10lbs..the guys lose quite a bit more!  No naughty time was had. We have always been just friends! 
Thank you! I've always loved the ocean and I saw a YouTube video of 4 guys from the UK that did it. Their video was so inspiring that I really got motivated to do my own row.   
Yes! We arrived in Nelson's Dockyard/English Harbor. It is the finish line for the race now so every year there will be a whole fleet going in! 
We tried to do 2 hrs on 2 hrs off but realized it was not enough sleeping time. We both felt pretty comfortable rowing for another hour and thought it was worth it to get that extra hour of sleep. I do think we lost a little bit of productivity in that third hour but since we weren't concerned about racing it worked out.  
Thanks! Yeah I had never heard of it either. People have been doing this since the late 1800's! Some people did it in an actually wooden rowboat..like with no cabin or cover. I don't understand that! Modern ocean rowing boats started in the 1990's. The race started in 1999 and has been going every year since.  
That's awesome! GAP is the best. Not much here. Getting pretty sleepy.  
There are basically two boat builders out there for these special boats. One is in the UK and their prices vary from ~20k-50k. We got our boat from a new company that just started a few years ago. They are in Port Townsend, WA and are called Spindrift Rowing. They are super cool and did an amazing job with our boat! Ours was actually the first American made boat to cross an ocean so that was really special!  
We had a pretty uneventful row in terms of equipment failure, weather, or injuries; which is definitely a good thing! I think one of the worst things that happened was we had downloaded a bunch of playlists of spotify so they would be available offline without wifi..and about 30 days in all of the sudden they were unavailable! Luckily I about 20 songs and my audio books left..but rowing 12 hours a day..20 songs is not a lot!  The next row I want to outfit the boat with better cameras! I feel like we missed filming a lot of cool stuff because we didn't take time to set the cameras up. I also would bring fruity candy! I surprisingly got sick of chocolate and probably would have killed for some starbursts or skittles.  
Hmm.. I'm a big fan of Remember the Titans, The Guardian, Lord of the Rings, actually..pretty much anything! I'm definitely not a movie snob. 
I flew home with my family from Antigua to Minnesota (it was freezing).  It was a very strange feeling. The finish was amazing! but we had spent almost the last 3 years of our lives planning this journey. Every spare moment was dedicated to it and then all of the sudden it was just over. The first few months back home were pretty tough for me. I really felt kind of empty and not sure what I wanted to do with my life! 
Bored: yes, lots of daydreaming was involved. Listened to music, rowed, listened to audio books, slept. We did a lot of wiping off with freshwater and baby wipes to get the salt off.  
1. Sponge baths with fresh water! Lots of baby wipes! 2. dryness like our skin? or the boat was always wet? I don't think we can fix the boat thing..it's just too humid! 3. Definitely! There were very un-athletic people in our race. 4. I do not think you would want to row for 8 hours. Your butt would be dead and you probably would be barely moving by the end.  
This is honestly my first time! One of my friends who is on here a lot told me that I should do an AMA because he thought people would be really interested.  
um... rowing. I mountain bike a little, I like fly fishing and hiking also.  
I think we got a good base tan being in the Canary Islands for two weeks before we left. We also had spf 100 that we applied every time before rowing.  
I would say a week or two? The first few days were pretty rough but it slowly got better. 
I would love to! I am not a great writer but I think it would be awesome to get all of the memories down while I still have them.  
We actually did it right after we graduated college. I graduated in May and worked a summer job..George graduated in August and then we left in December. 
We went by 5500 calories per day. We also had some hydration tablets that we put in our water. I think if I do more of these I would definitely meet with a nutritionist. I did notice that my pee was very neon green and my nails got very weak. I lost about 15-20 pounds on the trip! 
We watch a youtube video actually! Damn interwebs.. 
I cried twice. Once when my music broke and the other time I can't remember why. 
We did! We had about 5500 calories per day. Three freeze dried backpacking meals per day and lots of snacks! I would have killed someone for a pizza about half way through.  
No we weren't, we were about in the middle of the pack. We decided we were not as concerned about racing and just wanted to enjoy the experience! The first place team finished in 35 days and last place was 96! Everyone made it and we were actually the first fleet to have all boats finish! 
Thank you! Yes, we took turns sleeping. 3 hrs on 3 hrs off. Sometimes on my daytime off shifts I would stay up for a bit and chat. I also would run the water maker and get the meals ready for the day. At night it was pretty much switch over, eat something, and pass out. It was pretty amazing how fast my body adjusted to the schedule! 
No sharks but we did see a few whales, lots of flying fish, a lot of normal swimming fish, dolphins, and some barnacles on our boat. 
Not very often. My boss told me I need to get a shirt that says "Ask me about my ocean row" 
A couple fans would have been nice! Fruity candy, more seat pads.. 
Thank you so much! I enjoy letsrun. Rojo and Wejo have done a great service and made a wonderful resource for runners.   Oh, YEAH! I would love to see people like Jordan Hasay and Allie Ostrander get more attention, I'd love to meet them and watch their meets. I think it should be more of a spectator sport. I love watching running, I don't know why people don't like watching track and field...people just don't get it, I guess.  
MysticadelaSierra Hi.  I'm glad I inspired you.  Because it is you that just inspired me.    I thank you.    Stay true to yourself and everything will fall into place.  Don't let  other people make your decision on what and when to be happy.  Please don't let the unkindness of others stop you from being a good person at the gym.  I know, I know..Please continue towards your march of health.    The fitness is 80 percent in your kitchen. I found that out.  I have had a       
By the way...thank you so much! I'm so glad you're a runner...the running community can be so wonderful and supportive. :) 
I am Mi'kmaq, my tribe is in Maine and Nova Scotia! My kids are Mi'kaq and Chickasaw. I just recently was in Santa Fe speaking at the W.I.N.G.'s of America Coaches Conference, at the American Institute for Indian Arts. I love to go to reservations and talk to an encourage kids. I've been traveling since my daughters was 8 weeks old, she went to her first reservation in Bemidji, Minnesota, we went to Red Lake.   I'm so glad you have a group!! 100 milers...WOW! That's so awesome. It's so necessary for our communities to be active. I carry diabetes and heart disease in my family, it's such an issue...we need to be proactive.  
Hmmm...good question...I am a toe-striker when I run, so I had a lot of foot and lower leg problems. Achilles and plantar fasciitis were common with a lot of the people I ran with. I struggled with that, too. Shin splints...my hubby had a stress fracture in his navicular bone that he had for ten years. Those are pretty common as well.  
A lot...I married my husband Danny 25 years ago, we raised two kids. Before that I had my own store...owned a restaurant. I skiied. I was a massage therapist and a nutritionist...I worked as a nanny for a wonderful family. Lots of stories, lol! But the past few years were being a stay at home mom and proudly homeschooling two kids.  
Good question! I was just reading about Craig Engels this morning...love his hair. Hmm. I liked both runners, they both ran with heart, I have so much respect for both of them.   When Danny and I first got married, he had a ponytail, lol! I'd have to say long hair...I still wear it down when I run.  
Thank you. My daughter raven has a lot to do with the introduction.  She's my girl!  Yes, my running career.  I have a long term goal. but right now the short term is taking precedent.  Strengthening feet, ankles and lower legs.  I haven't thought about keeping track.  Hmm. Good idea.  
Thank you.  CIAO!!!! :)  For a young athlete..play.  Play, play, play.  Keep it simple.  Have fun.  Learn the basics and when you do you can apply them to any and all sports.  Soccer is super for body strengthening.  Exhaustion.  Know it well.  I'd say sleep, but being overtired one can not sleep.  When I was training I had to teach myself to shut down and I had to learn to sleep.  Crazy.    Now I meditate .  Yeah, I had to focus and I try to meditate everyday.  Five minutes a day.  It's nice.  MY daughter wants me to do Tai Chi.  So I think I'll take her up on that as It's better for me to have movement while letting go and be within...(sounds good huh).  Also I have found that certain foods help calm the body and sleep won't be too far off.  Chick peas, bananas, walnuts, almonds.  I personally will have raw local honey with chamomile tea with cheese and crackers.  I found the above helped me a great deal.  I suffered ...insomnia... 
I loved running so much, and how it made me feel, that by not going out after work for a drink with my coworkers, I didn't miss my run. I used to go out every night and drink Schlitz...I didn't let other people dictate my happiness. My run and the feeling I got during and after my run was the most important thing. I wouldn't let anything or anybody jeopardize that.  
I didn't, really. I ran with a group of guys. I've run with a group of guys. I just trained like a marathon runner, a long distance runner, not like a woman.   But...there are differences. Women are still behind in heart care. A paramedic would probably think I'm a corpse, I have a resting heart rate of 43. But ultimately it's individualized, its hard to speak for all women on this subject.  
Yeah, I've read articles about that too. I don't know. Personally I had kids late, and I'm thankful I had a healthy body and could have my kids in my 40s. These days (I'm 64), I want to get back to top-class, back to my top form, and I don't know where it's going to take me, but I'm reading everything I can and pulling out everything I know.  
I identify with you. It's hard to start and restart, it's just really hard. Stick to it, that's my advice. Be consistent. Set a goal for yourself, even if that goal is just running for fifteen minutes without stopping. It takes time, and you may get frustrated, but if you stick with it, you'll see progress.  
These days, more or less. I listen to Spotify. The whole neighborhood does because I hate headphones, lol.  
Hi. Thank you!  I was inspired to race the Boston Marathon by the group of guys I saw at the Quincy Y.  I started running March 28.  The Boston Marathon was in April. Listning to their "war" stories I wanted to do it too.  One of the guys said I had to qualify for the Marathon.  Hm, I thought I had to run a marathon to prove I could do a marathon..hmm.  OK...But the guy planted a seed by saying I didn't have to worry about qualifying time because the women had more time allowance.  A few months laater I entered the Ocean State Marathon in Newport, RI.  I ran my first marathon after a few months of running and losing 52 lbs.  I qualified for Boston by running a 2:53:40.  Under the men's standard.  (hehe)  Not planned at all.  I thought for sure I'd die of a heart attack during the race.   
Try changing your shoes. It sounds like you need to change them. Shin splints are usually caused by tight calves and toestriking...I'm a toestriker.   I would stretch before you run, especially your calves. Try dropping your heel on a step, 30 seconds, 10 reps each leg. Flexible shoes are key.  
That's so great! I used to go in front of the Y, all the way down Wallaston beach, to the Squatum Guard shack. Sometimes I'd go out and do the bridge, out and back. The police had their fire range out there, I think.   They didn't have my event in '80, so I didn't even have the Olympics on my radar...I knew my distance, and I knew I was a marathoner. And yes, I did try for the '84 team, I got 16th at the trials--to me, I just wanted to be on the line, I was tickled that I got to the trials themselves. I don't have any regrets. I wasn't raised with the Olympic attitude...everything I did in my career, I did to try and recapture that feeling I had in the locker room shower of the Y. 
I know huh?  Well, if I thinking about something, it'll pop in my head...and answer will soon follow or a justification will suffice.  Usually back in the day, I'd play out scenarios.  The "what if" game.  But it usually comes down to just relax and take note of what is going on.    Now, lets see.  I did a two hour run a couple weeks ago.  I picked a beautiful country tree lined road.  Rolling hills...very early in the morning.  I think I saw only 3 cars.  I ran in the middle of the road..sweet.  So yeah, I fantasize about achieving my goals...and WHAT IF THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED!!!  What would I DOOOOO! 
Good for you..a month.  Way to go.  Keep it going.  It takes time to build up to be fast and to be fast while going long.  TIME TIME TIME.  Be nice to yourself and take the time to build.  You will reap rewards. 
Thank you deusos!  Well, hmm fave fruit.  I eat lemons because it my favorite that my body needs.  My favorite to eat just to eat is...drumroll  KIWI!! 
I ran in the late seventies and early eighties.  I had heard of blood doping.  At the time I didn't know what it was.  And didn't know anybody who did or was doing it.  It was after when the stuff was made public that I understood it.  And no, didn't know anybody who was doing it.  Our "drug" of choice then was 120-150 mile weeks. As it probably is now.   
LOL! I never did. Other people did that for me. I always just accomplished things for me. I was very goal-oriented, and what other people said or thought about me didn't matter. My times were my times, and I stand by them, it didn't matter what gender I was or what ethnicity. They were good no matter what.  
No, personally. My recovery was an easy run. I didn't run on treadmills or in pools...if I couldn't run outside, I didn't run. Low impact exercise can be good for maintaining fitness through an injury, though.  
I loooovvvee Toffifay. It's a hazelnut and caramel candy and it's delicious!  
Goals.  Goals. Goals.   Little goals, stepping stone goals are important, I find.  At times the long term goals make for being overwhelmed.  And fear can set in .  Believe your goal.  Doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about it.  It's yours to make.  It's yours to own.  It's yours to work towards.  When the time comes, you may not reach the long term goal..but it won't matter because you did everything you could do to reach it.  It's the process...not the end result.   Ok, I know that may sound like a "get out of jail free" card...but it's the striving and making do with what you have.  You neva know what you have until you try. And that's where the work begins.    When you try there is NO FAILURE! 
I'd start by not running fast in the beginning of your run.  Think of how far you would like to go.  The pace you start with are you able to hold the pace for the length of time you would like to run.  One of the best ways to build endurance is to run consistently.  Take it little by little. Time will be your friend.  
I suppose I do. though I have not had it in eons..not any ice cream for that matter.  I lead a sad life. 
The first time that I actually acknowledged that I wanted to do something in regards to distance and time was between my first marathon and my second marathon...they were a year apart. I did a 2:53 in my first marathon and I thought for sure I'd do 2:40 in my next marathon. (I did a 2:47 and I was bummed.) I had a whole year to train...I took the winter off though, because I didn't like running in the cold.   That was the first time I became aware of time and speed. Otherwise it was just run until I couldn't run anymore, and then get up and do it again.   Good luck on your powerbuilding!! :) 
Really...no...really?  Huh?  Why?    Sad..."another one bites the dust.." 
Well, when I was under contract I went through quite a few (FREE).  Seriously though shoes at the time were good for perhaps a month.  Training and racing shoes.  Now I think it could be about the same.  For me, I go through a pair in about three months or so.  Right now...it's ok.   Yeah running will do it for you.  But if you can't run, don't give up...take the time you have for running and use it to walk...Many times a person gives up physical fitness because they gave up the time to something else...me included.  I have reclaimed the time.  If I can't run I don't... I walk.  Puppy boy needs to get out to run in the fields with his buds.  We have two other dogs. 
HI!!!!  Wow!  Ah, my mom was from Antigonish.  Beautiful.    Nice plaid, too.  I did have a skirt at one time but now I have a scarf. 
Oh wow, you have a goal...TERRIFIC!  More than half the battle.  ya'know it sounds like to me, that you need a transition period between getting home from work and going out for a run.  As to tips for speed.  I was strong.  Strength carries speed. I wasn't fast iin the shorter distances until I got stronger to hold a certain pace for a shorter period of time.  Over the course of a marathon strength is what  helped me through.  Push ups, sit ups core work...can't beat it.  When you are so tired, look towards what you ate during the day.  Too much caffeine, not enough water, too many carbs, brain tired, haven't kept the runs fun.    Change it up.  Change a course. Change the time you run.  Remember to keep drudgery to a minimum.  You have a wonderful goal.  Keep it wonderful.  Have fun enjoy the process.  It's real.  I look forward to you celebrating the end of June...with another running goal....yeah, I know, I know...that's how it works  Good Luck 
HI!!!!!  I attended Quincy College when it was a community college...for hmm, I think three semesters.  Notice I mentioned attended..lol  You're an Aries.  I do not know whether to congratulate you or send you a sympathy card ;) LOL!!  You are head strong. You poor dear.  Though it makes you determine.  People called me obstinate, stubborn  ..I called it "stickittofness".  And you will spit blood before you let go of a goal.  So make the goal...and go for it.  You'll have fun..because it's fun. 
Pretty awesome to answer the questions.  It's a broad spectrum  of questions.  Makes me think and helps put things in perspective.  My running was so long ago, but today it feels like it's happening right now.    The best questions...I don't know...I don't have a best.  I like it.. 
I share with Wilson. We have a good trade. He eats the skin/fuzz, I eat the fruit. :)  
She's half mikmiq (Canada First Nation Indian. Her mom ran away from Nova Scotia)  yeah, so she's not "100%" Indian.  When I read the headline, I assumed she was Native American.  She could of mentioned that in her bio. 
So funny story- there's this machine we kept in the back, right, called the Hate Engine. We have these siphons right underneath the desk that suck up all the complaints to add to the Hate Engine, and the Engine converts that hate into more money, which is why they keep adding service fees. More fees = more money = more hate = more more money.  Seriously though, nobody paid me to be a fan of Ticketmaster's practices. This whole ticket monopoly situation is kind of fucked right now. Best lesson I learned at the job was to always buy from the venue directly when I can. 
It doesn't really work that way anymore, unfortunately, at least according to my experience. A lot of it's the usual "get in early and get lucky".   With casino tickets specifically, though, there is the VIP angle to consider. Good casinos reward their players really well, and for us in particular we had presales a day before public sales just for our players. Also, depending on circumstances we'd sometimes get tickets back from our VIP folks for sale if they just weren't doing the numbers they expected, which would lead to some last minute openings- usually in the primo seats too, just because the VIPs get the good stuff to keep them coming back. 
Yeah, we used the old-school DOS-ass TMWin99. When I was training people I always said it's like using a program written in Swahili or something- you can learn a phrase or two and learn your way around to do some basic stuff, but beyond that it's really tough to figure out unless you've been doing it forever. It's a lot of rote memorization and repetition, which takes new guys a while to figure out. 
We still sold in house, we just used an in-house ticketing system that worked in tandem with the room reservation system before (I think it was called Showgate) and switched to all Ticketmaster in tandem with a major remodel about two years back. The difference in show quality was noticeable- we were getting good shows before, but we jumped from D-listers on average to B-listers. No Taylor Swift or Metallica or whatever, but still a lot bigger draws that pulled in a lot more sales. I'm willing to bet a lot of them got on board because their agents or record labels or whatever work exclusively through Ticketmaster. Like it or not, they opened doors. 
Here in Tampa at Amalie arena it is definitely worth it to go to the box office. You save on all the convenience and print at home and whatever else BS fees.   
Our venue did music and comedians mostly. Before we renovated a few years back we'd have amateur MMA live, which was interesting, but also tricky to handle since the theater wasn't designed for that sort of setup (since all the seats are on one side and whatnot).   The stage was actually enormous, which gives a lot of room for some of the real showmen that have come through (Alice Cooper, Empire of the Sun, and KISS come to mind) to work with cool set designs. 
In person it was free, $3 extra per over the phone. Recently they added a $2.50 fee on top of that to everything, no clue why. Still dirt cheap in person. 
I haven't, golf was never really my thing. Went to the arcade as a kid and tried a bunch of the restaurants during my time there, though. 
It varied a lot- show days were almost universally busy, whereas any day that wasn't within a few days of a show was slow as hell.   I had days where I didn't speak to another person all day long, and then I had show nights where I sold nonstop for hours straight and on-sales where we didn't stop selling until we closed. 
Could be.  What if Amazon, Google, or Apple decided to enter in the ticketing industry?  All could afford to just throw staggering amounts of money at the problem to make up for their lack of initial services.  They could bankrupt TM in short order.  Non-massive companies?  Nah, not really.  Consumers tend to see Ticketmaster from the perspective of a heartless entity trying to bleed them dry.  Ticketmaster clients (venues, promoters, etc) _love_ Ticketmaster because the available services available as a TM client are literally not available anywhere else.  TM has no real competitors for the upper end.  You need to get down to the "club" size where your Eventbrites and the like are very competitive, because the clients just need something super easy and quick. 
Turnover at the box office isn't as bad as something like the front desk, which was nonstop *and* dealt with complaints *and* was high-visibility. As far as management, I liked my direct superiors a lot, but more than a couple steps up the chain I didn't really hear from anyone. That could be a whole lot worse, but it wasn't great either. 
Allllll the time, dude. This is a throwaway so I don't wanna be specific, but a lot of gaming subs. 
It's still there, dude. Saw it a few days ago when we ate backstage for my little going away party. 
I can't speak for anyone but myself of course but man, I think she can go fuck herself. Heard from one of my bosses at the time that she was being an asshole to the people working at wardrobe and all that too.  I'm sure she's probably nice to some people but that was a pretty dickish thing to say. 
It varies wildly depending on the show, location, venue, all sorts of stuff like that. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that super popular acts sell out instantly.  From the angle of this specific venue, the casino and presales are what take the lion's share. Casino gets a couple hundred tickets at various price levels to offer their players based on their play rate (and I've seen players with an average daily wager rate from the single digits to the thousands), sometimes five or six hundred if it's a big show. Beyond that, our presales were pretty open so a lot of times the a good chunk of the front half would go before the on sale. At a guess, that means about thirty percent of a theater seating about 2500-2700. 
1) Interestingly enough it's likely that Ticketmaster splits a portion "their" fees with the venue, promoter, etc (however rarely the artist) as incentive to keep using Ticketmaster. That way everyone involved gets more money, TM gets the client/venue, and TM gladly takes the brand hit for having fees that are too high and not the other parties. They're so used to taking that brand hit, coupled with their market dominance that it's baked into their business model.  How do I know? Not telling. 
I have heard that, yeah, but it wasn't really true for our venue (max fee total outside of online was $5.50) so I don't really know how accurate it is, sorry. 
Swing/night shift for three years, then morning for the last year. Given that my new job is normal business hours, I'm glad I had time to adapt.  I was part time, but for awhile we were really understaffed, so I did more hours including a lot of overtime pretty frequently. 
Seventeen bucks and a free coupon for the local McDonalds.  Honestly I have no clue. We used Ticketmaster for our sales, we weren't actually Ticketmaster. 
Not at all, honestly. I'm not a very outdoorsy person. Tons of people come through the casinos for that stuff, though. 
Actually, I just told another couple stories on another comment higher up. 
A looser refund policy. Ours was "no refunds unless the show cancels" so there were many times where something happened and people couldn't go and we couldn't do anything about it, which sucks for everyone involved. 
It's been updated all over the place, man. If you're in the area it's good stuff. 
No clue man, ask TM customer support I guess. Might be a mailing list you can opt out of. 
Honestly I have no idea. You'd want to talk to an entertainment director or promoter, someone who works directly with third parties to negotiate the sales. 
Depends on the venue. If it's high demand, you've got more people going after stuff quickly, and you're more likely to get a shit ton of scalpers. That's kind of indicative of the sorry state of ticket sales at the moment, and there really isn't much we can do about it on our end either. 
Nope. Policy says "charge this fee in this circumstance". Can't really do anything about it- I didn't make the rules, I just followed them. 
My best guess is it's U2, they're hugely popular, so tons of scalpers got to it. 
I actually went to school for design, and left this job because I got one in my field. I enjoyed the ticketing side and interacting with customers (most of the time) but I never wanted this to be a career, just a way to help pay through college. 
They're not too bad on our end, actually. I know the bell guys hate them because they smell like shit, all their bags are covered in dust, and they stiff them on tips all the time, but for shows they're usually super chill.  We had Thievery Corporation come in for the burners one year in one of the pavilions, right? Our setup down there was two computers, two ticket printers, and two card readers, and it was just me and my boss at the time running it. We got down there and no printers worked, no card readers worked, and only one computer worked. My boss literally kept running back to the normal box office to print chunks of like 500 tickets to bring back while I was punching cards in manually and giving out tickets from a stack. Despite this, none of the burners cared about having to wait in line, they were super chill and let us do our jobs, which turned a nightmare into a manageable show. 
No, but I got a cool little keychain dongle. It says I Slept With Satan And All I Got Was This Cool Little Keychain Dongle. 
It depends on the size of the venue. We attracted some good talent, but none of the absolutely enormous acts that fill entire stadiums, so we never really had that problem. Kind of fortunate in that regard, really, since casino already gets a chunk of the good stuff, so with no scalpers buying stuff up fast there was still plenty for everyone else. 
Don't think so, I was using TMWin99 the whole time. I know the management system Ticketmaster One or something was online, but I was never a manager so I only saw it once or twice. 
If the venue charged what the scalpers charged and they still bought it up, what's stopping them from selling it at even more of a markup? 
$10 an hour, but it's okay because I got sexual gratification from being an unwilling cog in a machine far greater than any individual change I could make in order to pay my way through college.  Venue was a nice place to work, customers were good, liked all the people I worked with. Doesn't mean I like Ticketmaster. It's better than the available alternatives, but that's because they're all worse. 
Actually Disney totally left us alone, we did what we wanted. We got one note from Michael Eisner that said "love the show, could use more history" (EG) 
We actually haven't yet seen it. I (EG) just saw the documentary Bill Nye: Science Guy and loved it. I laughed, I cried.  
Never imagined the success of the original show. We talked about the show being relevant for 3-5 years, max. Almost 25 years later, to have so many millennials say they got into science from the series is so amazing to me.  And just a shout out to Mike Green, composer of the theme song.-(jm) 
Thanks - we were never approached though always happy to help out (eg) 
Good question. Bill leaned more to education, we leaned more to entertainment, a constant battle so to speak. We always felt if they are not having fun they will tune out.  Bill kept us on point with the message. We always tried to present different ways to learn, I (EG) got the most out of the sketch/humor parts, so I always leaned towards that.  Bill always had great real world analogies. There were times we felt a show might be a little flat and then it went thru audio post at Bad Animals and we were always cracking up in the final review. 
On camera, Bill played the Science Guy.  Off camera, Bill was Bill Nye, human- one that loves, laughs and is passionate about what he does.  To be on camera, you have to push that personality.     
Bill was very much influenced by Mr. Wizard. When it came to the production of the show we were very influenced by MTV sports and the PBS show Square One television. 
We were as surprised to hear about this as anyone.  We actually found out about it through Reddit comments.  We have no idea who did the edit. (jm) 
As far as I know, nothing flip-flopped, if anything he seems to have become more political. We totally support his stance on climate change. (eg) 
Oh man, that's so long ago, I don't remember. We had a great writing team, Mike Green and Tom McGurk did the music. I loved so many of the music videos in fact we had a whole episode with them. It was The Top 11 countdown - because 11 is a prime number (that's a Bill thing)  EG 
We all worked together at KING-TV in Seattle. There was no picking. It just was. (EG) 
Probably not. I also wished I was related to the Gottlieb Pinball machine empire. (eg) 
Absolutely. I majored in Film and Broadcast production and minored in Environmental Science - and when i grew up I wanted to do environmental documentaries....so years later i'm on the set of BNSG and a friend taps me on the shoulder and says - you know you are doing what you always wanted to do. I didn't even realize it at the time. (eg) 
That it continues! And my favorite educational show on right now...you mean other than Biz Kid$ of course, I'd say Arthur, still an all time favorite. Make sure to go visit the BizKid$ website and take a look at what we are up to nowadays! www.bizkids.com (EG) 
Hey there! To answer your question, he was born into it. (eg) 
You went on to be a scientist because of the show?  Thank you!  That was the plan.  We were working on the idea of a financial literacy show for years called Financial Genius.  We met our Canadian partner, Jeannine Glista, with her idea for a show on kid entrepreneurs called Biz Kid$. Now, we do about five stories on kids and their money per episode, all wrapped around one general theme.    So many kids think they can't do this, but when you see where some of these kids come from and the ways they are building their financial futures, it can be mind blowing.  Some have become multi-millionaires.  And I think if these kids can do it, anybody can. (JM)       
Like a proud momma!  That is one of my favorite quotes as well as is "keeping shaking science guy the sapphires fall to the bottom" (eg) 
I would absolutely love to see some statistics on the effects of the show.  We hear from someone almost daily about how the show impacted their lives and they made a decision to go into a field of science because of it.  That is very gratifying. (JM) 
It took weeks for a show to come together.  We shot the show in segments and would usually shoot segments for three to five episodes over the course of a single day.   If we were in the field, for example, we might be doing something on reptiles in the morning and rivers in the afternoon.  We generally shot on the main stage on weekends because it was when our science kids were free from school. We could usually do the lab scenes for two shows over a weekend. Offline usually took three weeks, online was a week, audio post went another week. (JM)      
The original Disney Presents Bill Nye the Science Guy series had very little negative comments from the scientific community.  At the time, we tried to do the best research our budget allowed.  We had a team of qualified young science researchers and a broad based science advisory board.  We did our best with the information available at the time.  Now, of course, there is this thing called the internet... (JM)     
The pilot episode of our series was funded by a Republican administration.  The series was funded by a Democratic administration.  This is one of those important discussions we should have over a beer. (JM)   This is not a one beer discussion. (EG)    
You realize these guys have nothing to do with "bill bye saves the world" right? 
They already said Bill, because Mr Wizard is already dead. A bit harsh, though scientifically accurate. 
That's not a bad idea. Get your foot in the door. Learn everything you can on the job. You can start working on your own show for cheap - shooting stuff on your phone. (eg) 
1. At KING-TV, we worked together. 2. The food. Jim went to one of the baths with one of our hosts and enjoyed it so much he went back the next morning and didn't realize (couldn't read the sign in Japanese) that they switched the male and female areas and next thing I hear are ladies' screams.... 3. Yes, it was an effort to not have the education overwhelmed by the humor/entertainment. We did have one rule of the road that the science was always the science and no faking/drama. 4. Probably my parents, even if I didn't want to admit it. (eg) 
Pat Cashman is the "What?" guy.  The character was created by Jim Wilson, audio designer, at Bad Animals studio.  They were always filling the show up with sound.  A lot of that sound was an attempt to make us laugh and we encouraged it.  One episode, at the final mix, a scene goes by where Bill says something a little complex.  There was a brief pause, we hear a deep-voiced "What?" and fall over laughing.  Almost immediately we start getting scripts featuring just the voice!  We quickly decided that only Jim Wilson could place Pat's voice.  (JM)  
I was an associate producer for the first three years of Almost Live!  I gravitated to John Keister's stuff and tried to help him every chance I could.  One sketch I remember was called Hydro Hijinks, about the hydroplane races we have every August here in Seattle.  In our version, it was actually local Norwegian fishermen trying to catch salmon faster with boats that exceeded 120mph.  Another sketch was Keister's Lifestyles of the Almost Rich and Famous, with Robin Leach.  In John's version, his fortune was made selling Amway.    We did a reunion show of sorts with a series we called the [206].  I just missed doing a show in front of a live audience.  It was a blast. (JM) 
Bigly. When we started the series we had one of the first Avid edit stations (non-linear editing) and one of the editors said he felt he was editing with mittens on. We don't shoot on tape anymore. For a while there we had to remember to brings drives to off load the media. You can probably shoot way more than you need cuz you aren't going to run out of tape. Today, getting your show on can be as simple as posting on youtube, I guess. (eg) 
We were very Influenced by MTV Sports. We also thought if we were getting bored of a segment - we'd switch the channel for you, so we threw in static and abruptly cut to the segment. We also had an awesome edit team. (eg) 
I wouldn't call it censoring as much as updating it to fit the way scientists think of gender nowadays. Also, it's been made clear in othet comment chains that Netflix didn't edit the show: when they got it it was already changed.  
oh now you're having me go way back into my past (eg) 
We touch a little on economics, but I think you may be right.  Possible new series idea? (JM) 
Bill, most definitely. And we built the show around him. (EG) 
Scientists aren't 'accredited'. Part of the whole thing is anyone, anywhere, can be a scientist by simply following the scientific method. There is no accreditation board where you earn a title and it's not regulated the way claiming to be an MD or JD is. Would you consider the mythbusters scientists, that's also primarily engineering. 
Sex and gender are different things, scientifically speaking. The quote is about gender. 
We are currently putting our efforts into Biz Kid$ and appreciate your comment. (though we never say never) eg 
I didn't intend to portray that.  And Bill, to my knowledge, has not claimed to have a PhD. (JM) 
Thanks for the question. I would say we were very strongly investing in MMOs in the late 90's/early 2000s and we stopped that side of the business because it wasn't performing well enough and we should have continued on with that. 
Hi! Splinter Cell is a brand we talk about a lot. It's also personally one of my favorite series. We don't have anything specific to share at the moment but teams are working on different things, so stay tuned for more.  
Hi there, that's a good question. I think yes and no, we have encountered some problems recently and we have some work to do on improving our services. It's a tough learning experience but I think we are progressing well. At the same time I'm very proud of the games we've released over the last few years and the success of live games like Rainbow Six Siege, The Division, For Honor, The Crew and Steep I also am incredibly proud of what we showed yesterday at our E3 conference. 
To expand on this question, what games from other companies have helped inspire you and drive you to create better games for the consumers?  
Hi there, it would probably be decisions about which projects to persue and which ones to cancel. Telling a team who've been focused on a project for several years that they won't be able to  continue it is very tough. However what I have seen is when we do cancel projects it is almost always for the best, it gives us an opportunity to learn to refine our ideas and come up with better games.  
I would love to hear an answer for this.  Siege is such a special game, it deserves more love from the finance department.  As a follow up question, have you been surprised at the growth and dedication of the Rainbow Six Siege community? 
I love it! It's the first time that we have seen that level of engagement and passion around a game we've created.  
To become a CEO I would say pick a fast growing industry you are interested in, surround yourself with the best and work hard! 
I would say Far Cry 3 on the Xbox One X would be amazing :)  
It's tough to choose by I would say Assassin's Creed because it gives me an opportunity to explore history. But I love all our games so it's very tough to pick. 
Hi there, first things first I read them! I very often dispatch and share them with our teams with my comments and I think they help us prioritise what we need to fix and get a good insight into the biggest concerns of our communities. 
We have to go where we can find the best talent! We're always looking for very talented engineers, so I would be happy to open a studio anywhere we can find great people :)  
Guy that was heading the story (I don't remember his name) left the company some time ago. Starting either with Brotherhood or Revelations it was basically axed and is not coming back. 
If you see me on the booth please come say hello!  
Thanks for the question! At Ubisoft what we try to do, when we can, is take ideas that people have and then try to make that 100% of their job. For instance Star Link which we announced yesterday came out of a Game Jam we had in Toronto and we were able to make that into a full project, For Honor was also a passion project that we were able to turn into a reality. And it has happened for many games we've published over the years! 
As video game creators we have the fantastic power to anticipate and build games that allow us to experience what the world could look like in ten years-time. Playing these games is a way to test and learn and this I believe  will have a positive impact on the world. 
I think streaming will be the next big thing, but it will take time before it is ready. Streaming will totally change the way we create and play games, and will again positively disrupt how we think about gaming.  
I would love to hear an answer for this. I Loved The Division despite its bugs/exploits. The Dark zone PVP was possible the best I have ever played when everyone was legit. Wish the player base on PC didn't dwindle to almost 0 =( 
For us the world, systems and the gameplay mechanics are key to building a great game!  
1. Swiss Dark Chocolate! I always have a stock on my desk for long meetings. 
Just wait, they said they weren't interested in Egypt a few years back, but here we are. 
I thought it would be big, but not this big. What is amazing with this industry is that technology is always giving us fantastic new opportunities to disrupt different genres and segments of games and to create new ones. I believe interactive entertainment is the future of entertainment, and we still have huge opportunities in front of us.  
Thanks very much, it's great to see such a positive response to our conference. My dog's name is Buddy!  
Ubisoft uses Ubisoft games to originate ideas. They've had some but not a lot of original ideas I would say. 
AMAs work of you ask one question. If you want to ask another question, post another question.   Flip the coin and now you're the one answering the questions. Do you want to answer ten different questions from ten different people, or ten questions all from one person? 
Recent Ubisoft games (Watch Dogs 2, Ghost Recon Wildlands, Steep and probably some others I forgot) were not downgraded at all compared to the gameplay footage shown before release. So I think you can expect Far Cry 5 to look like in the gameplay trailer. 
They'll probably roll out updates for both PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. It doesn't make sense for them to only do so for one platform. Same way as how the PC versions have been getting better graphics than both console versions, which will continue. 
IIRC It's called a "hostile" takeover as it's without the owners' approval, only the shareholders giving it a OK. 
Because they give us free dlc like rainbow six. They are the first one to push this model and they gotta make money somehow 
Nobody really knows for sure. He was found washed up on a beach and didn't remember anything before that. He might be the only creature in the world he inhabits not to have originally been dreamed into creation by Polokus. 
Thanks! Rest of the answer below on your second question. Duplicate.  
I was goingto do a gym in Manila once but I was always going to do one in Thailand for sure. Its the mecca and Phuket is the heart.  
Hey bud thanks! I got into fighting after watching The Karate Kid.   My gym in Thailand is called AKA Thailand. You can see more about it at AKAThailand.com. We are building it to become the largest gym in the world so its still a work in progress but moving fast.  Luke Rockhold and Javier Mendez have been out here training but not DC yet. He trains full time at AKA HQ in San Jose.  
Hey Reion, it was when I realized that I couldn't put 100% of myself into the fight camp and fight. I started setting myself up for a post fight career early and that just grew and grew so for the longevity of my life and future, business is just the best thing for me right now.   There is no issue with the language barrier at AKA Thailand or in Phuket. 90% of the people you interact with will have some understanding of english or speak it natively. Its a very diverse location due to tourism. 
Thanks Hussain! I have so many favorites now. My teammates at AKA of course.... Cain, Luke, DC, Thomson, Khabib, etc... As well as so many others! I like the fighters who go out and put it all on the line and go for it. Thanks for the kind words! 
Thank bud! I kneed a guy's tooth out after he was beating up a girl and threw a punch at me and then my friend threw him through a plate glass door. My friend was Christian Wellisch, who also had several UFC fights. He always got me into the shit, since I was the smallest bouncer. Oddly enough, I never get into street altercations, but my bouncing days were crazy. 
Hey bud, it can be many reasons. I can attest to the fact that you really do miss the fighting itself. The walking out, the fans, the mixing it up, and of course the winning. I think its just hard for fighters to realize when they are too old to do their best.   For me, I am happy and content in business now and operating AKA Thailand. I live vicariously through my fighters and enjoy their highs without any damage to my already damaged brain. ;) 
Thanks bud. Yes they measure us themselves. We go through very rigorous medical testing as well. UFC fighters are some of the healthiest athletes around.  
I can't speak for the other gyms but I custom built this gym from the ground up for 2 years making sure it was perfect in every way. We hold the exact same curriculum as our headquarters in San Jose and have had an amazing run of success in just 3 years. I don't think you will find a more clean, friendly and modern gym in this entire part of the world. Don't take my word for it, check out AKAThailand.com and scroll to the bottom to see what some of the biggest names in the sport have said about it. ;)  Email Info@AKAThailand.com, ask for Marc and mention Reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount.  
My fight with DaMarques Johnson at UFC on Fox 4 was my most memorable. I had 910 days out of competition and was still not well and it was a huge stage being on the main card on FOX. It was a war 1st round but I got the KO in round 2. ;)  I think most memorable was coaching Mark Hunt to his UFC victory over Bigfoot Silva.  
I see the "bare knuckle" Muay Thai events here in Thailand occasionally, but they actually do use rope over their hands. I don't follow actual bare knuckle boxing.  Best thing about living in Thailand for me is just having the gym in such a beautiful location and interacting with such awesome people that come in from all over the world.   Worst thing is that Thailand does not have a Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, In 'n Out, or some other of my favorite American eateries. 
Yes we do all types of training packages. Check out AKAThailand.com for more info.  
We actually get a lot of requests for this! I was actually in talks to do a gym in Manila before I finally built AKA Thailand. Never know...  
Yea he is a stormtrooper and much respect to him for breaking out and taking himself to a level none of us ever dreamed possible.  
I agree totally with putting kids in Martial Arts but not to defend themselves. I think its good for discipline and respect.  
Absolutely not. Most of the guests we get are not fighters at all and are just either looking for a good workout or to have a fun experience.  Email Info@AKAThailand.com, ask for Marc and mention Reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount. ;) 
Lmao no one who went to Clear Brook is better at anything from it 
Check out AKAThailand.com and then email Info@AKAThailand.com for all info on our packages and sponsorship info.  
Yes I own a big print shop in Northern California but I don't work there. I have a great team that runs operations for me. We are about to launch a new updated website soon (SpartanScreenPrinting.com) as well as another sister company, FighterPrints.com.  Yes I stay in touch with Jon Fitch. He has been a longtime friend of mine. We used to be roommates actually. He was up here with me at AKA Thailand a while back as well.  
I haven't heard much new from Kaensak but we now have Lamsongkram Chuwattana teaching full time with us at AKA Thailand.   Not to keep bringing up my site, but there is a huge archive of video blogs and series we have shot from AKA Thailand on MikeSwick.com. All new and very interesting.   Thanks for following!   
Honestly, I like Dan Hardy and feel no need to beat him up at this point. He is doing his thing and I respect that.   I am still contractually obligated to the UFC if I come out of retirement but it would take a lot to make that happen. I would have to get a fight with McGregor. ;) 
I fish occasionally around Phuket but my biggest catch was a Marlin in Cabo years ago.  
To work hard, never quit and accept your failures. There will be many, but you must pick yourself back up and push harder. I failed at building a gym in Thailand 3 times and lost well into the 6 figures of my life savings before I finally built AKA Thailand. It was so bad that my teammates at AKA HQ were really starting to feel bad for me failing at building a gym in Thailand and everyone was begging me to stop already and come home. I couldn't quit and took the UFC on FOX 4 fight to make the money needed to start AKA Thailand. Lastly, surround yourself with good people. Jim Rohn famously said "You're The Average Of The Five People You Spend The Most Time With". I think that is true and I had to learn the hard way. Be around the people that push you forward and are successful themselves.  
Of course you want to but if you really think about it, everything happens for a reason and the entire cumulation is what makes you what you are today.   As for LPT, surround yourself with success and never give up.

No not really. They talked a lot and many said they would beat me but most of the big talkers lost. I have a good relationship with all of my past opponents now and don't harbor any real hate towards any MMA fighters.  
Don't sweat the small stuff. I overthought too much and added pressure that I shouldn't have. 
Different guy. Mike from Mike's Gym is a Thai guy. This Mike is an American guy living in Thailand. 
To be honest, I haven't been able to keep up. I don't even watch TV that much anymore. Its just work and travel and watching the UFC or studying fight tapes.  
Thanks man I really appreciate you saying that!   The gym is at AKAThailand.com and yes I have tried to fight Matt Hughes ever since he said he was coming out of retirement and he never responded. That is literally the ONLY fight I would come out of retirement to take.  
Thanks! The shop prints T-shirts as well as does Embroidery and Vinyl banners and decals. Obviously fight shorts and banners too.   SpartanScreenprinting.com 
Thanks Brian! It was long hours but good money. I was doing it when the first PT Cruisers came out and they were money makers. 
There are a lot of Thai Fighters learning BJJ and wrestling now in Thailand so there will be eventually. 
Hello, I would like to know who your friend is. I may know him. As far as transitioning in, I think you just have to come and start networking. Its an easy place to come and fit in. Good luck! 
I still need to get a ticket and learn how to space travel first. Hope they have space for me. Its gonna be out of this world though! ;) 
You have to visualize things that you want in life. Actually see them. Print them. Feel them. Want them so much that you will climb out of the slump and chase them.

Thanks McGraner! It was not bad when I won the fights. The second fight in England didn't go so well.  
Train hard and embrace the mistakes and failures. They lead to success.  
Be a student and relax. There are many like you. Then train hard and embrace the mistakes and failures. They lead to success. 
I have a main accountant in America that figures it all out for me and then adds about 250% rate on top and bills me.  
Its a t-shirt and vinyl print shop. SpartanScreenPrinting.com (Soon Will Be Updated) 
I agree with the discipline and respect aspect. I do not think its a good idea for kids to fight at a young age even though it is very common here in Thailand. This is a special circumstance though as it is sometimes the only means for them to escape poverty and create a future for their self and their families.  
First, thanks for the support! In general many fighters in all gyms sustain injuries. Its just part of the game. AKA trains hard and therefore, the penalty is a high injury rate. The upside is a high Champion rate. Luke, DC, Cain, Thomson, Fitch and more... AKA has built more Champions and stars from the ground up than any other gym on this planet IMO. As far as AKA Thailand, shockingly we never miss a fight over injury and I think we train even harder than at AKA HQ.   
Its hard for me to say without all the facts. In general, I think if any fighters have to be drug free, then all fighters should be drug free. Its not like we are playing baseball or basketball. We are are fighting, and the use of performance enhancing drugs can cause serious consequences to the health of the clean and honest fighters. Its also a very bad message for the kids when they see these successful fighters on drugs. I never used anything and did ok for myself. I wasn't a Champion, but I did what I could and did it clean. I think kids need to understand that they also can be successful and even Champions in this sport without taking drugs. 
It totally depends on why you are going, what your wife thinks about it, how old your kids are etc... Its safe but a different lifestyle for sure. Many foreigners do live here with their families though. 
The wait backstage and the walk to the octagon is quite intense for sure. Its a mix of nerves and excitement, and then I transition to a bit of emotional anger right before. I make myself realize that the man standing in the octagon with me is there to take away my dreams and my future and my success. This is unacceptable, and then I fight with everything I have to not let him succeed in his effort. 
Bangkok and Phuket is very safe from Malaria so I never had anything more than just the Hepatitis vaccinations. 
I was never diagnosed with ADD but was diagnosed with Esophageal Spasm, which caused me to lose a lot of weight, drop to welterweight, and eventually start focusing more on a post fighting career. 
There is no real problem actually. Our guests can party and train as much as they want and our fighters are very disciplined and do not cross the line. In order to be a fighter on the team at AKA Thailand, you have to pass a rigorous probation period where everything is evaluated.  
Find a good MMA gym, be a humble student, and train hard! 
I think a warning and then a point deduction next if its clear that the fighter was not trying to avoid doing it. In other words, if a fighter is throwing his open hand out and pokes and eye and gets a warning, then continues to not close his fist and does it again, that should be a point taken away. 
Hello, I am not a fan of this and am glad USADA is coming in now. So long as everyone cannot take steroids, I think that no one should be able to. This is not baseball or basketball. This is a sport where an unfair advantage can have horrible effects on an opponents health.  
Hey bud, yes you can get the visa's required. My gym has a full administration team that helps all of our students and guests get visa's, whether its for a month or a year. Can check out AKAThailand.com or email Info@AKAThailand.com for more info.   My advice would vary depending on what reason you are moving here for, but its a great place that will be an adventure for sure.  
Thanks and I appreciate it!   More weight classes are just going to be a part of the progression of the sport. There are so many fighters now and so many fights. With the current issues of extreme weight cutting, new weight classes will just fix this.   Before, there were far less opponents and less weight classes is how the promotions could make the great fights people wanted to see. Now with so many more athletes, they can make great fights in many weight classes.   Long story short, yes I agree with more weight classes. I think fighters should be able to focus more of the fight and training and less about weight.  
In the very beginning it was a spectacle. Shock value entertainment. Then it became a legitimate sanctioned sports promotion with the ZUFFA acquisition. Now its as mainstream as any sport and growing faster than any other. The up side is how big it is getting and how much some of the fighters are now making. The downside is that there are so many fights that its hard to keep up. Its also hard to make a name for yourself as a fighter now. With over 500 fighters on contract, you really have to be special.  
I tell them that I am sorry, I thought I walked into a Starbucks for a latte.   Seriously though, I don't sleep. I try and take on as much as possible because as most people know, you fail a lot more than you succeed. Its a numbers game and I enjoy the challenge of chasing success. 
We need to stop selling weapons to the Saudis.             And start buying lasers from Lord Buckethead. 
His spending is covered and then some, also investing into institutions now will gain profit in the long run 
I would really love for him to explain how he isn't a communist. Or better yet why he isn't. Because I can see how his views do not constitute communism, but his views are so close in underlying principle that I don't understand why doesn't just fully apply his convictions. Does he see a value to capitalism? Is that morally ok for him? 
Yes, because a politician has never done an ama...  
Good.  Otherwise another generation will be disillusioned later after they have made a mistake, rather than before realising what they are voting for. 
If you're the the dominant party with a majority there is absolutely no reason to call a snap election unless you're extremely confident of being able to increase it in order to not only consolidate your power but postpone the next election which might take place at a time when things are far less favourable for you.   With that in mind, it's pretty incredible that Labour even held on to the seats they had, never mind gaining 30 in what was an attempt by the Conservative party to decimate the opposition while they were in the midst of in-fighting and performing atrociously in polls. 
Nobody wants to use trident you twit! We don't live in the cold war anymore, a nuclear attack isnt likely. Heck, even then it sill wasnt likely... 
The Labour party has record levels of support. Levels not even seen when Tony Blair was elected in 1997. I don't think he's done a terrible job.  Perhaps if Labour had backed him and hadn't been infighting they'd be in downing Street right now. I personally don't want Tory light. I put the blame on Blairites rather than Corbyn.     
Whether you refuse scientific research and established medical conditions or not... The "two genders", male and female constitute as multiple genders, do they not? 
We are doing some lane expansion on I-25 Loveland to FTC we helped secure federal funding for it. But yes, we need to do a LOT more. It also ties into the housing affordability question because people are being forced to live further from where they work- we can't let this hurt our quality of life it definitely has my attention and I will work with local governments and CDOT to preserve what makes CO special. 
At least Colorado is building, unlike other areas. Oppose NIMBYism at all costs. 
I will be a fair referee for all parties, not cozying up or showing partiality to a particular interest over others. 
I will be in Colorado Springs tomorrow as part of my announcement tour. I think that my message of an economy that works for everyone will resonate in every corner of this state. And Republicans have kids and many want them to go to pre-k and kindergarten too! 
I have voted and sponsored legislation on the side of privacy, reigning in the NSA and preventing warrantless wiretaps.  I've always supported a full audit of the fed.  Never met Mr. Snowden.  Focused on running for Governor to roll up my sleaves to make a difference, too much time in DC is spent debating rather than doing. 
yes the state will need to go to the ballot box to see if voter's want to fund our 21st century infrastructure needs.   We are growing and we need to catch up or or quality of life will suffer. Let me know your ideas! 
The veil of public office is easier to pierce than you might think. Depending on where you live, you might have the opportunity to run for city council, school board, state legislature, or other office.   So know your own interests and what you want to do. For me I care a lot about education and ran for and served on the State Board of Education. That is a part-time volunteer job, so I did it for a few days each month was still able to work full time. Congress on the other hand is full time. Our state leg is somewhere in between, they work full time in Denver for 5 months, then part-time the rest and many have other careers to earn income.  So know yourself and what you want to do, get involved with your community (HOA, non-profit boards, other groups), and find a realistic option (not taking on a popular incumbent unless you have a good reason) and go for it! 
I am actually touting Namaste Solar's co-op ownership model statewide, along with other employee ownership models like ESOPS and stock options. How is the co-op ownership working for you as an employee?  In answer to your question, yes of course I support finding a solution to TABOR. Specifically as Governor, I will build a winning coalition (business, educators, Republicans, Democrats) to bring to the ballot a plan to establish full day preschool and kindergarten and invest in our schools. 
I support single-payer health care nationally and if Colorado moves forward it should make sure it is VERY well written and will work. The last thing we want is a failed system that leaves people in the lurch.  I will be putting out more higher education plans over the course of the election about my specific plans to make college more affordable. I also tout dual-enrollment which allows students to get college credit and even an associates degree for free (or close to free) while they are in high school! 
I think we truly are reaching critical mass in tech. We have a vibrant startup community for sure. We have excellent startup infrastructure across our state. We need to be able to keep more success stories here and independently owned, but I think we will get there.  We also need to more fully incorporate our universities like CSU and CU into our tech ecosystem. There are some excellent programs like the Innosphere in Fort Collins, a partnership between CSU and Fort Collins, but we need more collaboration.  Any other ideas? 
well as a "voice of reason" in the house I am but one of 435 and my voice is all too frequently overwhelmed.   But as Governor I can set in place our goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040, universal preschool and kindergarten, and put in place state policies to create an economy that works for everyone by encouraging employee stock ownership 
They are all good and I wouldn't have any problem supporting any in the general. I know Ed Perlmutter and Cary Kennedy best. I've known and worked with Cary for close to 20 years (more so in the early 2000s than recently). I work closely with Ed in Congress. I don't know Michael Johnson or Noel Ginsburg as well personally, I've met them but never worked with them professionally or spent much time with them. I look forward to getting to know them all better over the course of the campaign!  They all seem to be good people and I look forward to hearing more about their ideas! 
health care in Clear Creek? Consider yourselves lucky compared to Summit and Eagle.  We need a Colorado that works for everyone. For our cities, for our suburbs, for our rural areas.   I support  21st century infrastructure including broadband, an education system including apprenticeships and skills, and encouraging employee participation in profits and ownership.  We succeed together as a state and all three parts of my plan are statewide. 
it's an interesting concept and I look forward to learning more about the results of the several pilot projects that are currently in place to try it out 
dude plains and mountain all the way, you get all the defense positions along with unlimited attack capabilities, not to mention a fuck load of trample  
marijuana food freedom (raw milk, hemp, non-USDA beef)  and many other areas relating to expanding personal freedoms  
I have one archived on a flash drive, I'm sad they took it down. I thought it was still up. Boy, Jason and I turned out differently didn't we. But for both of us, this is our last session of Congress. 
Protecting what makes CO special is a top priority for me.  In Congress, I served last session on the Natural Resources Committee where I fought to protect our public lands. Now we face an even greater threat of our public lands being sold off.  I am also working on additional wilderness designations for Summit and Eagle Counties to protect in perpetuity 60,000 additional acres. 
well our main arteries I-25 and I-70 are causing the biggest problems for the highest number of commuters. I would base my priorities on an objective scientific analysis of traffic flow and where the biggest needs are!   I learned a lot as a tech-entrepreneur that helps, mostly to be creative and disruptive and don't accept things the way they are just because they've always been that way 
How else are they going to fund the gluten-free roads? 
if they want to be, sure! and i think they want to be! 
Never banned :)  of course I support the entire LGBT+ community. We've come a long way but we still have a long way to go to achieve equality. 
Random note from an old job of mine - rep Polis has been a significant supporter of Boulder County CareConnect for years; one of their main programs provides transportation for seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
That's why doing these reddit things is great, we don't have time to get to all the questions at physical town halls (especially lately with the increased attendance).  I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but I for one try to make my decisions based on research and evidence and if I was governor I would appoint people to the various state agencies that did the same. I think picking people and setting the tone are two important things a governor can do. Are there any other specific recs you have?  
well one way or the other you will wind up with a different governor in January of 2019 (Hick is term limited). With your help, maybe it'll even be me! 
go for it! Don't let being a member of the LGBT community hold you back! 
'Member South Park? I 'member South Park.  I represent North Park County but sadly not South Park. But as Governor, I'll be the Governor of South Park! I LOVE the show, watched all the recent seasons.  1) Rural broadband 2) better transportation 3) Better access to job skills/training  
My plan is for Colorado to have 100% renewable energy by 2040. Congratulations to Germany on your climate leadership!  Yes many local governments and states in our country will continue to move forwards. 
As governor, I plan to help Colorado maintain a leadership role in the Cannabis industry. We have many opportunities to continue to leverage our "first-mover" advantage into a ecosystem that allows us to continue our industry leadership.  That being said, yes it's possible that sales will decline as CA and other states come fully online. Currently after paying for regulation of marijuana most of the taxes go to school buildings in lower income areas- we need it.  I will do my best to continue CO's leadership role nationally even in the face of additional competition. 
I think fracking should be greater distances from people's homes and more local control 
It's very important for rural communities to have broadband and high-speed fiber. I've been working on this federally and the state can and must step up too. I would like to see high-speed fiber as part of any infrastructure package. Infrastructure ain't just roads and bridges.  SIgn up at polisforcolorado.com so we know who you are and you can get involved :) Say hi when you see me around 
Great question! I am most comfortable on facebook and twitter. And of course I love reddit.  My main challenge with instagram and snapchat is I have trouble making my job visually appealing. Here I am meeting with so-and-so. Here I am meeting with so-and-so. Any ideas about how a candidate can visually engage in those mediums would be greatly appreciated! 
nope Gov can't do that.  I don't make pledges I can't keep ;) 
Happy to help. First of all I know very little about the market you are in (security for consumers). In fact when I first read it I thought you meant that you were selling securities (like stocks) to consumers! Like crowdfunding or something.  That being said, it sounds like you should reach out to the head of Security at major Universities locally (or nationally if your product is national). Get a sense of their needs and let them know what you can do to help them. Within their budget, they usually have quite a bit of autonomy,  You don't need a network so much, even if someone with a big network was doing it they would still need to cold call the heads of security at Universities. Good luck! 
Great question! I have really enjoyed bring by best efforts to modernize Congress. I've hosted hackathons, worked to open Congressional information, and I also still have a year and a half left there so I'm not done yet!  But my reason for being in public service is to make a difference, and I feel I can make a bigger difference by rolling up my sleeves at the state level and helping CO lead the way in renewable energy, an economy that works for everyone, and education. And I can work on modernizing state government with new tech and ideas, and even though it's a smaller pond I'll be able to do more than as 1 of 435 members of Congress! 
what kind of food to you like? price range? food style? 
OMG I AM SO EXCITED!  AND AS GOVERNOR I WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO MORE GAMES THAN AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS! 
I'd love some info and citations on the private military presence in CO if you can post some.  And yes, the threat of biological AND nuclear threats from non-state actors is going up as technology develops. I won't have to worry about that AS much as Governor as a member of Congress, but I will still try to see if there is anything the state can do to keep us safe.    
Wow! That's the first fish I've ever had named after me (that I know if). I hope little Jared lives a long and healthy life.  Your life will be better if CO reaches 100% renewable energy by 2040, our air will be cleaner and we will be healthier and it will create green jobs that can never be outsources  and encouraging more firms to share stock and profits with employees will hopefully affect you to  and if you have kids you will LOVE free preschool and kindergarten, and I say that as a dad of a 5 year old and an almost 3 year old. 
In this area, Governor Hickenlooper has done a good job. We need to make sure that our immigrants feel welcomed and know their rights under the law.  We are a welcoming state, and the Governor needs to set the tone. I wish there was more the Governor could do to fix our broken immigration system but sadly that is up to Congress and I'm not holding my breath for the current Congress to fix it and unite families. 
i plan on serving out my term to fight "this administrations insane policies" and will work to ensure that our Democratic nominee wins and holds this seat 
because many school districts divert funds to early childhood, these funds would be available for other functions if we fund pre-k and K universally! So that's good!  And of course I support more funding for our schools and to make college more affordable but only the voters of the state can provide that, not the Governor :\ 
Dual and concurrent enrollment allow high school students to get college credit, even an Associates degree, for free or close to free while still in high school!  And more state funding for higher ed tied to reductions in tuition would also help. 
Couldn't you blame lobbyists for a large part of that? 
I don't think that there is anyone who thinks that I do the bidding of the oil and gas industry 
I'll give you a curly answer:  If I had absolute power over the legal system I would get rid of the provisions that gave me absolute power. No one should have absolute power, not even a well-intentioned fellow like :)  
I've spent some time with him and like him a lot. You also wouldn't want to mess with him he used to (maybe still?) do one of those pit-fighting things or something like that (more than just boxing, more street fighting or something).  Course whatever we're doing now under Buddy Black is working well!  
Neither one! I support expanding our refugee program AND improving the vetting process   
The question needs to be more specific. I have voted against continuing funding for troops in Afghanistan as an example.  
I'm a parent of a 5 and a almost 3 year old and that is honestly not on my list of concerns. If a parent thinks that the legal treatment of marijuana is causing the disconnect, I suggest they dig a little deeper there is probably an underlying reason for the disconnect not related to the legal treatment of marijuana 
I'm just finishing up an 8 month sabbatical where I didn't do any clinical work, but my general balance is 2 days of clinical work per week, 2 days of research, and 1 weekday with my daughter.  My clinical work is paid, my research work is not. I made the choice to halve my income to pursue this research, definitely not a decision for everyone.  That said, I *could* probably get paid (well) to work in a company doing AI stuff. But I am happy with my balance right now, getting to explore things I think are valuable rather than profitable. 
Sorry, I have seen the paper but it isn't closely related to my work so I can't remember the details. 
So far my own work hasn't shocked me. But the field is moving so fast, there are surprising and groundbreaking results being published almost every day. It is a great time to do research in the field. 
It just kind of happened. I finished my final radiology exams, which are like 18 months of full time study (while working full time, of course), and decided I didn't want to lose my hard won study skills and discipline. I'd always been interested in computer science but had no experience at all. I just decided "what the hey, I'm just gonna do it."  Six months later I had a project i wanted to do, met my team, the rest is history. I ended up doing the PhD pretty much because I was doing this big project anyway (motivated by personal interest and public benefit), and I was advised I may as well get a parchment out of it.  I never expected when I started that I would end up here, but it is an awesome place to be :) 
Only as much as current medical techniques. We have had this debate around genomics for decades, and the outcome world-wide has pretty much been to make it illegal to use genomic information to discriminate against people.  It is definitely an issue worth thinking about. We have a great group of medical ethicists at UoA and we will be working with them in the future. 
Do you mean what languages/libraries etc?  I am a fence-straddling data scientist, because I like both R and python.   I train my neural nets in python, usually with Theano and Keras. But for cleaning non-image data, I love R and the tidy-verse. 
I'd like to see medical images widely utilised for precision medicine. I'd love to see radiomics biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, because I think this could possibly speed up the process by giving an indication of success or failure of treatment earlier. Especially for things like medicines to increase longevity - long follow up times make trials incredibly expensive.  The closer we get to the computer science model of research, the better. Rapid results, rapid iteration, rapid progress. 
"How can I do your job without putting in any of the effort required?"   A radiologist has to go through four years of medical school and at least four years of residency. In the US, that's after completing college.  
Regression and classification are broad categories of machine learning problems. Regression attempts to output continuous numbers (like 0 to 100), classification outputs categories (like yes or no).  Neural networks are capable of both sorts of tasks. In this case we did a classification task (will this patient die within five years), but we can also frame it as regression (how many days etc.). 
The current trend is that life expectancy will rise by between 6 and 9 years in that time period, but I personally think we could do better than that. There is a lot of funding in extending human lifespans right now, with several clinical trials already underway.  One of the long-term goals of this research is to find responsive markers of longevity for use in trials like this, to reduce the amount of follow-up time needed to show efficacy. 
Hi,   I know what you mean. Radiology in particular, at least in my neck of the woods, is ... disinterested... in research. i suspect it is because of the massive increases in workloads over the last several decades, no-one really has time to spend on research.   I just reached out. I got turned away by a few people, it took time, but eventually I found a great match in the team I have now. There were certainly a few lucky coincidences, and I had good support from my early collaborators, but at the end of the day it only happened because I tried. 
nvidia has a huge lead right now, and has essentially captured the whole market. AMD is starting to approach deep learning, but the difference in resources is massive.   They are both GPU companies though. nvidia works with partners and provides tools, but most of the cutting edge work isn't *by* nvidia. They definitely support research very strongly though, almost every paper from research centres has "GPUs donated by nvidia" at the bottom! 
Good question. Mortality is a very strong marker of health, is related to many visual features of disease, and is unambiguous. We chose this as the initial task for those reasons. We will look at disease specific outcomes in future work.  Re: my blog ... the internal linking is because all of the articles are one big piece, with one narrative. Each argument is predicated on previous ones.   That said, there are tons of links to external sources. Looking at the stats, I get about 2-5% of users hitting outgoing links. That sounds pretty reasonable.  Feel free to tell me where you disagree with me though, as I say at the start of each piece I will correct anything that is in error. 
Our system currently manages with all the scanners from one hospital (there are about 4 or 5 CTs that have been used in the dataset), using contrast enhanced studies in any phase. I think it should generalise to a range of environments quite well. 
There are only a few deep learning books around, and I don't have experience with them. The field moves so fast it is hard to justify writing a book.  Obviously, the book "deep learning" is great (Bengio, Goodfellow, Courville), but it is quite advanced.  Honestly I recommend the Stanford course. Even if you prefer books, they have a great set of course notes online. It covers everything you need, in depth. You learn application, theory, fundamentals. It is good.  It does assume basic machine learning knowledge though. 
they wanna play god... instead of focusing on helping patients they plant the seed of fear (the worst enemy for every patient) into their hearts.... been a patient for a long time and I hate this behaviour so much. And yes it is a waste of ressource 
Thanks so much. One tumor was in the middle of the brain but shifted to the right. It wasn't operated on but it's gone! Tumor #2 is on the right side of the brain, about 1-2 inches above the temple but deeper in the brain. Tumor #3 is on the left side and like tumor #2 but on the left. 
I knew I had two tumors in my brain two years before I had surgery, but the doctors hadn't been worried until 2012 when they started to grow. Most of my symptoms were migraines, loss of feeling in my left side of my body, seizures, and mental fogginess. 
The best thing to do is just keep her happy however you can. I see happiness as a medicine. It works for me and I believe it can work for her as well. Be empathetic, but don't treat her any differently. Make her smile and smile with her. 
This battle has been a pure blessing in my life. It's shaped me into the man I am and I'm very grateful for this battle.  Funny thing, in 2012 I was sentenced 2 days before surgery to live then after surgery I was sentenced 2 years. I'm still alive today! What a blessing. I still don't really have a bucket list mentality. Nothing wrong with it, I just sometimes go with the flow. 
Thank you very very much. I'm a musician, so writing music and recording it is my favorite. 
I feel that the body houses the spirit temporarily. I still feel close with my body because I'm living. Even though that I have a lot of faith in God, so I am closer with spirit. 
I did receive remission once but another tumor showed. So we have yet to see where to go. One of my montras is,"Never give up" The fight may be hard, but who said the crown goes to the winner? 
Remission was declared in January of this year, but another tumor was found later on. My doctors have found a new treatment for me to start, but I am postponing the start date by one month to see if the MRI results improve. 
In a way yes but I'm more grateful towards the little things now. 
I did have to stop school but I know that everything is for a reason. Because I know that, I'm never really worried. All this time I've been undertaking this battle has been great and I'm grateful. 
It's writing music and it never changed before and after the journey began. 
Thank you! This is how I've always been. If you get bad news you just have to keep it all moving. I just like to add a smile because it's fun being happy to me! 
Due to the tumor locations and movement, I lost a lot of mobility in my left side. This makes it hard to; walk, eat, brush teeth, get ready for the day, live life, play instruments, etc. etc. So, I'll usually have one to assist me through life. 
The most memorable thing is from the surgery team, when I asked the doctor to take a picture of my tumor. Instead, they filmed the surgery! 
God honestly helps me stay positive. Through this entire journey it was Him that kept me going. In 2012 the moment I learned I was diagnosed with brain cancer, the first thing I did was thank God because I knew this would be for a reason. 
That's awesome! So, don't hate me because I'm a not a full time vegan but I am full time vegetarian.  My favorite meal is actually yellow rice with pineapple, white onions, cilantro, Hawaiian seasoning sauce, topped with avocados that have chili powder sprinkled on top :) 
Just the nausea chemo causes.  A lot of them (I think all) were in total shock. They were also in shock how positive I reacted to the news. 
I do take supplements , while I also follow a routine of simple physical activity that I can handle. I don't have much alternates... 
Wow, what a powerful story about you and your father. I'm glad y'all sound good though. Through my journey, I was inspired to establish a foundation in 2014. Here's the website. Please check it out! www.farwf.org  Thank you so much and I'm happy to send positive vibes your way as well :) 
Well, a lot of people have different characteristics like; tolerance to treatments, age, immune system strength, and most of all POSITIVITY! The tumors did cause me to be physically disabled in the left side but I'm not mentally disabled. 
I usually am pretty careful who I tell that I am gay. For me to be doing this AMA is quite a big step but I'm hoping to make more contacts/friends.  The one incident I had was I was walking with a sighted friend and holding his arm so he could guide me. I had my guide dog with me but I was holding his leash and not his harness. All of a sudden, some kids started yelling "fag, fag, fag" and began throwing bottles at us. My friend said "hey, my friend is blind!" As soon as they heard that, they stopped and apologized and one of them said, "I'm sorry - I thought you were a fag." That was the worst incident that ever happened to me. That was about 10-12 years ago. 
No, I must be honest and tell you I've never had a partner or been in a long-term relationship.  My friend who is doing the AMA is involved in this project and I think it is something that's really needed. In my present situation, I have helpers who would come and help me for a few hours a day, so I have not availed myself of it at this time. If you have more questions about it though, contact my friend u/runbrownmanrun 
(Answering in order)  I realized I was gay when I found that when I hugged a guy or an older male, I had a strong attraction to that person. Whereas when I hugged a woman, I did not feel anything at all. I love women as friends, but hugging them is kind of like hugging an inanimate object for me.  His voice, his smell (a nice cologne) and when I give him a hug. For me, I have to have some kind of a physical contact like a hug before I know if I am attracted to the person. Some people attract me more than others and because I can't see, it must be something to do with pheromones that I can't describe. I have met guys who are wonderful but I don't have an attraction to them and I don't know why.  I love Italian food like lasagna, which is probably why I am such a big guy.  
(Answering in order)  I do not have any racial factors - race is not important to me. I judge people by somewhat intrinsic qualities - kindness, gentleness, people who are not afraid to hug, who are not afraid to touch in a kind way. Those are the things that are important to me.  I have no strong opinion on that except that I have no respect for someone who immediately dislikes someone because of their race  I guess many people have preferences - some like heavy people, some like thin people. For me, I tend to like people who are on the heavy side but that is not always necessary. I tend to like people who are a little hairy, but again that's in no way written in stone. 
I want them to remember me as a person who does his best to help others to understand what it is like to be blind and gay. Also, I hope they will consider me a kind person. I also hope that the fact that I have never seen will make people understand that being gay is not dependent on sight and is not a choice. I know this because I didn't even know the difference between boys and girls when I was growing up. I know that sounds strange, but it is the absolute truth. 
I am interested in meeting gay people in general, not just gay people who are blind. I am not really the kind of person who is good at starting groups. There have been some groups for disabled gay people but I don't think there are any right now that would be good for me. 
Wow, I've heard the Finns are very lovely people but I've never met one till now!  I think one of the things that keeps me going is I hope that, if I put myself out there, like I'm doing with the help of u/runbrownmanrun, people will respond and I will make some interesting and meaningful contacts.  
I have a computer with speech and, as I type on the keyboard, it speaks what I have written. I was friendly with the person who edited Bent Voices (the website where the essay was posted) and he posted it for me.  I can't but I am. How can you prove your sexuality? 
this is a request only, not actually lord buckethead himself 
It's the kind of thing he'd probably do once he'd had enough sleep.  
JB: Any and all of the Flower Scouts. I love the Flower Scouts.  AL: Mine's Preston. He's the best.  BM: Mine's Quartermaster (JC: You have a thing for old men.) 
GH: Depends. These days the tendency is to bounce ideas around the animation creative staff. The more people we have chipping in ideas the stronger it gets.  MT: Collaboration! High five!  JC: One of the biggest advantages Camp Camp had was its longer (for us) development cycle. We were able to really flesh out the setting and how the camp worked, and what a typical episode would be.  GH: Plus Matt and Burnie are always pushing us to make the best content we can.  
AL: It comes down to the director and animator, and usually we get to do our own key poses after getting direction from Jordan. We add our own little touches to it as long as it fits the character/scene. He's very open to collaboration.  JB: We can often hear laughter coming from the writer's room so we trust that it's gonna be good. 
JC: In the episode that just came out today, we have a 360-degree rotating shot of a two-dimensional character that I knew was probably going to kill Yssa, our lead animator. Before we even did storyboards for it I asked her to make sure she could do it, and rose to the occasion and absolutely crushed it. 
JC: Storyboarding the shots for the scene in the finale between Max and David was a lot of fun to direct. Coming up with more dramatic angles to adjust the tone for the scene was cool. Going from David on edge and Max in control, then switching, then having them be on equal footing without ever really moving from their spots was an interesting challenge.  BM: Mine was Spooky Island!! I had to animate the scene just before the reveal at the end.  I loved playing with all the emotions happening in that scene from terrified Neil and Jasper to angry Max. 
JB: It's not really a project, but a part of Camp Camp... that GOD DAMN flag in the intro crashed so many times when I was animating it.  AL: The cloud Campbell from Episode 12 was traditionally animated and had to be done during the last day of production. Maggie is the worst. Just kidding. (Not really) (Justkidding..dakjfoia) 
JC: My favorite to write for is Nurf; we always say lines in his voice in order to make sure it feels like something he'd say. Also his voice is just really fun to imitate.  BM: Old Man in Rocking Chair #1 from episode 8. There's just something about him.  MT: Larry the Hamster! I miss him so.  
MT: ~*~Boring answer time~*~ This is always one of the most difficult questions to answer. We don't typically work on episodes linearly, so if we're just looking at actual days it would probably be about 6 weeks. But if you broke out every step of the pipeline and completed them one at a time, we'd be looking at about 14 weeks per episode. *pants*  (I can provide spreadsheets later.)  JC: Spreadsheets are lame. 
MT: We were really surprised at how many fans applied to join the team. (Andrew is the biggest RT fan I've ever met. [BM: Actually Tanya is.]) If we see someone who is talented when going through resume submissions we hire them?  Also I'm really proud of saying "post-abortion rape" on On the Spot   JC: I can't top that.   
JC: I actually never went to a camp, but a lot of the inspiration I use for writing episodes is just from summer vacations when I was a kid. I take a lot of inspiration from Ed, Edd, n Eddy especially. Miles was an eagle scout so I guess he knows all the camp shit.  AL: I went to a summer camp but there weren't like any Nazis or anything!  MT: I went to Engineering Camp! *pushes up glasses* 
GH: With Max you're always trying to strike a balance between savvy-kid and some kind of childlike ignorance.   JC: Keeping Campbell's weird type of humor in check so that not every joke is about a Cayman Islands bank account or some geopolitical statement can be challenging as well. 
JC: It used to be a mix of Flash and After Effects for season 1 of X-Ray and Vav. Then we discovered the glory of Toon Boom and never looked back. Even RTAA is made in Toon Boom now. 
JC: Homestar Runner is the only reason I became an animator.  JB: The pencil test for the Avatar: The Last Airbender finale fight. I changed my major after seeing that.  BM: There wasn't really any one time I got inspired, but I was always genuinely interested in animated films when I was younger. And I always would watch the behind the scenes stuff. Then I discovered Glen Keane's interviews and his animation process and I knew then that's what I wanted to do.  AL: I saw Tom & Jerry as a kid and didn't understand how it was made. Then I realized you could have a job making things like that, and it sounded a lot cooler than an office job!  
MT: That's the only way this show gets made. The 2D team is surprisingly small but mighty so many people wear multiple hats.  BM: The character designers will sometimes talk to us about how we rig and animate the characters so they can implement that into their designs. (Animators have also been rigging and modeling the characters thus far.  We wear many hats!)   
JB: I like the reprise of the Camp Camp theme at the end of season 1  MT and AL: Quartermaster's wobbly dildo hand.  GH: Every time we make Miles scream as David.  BM: I like the part where Max fixes the Order of the Sparrow staff. It's cute. :3  JC: When David and Max stare each other down in the finale, and the lightning strikes in the background. 
JC: We've done a couple of things animation-wise nobody has picked up on. In the Spooky Island episode, we didn't give Jasper a shadow. And in Sex Swing episode 1, the dialogue on the TV in the last scene is actually dialogue from a scene in the finale episode.  Also our storyboard artist, Al, puts a crap-ton of stuff in the backgrounds of a lot of shots. 
JB: More than you'd think, but less than they deserve.  GH: One mmmmilllionnn dollars. 
AL: Danny Devito  MT: David Cross  GH: Donald Glover  JB: Justin Roiland  JC: Matt Chapman or Alex Hirsch 
MT: We've been working with a lot of people on projects throughout the company this year, including animating the trailer for the new game we're publishing Battlesloths (check it out if you haven't already!) But don't be surprised if you see more 2D animation popping around here and there.  GH: Facilities and accounting seem cool - let's do something with them. 
JB: Last season's finale was pretty crazy, with the rain. Turns our animating rain is hard.  BM: I had to animate Neil rotating on the operating table in episode 7, and slowly turn his head. It required a lot of traditional animation with lots of hand drawn stuff.   GH: Non-typical movements tend to be the most challenging things to animate.  AL: THAT FUCKING CLOUDY CAMPBELL IN  EPISODE 12 
JC: The reason Nurf wasn't around early on in season 1 was because we had no idea what his character would be. We finally had a breakthrough with the "bully with a conscience" angle and he's been stealing scenes ever since. 
MT: We are who we are, we don't change for no one!  JB: I don't think we were very reserved at all last season  AL: What JB said - if anything we can get away with more now  GH: I don't know what you all are talking about - get ready for the most WHOLESOME CAMP CAMP YOU CAN IMAGINE - breathe a sigh of relief, no more cursing  BM: We're all so much better at using the tools that I think we're all more confident in our abilities 
JB: Band Camp Kid  JC: Anime Kid  MT: Rasta Kid  GH: Pasta Kid  AL: I'm already a camper so the best one already exists.  (If you didn't notice already, there is a camper from when Davey went to Camp Campbell that looks just like Andrew - because it is Andrew. Where the fuck is my camper?! - mt) 
JB: How the two counselors from when Davey went to camp look like Gwen's parents.  JC: Canonically they ARE NOT Gwen's parents. But y'know if you want to have that as your head cannon, I'm not going to stop you.  MT: Terrace House -  we are addicted (Mizuki is best girl)  GH: Maggie's addiction to reality shows  AL: Maggie's addiction to Steve Buscemi  GH: Our addiction to Maggie's addictions 
MT: Reptar!  AL: The Dirty Bubble  JC: Max  JB: Rogue bears, I dunno.  BM: Manbearpig  GH: Kerry 
JC: We try to limit ourselves to one musical number per season (they're really difficult to make x_x)  MT: One thing to look forward to musically is new songs from Richie Branson in the end credits for every episode! SO STICK AROUND CHUMPS! 
MT: I feel like it's made the department grow a lot closer. But it does make maintaining the inter-departmental relationships more difficult. Plus I hate having to go to the other building all the time for meetings.  AL: We still have our own mini-fridge, so that's a plus. 
All: We appreciate your point of view and definitely try to take these thoughts into consideration whenever we approach any piece of content. We'd rather acknowledge the darker parts of the world than ignore them and let them fester. We don't think that any jokes are presented in a way that condones any type of hate. We're not trying to normalize the outrageous but sometimes we'll use the outrageous to demonstrate how ridiculous a character's thinking or motivations are. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to address concerns such as these. 
Great minds think alike! We just answered the first part of this question from another user (pittgrad09).   This project is the same in the sense that we must complete all of the WHO requirements needed to declare elimination of transmission in Nigeria just as we completed them in these other places. It's different because Nigeria is so much larger (most affected country in the world).  We think that five of the 37 states have done this already in Nigeria and many others are close. The population spared of river blindness in those five states alone dwarfs everything that I mentioned above in the Americas, Uganda, and Sudan. (F. Richards)  
 $100 million will be used to super-size the program and enhance the flexibility to respond to the local epidemiology of the disease. For example, those areas we think are ready to stop mass treatment with Ivermectin will need a full WHO type evaluation that requires molecular laboratory support. That will be costly. In those areas where transmission is ongoing, we will need to add additional interventions like twice per year treatment with Ivermectin. That will be expensive too. Lastly, there are many areas in Nigeria that we have to reassess to determine if they are ready to stop or if they need twice per year treatment. That will be costly. The point is that we urgently need to do all of these things as soon as possible.   It can't be business as usual!!! (The Carter Center, Frank Richards) 
1) Nigeria is the country most affected by river blindness in the world. 40% of the global population at risk is in Nigeria.   2) No, not for this proposal opportunity.  3) 12.5% because there are eight semi-finalists.   (Frank Richards) 
It would be impossibly expensive and well over $100 million to pay distributors to treat over 50 million people. Just think, this is two dollars per person to treat over a period of up to five years. That's less than 50 cents per person per year.   So, we have to rely on volunteerism and it has worked up until now. Remember, Nigeria already has the largest Ivermectin distribution program in the world based on volunteer delivery.  In a way, we should also look at this as community empowerment and how people themselves can change their OWN lives. (Frank Richards)  
Good question. The big issue is in areas where transmission is ongoing. We absolutely have to treat twice per year there, with good treatment coverage as soon as possible if we are to stop mass treatment throughout Nigeria by the year 2022. (Frank Richards). 
It is important to recognize that The Carter Center is making this application on behalf of the Nigerian partnership dedicated to eliminating river blindness from the country. That includes the Ministry of Health, a number of other NGOs, and the communities afflicted by river blindness. We will implement the program through providing sub-grants to our partners who have been working in different states in the country to fight river blindness for many years. We all believe we can do this!!!! (Frank Richards) 
Great question!  Probably, and if not, $100 million is still very close to what we need.   A big issue is what the value of the Nigerian currency (Naira) is against the U.S. dollar. In other words, $100 million can be worth a lot more or a lot less depending on global exchange rates.  And recently the Naira has been falling against the U.S. dollar. If it is not enough, The Carter Center has always had strong partnerships and generous donors. The infusion of these funds will surely draw other donors to the cause! (Frank Richards). 
We admire all of the semifinalists and believe all proposals are worthy to be funded. If only there were enough money to do massive good!  That said, our proposal will eliminate a disease once and for all that will benefit generation after generation of Nigerians and serve as a beacon for other countries to follow suit. We believe in a world free of river blindness. (F. Richards) 
The Carter Center has worked in the Americas as a partner to eliminate river blindness from four countries using Ivermectin: Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and last and most recently, Guatemala.  We've also had great success in Africa in Sudan and Uganda. Although those countries have not completed elimination within their borders like those countries mentioned above. (Frank Richards) 
Insecurity like Boko Haram, and/or kidnapping and other insecurity is a big risk for everyone involved in this - Nigerians and foreigners. This keeps me up at night. But the people working on this are heroes! They are willing to take the risks and be on the front lines to treat the most neglected people in the hopes in solving at least one of their many problems.   (F. Richards). 
Thank you so much! We are a big fan of our fans!   I've been in love with parasitic diseases since I was a medical student at Cornell. You can read my profile on cartercenter.org. The Atlanta Journal Constitution did a whole story on me to answer all of your questions and this is on our website also. (F. Richards) 
The Nigeria Onchocerciasis Elimination Committee (NOEC) has developed standard operating procedures for assessing these areas. In a nutshell, we go to villages located close to rivers where there are rapids and test children for antibodies that show they have been exposed or infected to river blindness. The test is a blood test (finger stick) for OV16 antibodies.  If greater than one percent of kids are infected, the area is considered to be at risk.  (F. Richards) 
Thanks MagnumPeeEye! Great name. A control program is one that goes on forever, whereas a true elimination program is one that comes to a safe ending. Elimination programs are much more difficult than control programs because they have to reach everyone, they have strict guidelines (high burden of proof), and an accelerated window to success. That means they are more costly, but in the long run they are infinitely more cost-effective. One more thing - not every disease can be eliminated. There is no dishonor in a good control program, but at The Carter Center we believe that when a disease CAN be eliminated, we should go for it! Because the rich and the poor all benefit equally form an elimination program, we believe there is an ethical imperative. This fits completely with President Carter's belief system of equity.  (F. Richards).  
Actually quite many of them, I'll write which I can remember for now:  1. Clean Code By R.C. Martin (Still reading) 2. Refactoring by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler 3. Introduction to Algorithms 4. Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides 5. The Good Parts Of Javascript 6. How to build API's that you won't hate 7. Python Algorithmic Thinking 8. The Elements Of Statistical Learning (Still reading) 9. SQL Queries For Mere Mortals  10. PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice 11. Modern PHP 12. Head First Design Patterns 13. Javascript Ninja 14. Domain Driven Development (Planning to read) 15. Laravel Documentation (Dunno, but it's just so elegant!) 16. Probabilistic Overview (Can't understand, still trying!) 
I am sorry but good with hardware in the sense, It can run in any machine (PC, linux based system), speaker (inbuilt, bluetooth, headset), same with mic and so on.  The initially goal was exactly that but due to lack of certain packages I resisted doing that, but yes in the future I could really see that happening, the thing is Python code doesn't work with mobiles yes you can use some kind of compiler but all of these modules weren't available, so I need to write all of the standard development kits and then integrate with python compiler to Java for android.  So one other choice could be to build the entire Stephanie on Java itself which I might do it if I clear up some time in my busy schedule, but you're more than welcome to read and copy any kind of logic from Stephanie to create your application!  
No ofcourse not, *cough* Stephanie is an open-source assasgoodin platform built specifically for voice-controlled applications as well as to automate daily tasks and hence imitating much of an virtual/personal assistant's job. It is written in python and I call it more as a framework than an application. 
Thank you! You need to have a solid understanding of fundamentals and few design patterns after that you can easily look up the documentation of various packages and integrate them as needed.  But yes more often that not you need to create your own package because of it's unavailability, and the architecture of the application is really important if you wanna create something stable and efficient!   That's why design patterns are amazing to get hold off, after that you need some imagination and some creativity? Sounder Algorithm for instance, I had to research about NLP in order to come up with an idea, some solid principles of mathematics doesn't hurt either! 
Probably finish reading all of the books which aren't completed, next step would probably be two mini personal projects and another stock market manipulation.  I am honestly looking for a job, I live in a small town in India, so I'll be trying to move out to big city and learn some new experience from it, but as of now, I am constantly reading books and completing courses, i dunno I just love learning as compared to working.  You didn't? Check the developer API! I have demonstrated some demos to write as well!  As I said before, I believe systematic education hampers my speed, I am one of those individuals who can keep learning/working for 16hours straight and then go a week without doing anything real good. And alongside I believe in 21st century, with all of the resources present in front of you, there is no real need of a college unless you lack in social skills. 
Just three things:  1. A working machine: windows, linux or whatever. 2. Speaker: Inbuilt, headphones, bluetooth, headset? 3. Mic: inbuilt, bluetooth, headset, headphone, freaking phone connected to machine? 4. Internet Connection.  And you're done, download the files, install it and it's ready to work, check more in the installation guide where there's step by step procedure written!  
I dunno honestly, I always loved the open source community, and wanted to contribute to it! Plus I am kind of fun dude, like I invent stuffs for fun, because I wanna use them, its only after that I realize, hmm, maybe others can use it too? But other than that I just wanted a free virtual assistant without any kind of ad blot.   I am 18 years old currently, 5 months to get 19! 
Honestly, I don't have a programming job yet, I have answered it above in more detail.  I'd say, learn more about design patterns and actually create/collaborate with other programmers to make some personal projects which then you can share it with the community to get some feedback and take it from there! 
I am a high school graduate, I graduated last year, Honestly Google.  I'd say start with some basic course, that isn't too long, once you complete that you start to get an inner belief it can kickstart things, atleast thats what happened to me. 
Sure why not? It'll be really good! I believe for scripting Python is among the best programming language to work with!  I started with Java honestly, not exactly But I knew data structures, oop principles and what not, but it was python which helped me immensely to become better with it's design patters, and coding regulations.  You know what if you really like the 'feel' of an interface, give codecademy.org a shot, it's a really good platform to learn programming interactively! 
Yes, that is pretty much unavoidable! People always ask the wrong questions.  
That Steven Spielberg accidentally stole the title of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" from Dr. Hynek 
That Dr. Hynek was a badass astronomer who pioneered the field of celestial imaging. The Hubble space telescope is Hynek's progeny! 
I believe we were switched in the hospital. Thank you for noticing! 
The Tremonton, Utah movie film from the late 1950s is pretty convincing evidence that something real was seen.  Catcher's mask, hands down 
That many UFOs seem to be both physical and non-physical at the same time 
Definitely along the lines of another dimension or another vibration, if you prefer... Something that our science may never be able to xplain! 
I have become less enamoured of the "extraterrestrial hypothesis" because there is so little evidence to back it up 
Start with "The Edge of Reality" by Hynek and Jacques Vallee, then follow up with Carl Jung's UFO book. 
The question assumes that any of the Tracy's would be helpful, which is open to debate. But if they were useful, John Tracy would be the most useful, as he manned Thunderbird 5, the space station in earth orbit.  
This will sound weird, but the Japanese film "Goke, Bodysnatcher from Hell" is the best alien movie ever! 
The only UFOs I've seen I'm pretty sure were lame Chinese lanterns :( I Know plenty of people who have really strange, scary UFO experiences, and I kind of envy them 
Great question! He did battle with a number of interesting foes, and I had to focus on only one: Carl Sagan. I wish I could have included more of those villains and how Hynek dealt with them. 
Really, my experiences only expand my opinions of what is possible, and so I think of death as an interesting adventure 
Well, that's a trick question you see... I'm not sure if "scientific" work applies to UFO research anymore! 
Didn't we already send Matt Damon? Seriously check out the work of Robert Zubrin. He's got it all figured out! 
Stop going to UFO conferences and events that feature the same tired old UFO "experts" talking about the same tired old topics. Avoid anyone who claims to have a "smoking gun."    
That is an excellent question! A number of respectable UFOlogists have put considerable time into studying this very thing, and while there are unquestionably geographical trends that appear from time to time, they never seem to amount to anything. There's a great story about the government apparently having such data and using it to predict a sensational UFO event in the 1950s, but I have found no way to prove or disprove the story. 
I love Men In Black stories! Not the Will & Tommy Lee kind of MIB, but  the creepy, terrifying, strangely inhuman kind that harass and threaten UFO witnesses. The best account of those I've seen is John Keel's awesome book The Mothman Prophecies.  I can't speak for Dr. Hynek, but the most hair-raising thing I've come across as a UFO investigator was a local family with a history of paranormal experiences and a very real, inexplicable link to one of the famous "saucer crash" myths that was very likely an Army psyops scam. That one still gives me goosebumps! 
My brother Matt & best sister-in-law Casey got for that for me for my birthday a while back. It is a "Zanti Misfit" from The Outer Limits, and it's scary as hell! 
Yes, I worked as an investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) from 2011 to just recently. I've investigated about 150 sightings, and of those about 25 were just too weird and perplexing to be explained. At least by me.   
That's an interesting thought. I could almost see it, but that would mean that our future selves are jerks for messing with us like this, wouldn't it? 
My favorite genre is science fiction, but my favorite film is not sci-fi at all: it's a 1982 British comedy called "Local Hero." 
Some of them likely are, but beware of making blanket analyses... That's what gets most UFOlogists into trouble. 
I have no idea who "Sheriff Mason McKinley" is. Can you elaborate? 
The biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization is that there is not enough research to use it on patients.   The biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization is that it has therapeutic benefits far greater than research would suggest.  
It's a mix between cancer, autism, seizures, PTSD. This is only for pediatric patients, however. There is no way to approve adults for marijuana yet but access should be available by Spring of next year, which is fast, imo.  
I believe that people do get slightly stupider when they are high. I don't think it's very significant though and most of it centers around the short-term memory loss.  In the long run, I think it may be beneficial for intelligence. It certainly won't increase it, but I think there is a protective effect on brain cells and the mind and I certainly don't believe any decrease in intelligence occurs from long-term use. Cigarettes and alcohol on the other hand...  
Cannabis in general will be useful because of its anti-inflammatory properties and improved tolerance to chronic pain.  
Talk to your own doctor first, if you feel comfortable with that. Then, if they are not applying to be a registered cannabis physician in PA, call our office (855-420DOCS, or 844-4PA-WEED) sometime in the fall when we're closer to the medication being available and we will touch base with you then about the most recent regulations and policies concerning attaining a medical marijuana card.  
It'll be a long time until it's legalized on a federal level. The current administration is not accepting of it's medicinal status as is.  
The hardest challenge has been fighting the criticism and false allegations encountered by individuals, groups and entire organizations.   Here's the catch: Those people who have hurt me the most and caused me the most distress have been pro-marijuana activists. No person or group that is against marijuana has caused me even close to the amount of damages as those with personal interests in the marijuana industry.  
I'm not OP, but am a Neurologist/Pain Specialist, with a subspecialty in Epilepsy, am also an MMJ Prescriber in NY. Can see some of my posts in regards to proof, and all that good stuff.   To answer your question, yes Medical Marijuana could help you combat this panic if you were utilizing CBD-oils in appropriate dosages.  
Some of the most interesting ones to me include the Crohn's disease study from journal of gastroenterology I believe from a few years ago. The more recent larger epidemiological study(s) from earlier this year that verify what I see in my own patients at the clinic. The Harvard studies with tumor suppression on breast cancer tumors in vitro. The CBD study in NEJM from this past month by Devinsky, et al. showing CBD benefits on seizures in kids with the Dravet syndrome. The large California-based epidemiological studies from 5-10 years ago that demonstrated safety and limited long-term side-effects. These are some of the good ones out of the limited research we have.   What's far more interesting to me though is seeing the results on my own with my own eyes. It is eye-opening, to say the least.  
I'm not so sure it would be very beneficial to you without the feeling of being high. From my experience treating patients with similar symptoms, it's the psychoactive constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that has the most therapeutic effect. Therefore, I think you should reconsider the possibility that getting high may actually be beneficial to your psyche. Take this all with a grain of salt cause without a proper doctors visit with me such recommendations are generalized and may not be true to you or another reader since it is so individualized, this treatment. 
DE is a microcosm of what shouldn't happen. Essentially, it has become a medically legalized state with one company holding a monopoly, completely unable to keep up with the demand, resulting in a large blackmarket for patients holding medical marijuana cards. The goverment-run medical marijuana program is really great though.   PA is a completely different ballpark. It has banned flower and the smoking of cannabis. I believe this regulation will be a blessing in disguise if it does persist after the state fully adopts the medical marijuana industry. One thing is for sure: The state is rolling out its program smoothly and quickly relative to other states.  
There isn't much data to suggest smoking cannabis is unhealthy. Certainly not like cigarettes. Still, there are a lot of carcinogens and tar inhaled in the smoke. So even though there isn't much data to suggest it's bad for you, we can extrapolate that by removing those harmful byproducts of combustion, we are getting the same benefits without the additional contaminants, thus creating a greater net positive for one's health than smoking marijuana.   
I don't think that this is going to be helpful. I've never read anything on this and can't even think of a mechanism by which that could happen. That's my initial impression.  
Recreational is one thing.  It's not the worst thing you can do in terms of recreational drug use but altering mood and cognition may not be the best either.  If your brain is under 24 years of age I would lean in the "not good idea" direction more, knowing what we do about brain development.   Replacing or forsaking actual treatments is another. Please don't do that.  /Not op, but a psychiatrist. 
I definitely believe that marijuana should remain medical. I also believe it should not require a doctor to get and should be available to anyone in need of it. I call that "Over the Counter Medical Marijuana."   There have been no significant problems with recreational legalization in many individual states now so I think we can say that the same would hold true if the remaining states legalized. The pros and cons are really the same regardless of who I am "being." Personally, I usually remain in the same (mind)frame regardless of circumstances so that question doesn't apply to me much.  
I guess medical marijuana prohibition tends to be associated with more conservative viewpoints.  
It's basically a pseudo-recreational situation. If they would just eliminate the need for a doctor but keep it medical patients could continue to receive the same benefits without needing a shill physician's assessment. "Over the counter medical marijuana." It's the best of both worlds.   
I find that psychologists and mental therapists are much more open to the use of medical cannabis to treat mental illness than psychiatrists are! I've had a very positive response from psychologists and behavioral counselors throughout PA and DE who have asked me to come speak to them and teach them about cannabis therapy. Psychiatrists on the other hand... well, I had to import my own into DE from PA because not a single psychiatrist in Delaware would help a patient get a medical marijuana card. In a sense, there still doesn't exist a psychiatrist from Delaware that approves patients for medical marijuana. The reasons for that are very complicated and probably too subjective for me to discuss like this on the record. :) 
I have not had any patients tell me that their visual 'floaters' improved after starting medical cannabis. Can't say any have had that be a primary problem either.   Tinnitis, on the other hand, has on multiple occasions walked through my door. Patients with cranial trauma-induced ringing in the ears have contacted me specifically because cannabis use eliminated their tinnitis (each case was a unilateral problem, fyi) immediately and completely. While this is only a few patients personal accounts, the similarity of their experiences suggests to me there may be a real therapeutic benefit that they are experiencing. Time will tell! 
I think that there are too many politics involved in the politics of federal marijuana legislature, if you know what I'm saying. I don't think I have enough influence to create change on that level. I have, however, changed state laws abour marijuana. Last year I helped approve terminal illness as a condition in Delaware by contributing to the petition that was submitted and writing a letter of support. I have been in talks with the PA MMJ program too and expect to be in close communication with them in the future, the same way I am in Delaware with the DE MMJ program, though right now they are completely too consumed by the task of instituting the state's new marijuana policies and birthing a whole industry from scratch. 
Getting high is separate and not necessary for the herbs therapeutic benefits.  
No, it isn't a permanent solution. Medical Marijuana is similar to that of many medications, you would need to maintain proper dosing in order to adequately address any symptom.  
Yes, THC has been shown to cause anxiety and paranoia in users.  
It's part of the process, as a prescriber myself I've had patients come seeking MMJ but having no documented diagnosis and/or ailments. It's not awkward, it's just being honest.  
As generalised as it may sound, yeh, I think theres some credence in doing something like that - i know efforts are ongoing to tap into that superstition element and make out that rhino horn curses you or something like that. ALthough I like the specifics of your idea!!!!  I do agree its something that should be addressed with some vigour. 
Hardest was simply managing different identities, and constantly pretensing to be someone else. It was a bit draining!  Never found out, but close to it on occasion - if baddies were even a mite suspicious, they would often address you as 'officer' or something, just to see how you would react, and you are alwats somewhat paranoid so you begin to think 'Oh no, do they know?'  
No questions are stupid! The difference is chalk and cheese. INTERPOL are not cops. Its simply an organisation which tries to facilitate cooperation between countries. INTERPOL staff have no powers, no investgative capabilities and no jurisdiction (unless they are seconded police officers working WITHIN theor own jurisdictions). It's a rather lumbering bureaucratic organisation, which does the best job it can given its limited remit.  Compared to being an undercover cop, it was much less exciting, but much more interesting if that makes sense? 
Maybe, but then are we not encouraging the concept that ivory as decoration or status symbol is acceptable, and perpetuating this ideal? 
A bit of both, but majority of work is targeting those involved at the middle/upper end of the chain certainly from an investgation perspective 
SOmetimes the most innocuous situations were scariest - just being in the company of very bad people, not knowing what their intentions were or anything like that. Got stuck in a dead end road once, with a guy with a gun, and couldnt see my backup. SPhincter was clenching somewhat. There were a few scary moments, but honestly, nothing which would make your hair stand on end! Thats the reality Im afraid!! 
In some prvate game reserves, ostensibly, yes  - I don't work in that sphere, but some reserves would consider 'conservation' to mean heavily armed paramilitary guards with shoot to kill policies. There are certainly reserves (especially in southern Africa) where trophy hunting fees will fund actual conservation, but I retain a healthy level of sceptisiscm about that sort of thing. 
Theresa May. Not my fave person anyway. Its pretty damning really - we need to be at the forefront of emilinating the trade, which includes delaing with 'laundered' ivory which surfaces in Europe. It's not (as some in the chattering classes may think) about ivory per se, it's ultimately about the destruction of a rather magnificent species of animal, and I think its incumbent upon governments to do their bit, and attack the issue from all angles. 
- Yes - My wishes would be better choice of tattoos, a permenant supply of strong Ethiopian coffee, and an end to children needlessly dying globally - I'd be happy, but somewhat slighted, possibly slightly violated/used 
I can help your friend if you give me his name and his current location. And his phone number.  On a serious note, no-one is ever 'wanted by INTERPOL'   INTERPOL sometimes publishes Red Notices to alert other national police agencies that someone is wanted by another country, so, if its true, your friend will be wanted by the state where he is alleged to have committed an offence, not by INTERPOL. INTERPOL have no powers of arrest or anything.  The situation in Venzuela is very grave, and hopefully some semblance of order will reign soon. 
Really????? INTERPOL is an international organisation comprising almost every country in the world, regardless of our membersjip of the EU. The question should be 'Do we get any benefit from INTERPOL?'!!! It is a much misunderstood organisation! 
Yes often. In which case I am adept at using the inside of the toilet roll (the cardboard bit) to remove most of the detritus. After that, well, it gets a bit difficult. 
I like to think of myself as a living Pez Dispenser version of Beeker from the Muppets 
Each day is pretty unique, depending on the days news, if I'm out filming or down in an edit putting a piece together. It's a very communal office, so if you're not on the show you can hop into joke meetings or help out some other aspect of the show. Normally if I'm not on I'm probably prepping for an upcoming field shoot or perusing the internet for some nugget of news to jump into. Either way, there is still a part of me thinking about what I will be watching on Netflix later in the night- but ultimately I'll spend an hour scrolling through Netflix, unable to make a decision and thus leaving me frustrated by my indecisiveness. Then it's the morning and I do it again.  
I grew up in Michigan where guns were much more normalized. It's always been an interesting issue in America as they mean very different things to people depending on how and where you grew up. Also, Ive done a few pieces on TDS about guns and found the conversations on both sides of the topic to be fascinating. Surprisingly  there seemed to be a good amount of common ground that wasn't being talked about and I wanted to go back to Michigan and hear some of the moderate voices than don't tend to get air play. 
1. We were filming with Pat McNamara at a North Carolina gun range on the back of his flat bed truck. It started rolling down the hill and while the crew stood dumbstruck, Pat Mac took off, full sprint and grabbed the truck, put it in park and also saved equipment that was near destruction. He is a super hero  2. GIANT step forward 
The Good Guy with a Gun Piece was a favorite. Going through the process of training to be a "good guy" was eye opening. Those dudes who run the response training were really impressive. Outside of guns I enjoyed sitting down and talking with Pastor Mark Burns, and had me a blast doing the "Future Christ" segment. I picked three. I'm sorry, perhaps that's my vanity breaking through. 
Because then he would be forced to show reasonable gun advocates instead of crazy people like militias. 
Thanks! I gotta say Alaska. Denali national park. Not only is it gorgeous and unique, but the people of Alaska have their own pace and way of looking at the world that was refreshing.  
It's not the ONLY way, but it is one of the most effective ones. 
This is a great question. I can't claim to have the answer but I do think it's important to study the links guns have to violence. It's too easy to automatically equate guns with violence, but at the same time, it's too easily dismissive to separate the gun as a tool from the violence that may result from it. Either way, all of us can agree that we should be exploring how to lower violence in general. At its most basic level, I think funding to study the link is a good first step to see  what the next productive step could be. 
Without knowing anything about it, just want to point out that a "balanced" special (on any topic) would examine arguments from both sides and challenge people on both sides. So in this case, challenging a gun owner in one part of the special doesn't mean the whole thing is anti-gun. 
I joined the college radio and really got into DJing! I met all my close friends at the station and they definitely showed me the music I am into now. Producing came naturally once I was DJing for about 1-2 years.   I started DJing with Traktor in the beginning! And I've always been producing with Ableton. 
Thank you!!! Most of my clothes are actually from Korea. There are a lot of young and independent designers there who try out crazy ideas in small runs because it's possible to do that there. I'd say my favorite looks from those designers are generally dusty/faded color palettes and loose/comfy fits! 
I think you doing you is most valuable! It is fun to try different style and imitate producers you respect. But at the end of the day it's most unique and even enjoyable for yourself if you do whatever you think sounds cool and right 
Haha I am amazed you remember this!! So that "coming soon" was actually referring to a photoshoot I did with my friend Jake. Those photos have been used repeatedly since then, but not the car one - you're right! Maybe it's time to bring it back...  
Hmm I think it's never something I consciously think about. But I think subconsciously it might have something to do with my music. It definitely helps me to separate the two!   And thank you : ) 
Do you mean in regards to production? Or in general? If you mean the ladder, I have no idea lol With music, I've really enjoyed all the different types of collaborations that have happened since I started! 
They're really great! I really like the people that work there and what they're doing for this community : ) Thank you x 
It really varies. It could take as short as 3-4 hours or as long as a month/year depending!   My process also changes, but typically it starts from a bunch of sketches I make on my phone (voice recordings, loops, etc) to then importing it to Ableton and adding on/developing the pieces with instruments and more vocals. 
Hi! Thank you so much! My process always changes, but generally speaking I collect a bunch of sketches during my commutes (voice notes, loops on apps on my phone, etc) and pick and choose later at home or in my studio and develop it from there!  And ducks.. I'm not mad at ducks : ) 
After long contemplation and discussion among peers, I've reached the conclusion that horses are fierce and being faced with 100 duck-sized horses all at once seems like a death sentence. I will go with 1 horse-sized duck. I'm allowed to use a stick as a weapon right? 
I started late in college! Radiohead and Clazziquai from growing up/ James Blake since I started music 
OH BOY. I need to revisit this question probably.. but at the moment it would be Missy Elliott 
Aw thank you! I would say you should just download the trial version of any music making software (in my case I chose Ableton) and start sharing any sketches you make on the internet! Soundcloud was an easy place to start for me.  When I moved to NY, I went to so many shows that I was excited about and naturally met people who make music that way as well! 
Wah thanks!! I'm really hoping so! Not one planned specifically as of now. I'll keep you posted! 
My parents just got divorced and stopped talking to me. Worked out for the best in the end I suppose 
Is that when he quit his job and went on to cook meth?  
By these criteria, I'm a dad, and I'm a 23-year-old with no kids. 
I'd still consider you an artist, just more of a face painter. 
I think OP mentioned it was a motorized easel but now all I see is medieval neck snapper 
Seriously, I've been looking for something to replace what's already in my room, but I've been having such a hard time choosing something that I would actually want. This is it, for sure. 
My dad too. He laid new tile in his bathroom and has yet to glue it down or use grout. It's just sitting on the floor like a giant puzzle. It's been 3 months 
That's his motorized easel he built! That small controller by his foot allows the whole painting to move up and down. Sounds like a fucking banshee when he uses it--there were a lot of nights where I couldn't sleep cause he'd be up painting and using that thing. 
You can tell just reading the card alone was hitting him in the feels. Then when he saw the guitar he couldn't hold it any longer. That a guy who just misses his dad.... 
I'll go John Wick on their ass. I'm way too attached to my guitar that my dad bought me for $20 at a yard sale, and if he'd bought that before he passed away? Holy shit.  
It's been just over 3 years for me, man this hit me right in the tear ducts. 
Born too late to explore the world, too early to explore the galaxy, but just in time to explore Reddit from the porcelain throne.  
Stand up for what's right.  Even if you have to stand alone. 
Tbh I was kinda laughing at the thought of 16 and awkward ass teenager standing there not knowing what to do with himself, shit turned around real quick though.  
I thought this too... a lot of people have mentioned insuring it for some added protection but something like this is priceless. 
I think Seth and I both really want to keep it going 
I misread the first part as Hillary for Charity which sounds like a Hillary Clinton circlejerk gala 
He's like that friend that only texts you once per year to wish you happy birthday, except with a picture of Seth Rogan and he just wishes himself happy birthday. 
I could hear a shorter version echo of this as I looked at each picture - something like:  Ah-huh ^Ah-huh ^^Ah-huh ^^^Ah-huh  
Seth and his wife Lauren started Hilarity for Charity in 2012, HFC spreads awareness and raises money to benefit the alzheimers association. Ive had the opportunity to meet Seth at HFC events and take these pictures over the past four years.  
uh huh huh huh ^uh ^huh ^huh ^huh ^^uh ^^huh ^^huh ^^huh ^^^uh ^^^huh ^^^huh ^^^huh ^^^^uh ^^^^huh ^^^^huh ^^^^huh 
They honestly both look like cardboard cutouts to me. Its weird. 
I think they just meet at an annual charity event that Rogen started. 
OH WHAT, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME I CANT PLAY WITH FIRE WORKS IN A DENSE FORREST?   PFFT 
Honestly, I bet it would help to establish that it was parody and thus fair use.  
How can you prevent forest fires all the way from the arctic circle!?  You interpreted this all wrong!    Only you can prevent the fires!  Not by avoiding forests, but by protecting them with your unawakened ability.  Your great great great great grandfather was a mighty Native American Chief whose name translated to "Smokes with Bears".  He was able to telepathically communicate with all Bears within a 10,000-mile radius.    The Bears were only used for putting out fires that were caused by Lightning, uncontrolled bonfires, and tribal wars.  The keepers of the forrest, 'Smokes with Bears' would use his shaman powers to imbue them with anti-flammable polyester coats so that they would use their bodies to smother all flames.  This is your calling.  Now go smoke with some bears.   
Here's a fun fact. It's actually "Smokey Bear" with no "the" in between. Weird, huh? 
Oh my god! Someone giving credit for their jokes...on Reddit? 
Thats it, ya cant have forest fires if there's no trees. 
That's why they have prescribed burns... putting out your campfire and not tossing cigarette butts should be common sense...but since it's not so common they have to run a campaign with a cartoon character to get people's attention. 
Why don't you donate to a related organization instead? 
Came here to say this.  Lamentably, this comment is way down the page. 
DON'T BRING LOGIC HERE!!  BUT MUH FEELINGSSSSS!!1111 
Not the USFS as a whole, but the Wildland Firefighting portion of the FS has been going up. The USFS as an agency has actually been losing funding under the recent administration. 
You couldn't be more clueless huh? It doesn't have to by a major Forrest.  I was just in KC and they have large sections of trees.  Woods, brush fires etc are what the service has always wanted people to be wary of.   
Fire is actually a very beneficial occurrence for forests in California. The fire suppression management programs used in the 1900s and currently are very counterproductive if the goal is to keep the forests in the natural ecological state they were before human colonization. By preventing every fire you actually allow the build up of more plant fuel (usually burns out in small fires), which leads to more large scale, more intense, and more severe fires. Fires also allow the natural succession process to occur. Not to say infrastructure and homes should not be protected, but fire is a necessity for a healthy forest in California. 
I still think it's important to prevent forest fires by those unskilled to handle it. We started to do controlled burns which allow for new growth and preventing big forest fires.  
Hm yes. The middle east wars are *all* liberals fault.  
I have some good news for you: they haven't been defunded.   I have some bad news for you: only dumb people get their political news from funny tshirts.... 
I can remember the summer where pushing people into the pool died. 
He is just testing a new transition technique; this one is much faster than dismounting and dipping your toes to see how chilly the water is. 
I would argue his only mistake was not letting the umbrella go sooner to have more control of the bike.  But then again, we wouldn't have this wonder gif to laugh at. 
Honestly after watching a few times I don't think he even saw it and the board knocked him of his bike unexpectedly.  
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Umbrella the Damp? 
It's the skateboard "fall" that starts the stink of BS.  
I think that's exactly what we are seeing. Judging by his momentum when he comes into frame, I think he was simply trying to make the turn and didn't see the board in time to avoid it. 
Can't believe it took that long for someone to comment this, what kind of madman skateboards in that kind of weather? 
Mr. /u/SpeakLikeAChild04, are you in bed with russia? The people needs to know. 
Vodka was once banned in Russia, it made tax uncertain and death much more certain  
Try a gin and tonic wiht lime. Moscow mule is a sign of russian hacking the alcohol supply of USA.  
It's likely in a predominantly liberal city, like New York or San Francisco. 
I don't drink smirnoff any more, but I also don't drink it any less either 
Ah yes, surely they'll suffer the unspeakable devastation Target and Starbucks endured. 
Trump says a lot of things. At this point I can only believe what he actually does, nothing he says is reliable on any level. 
I couldn't find a news article on google. Maybe someone with stronger Google-Fu.  
I mean it's vodka. It's not swill* but like any vodka it should be used as an ingredient and not consumed as a drink in itself. That's reserved for sorority girls and eastern Europeans suffering from depression.  *super cheap vodka can have a bit of a funky taste, but above a certain quality threshold it's all about the same. 
I mean... they normally use photoshop or so to touch up the pictures in the ad. :P 
Why does he have to be bald?? Smh scalpal profiling 
1. Cross-post to /r/HailCorporate and /r/AdPorn. 2. Swim in karma.

Very cool owner who buys her the bus pass and enables her to leave on her own!  
She has secretly started a relationship with a local city alderman, who happens to be married, and she spends most of the day down at the rec-centre, which doubles as campaign headquarters, where she cold calls registered voters and directs any packages that may be delivered.   
I'm 22 years in and can't even make it to the dog park by myself.  
I'm having a true blue shit day and I just had the best laugh at this. Many thanks. 
I always feel bad for owners that are stuck at home alone all day while their pets are at the park. 
To be fair, I don't think the dog can do her own laundry either.  That's ok though, dogs don't wear clothes. 
Yea and if you can't handle her bite then you don't deserve her best.  
Everyone knows her and they even did an article on her in the local newspaper.  
Technical there's only one toy in one unless there's a cactus in that cactus that was in the original cactus. 
It's a metaphor. The outside is how I act but peel back the layer to reveal my true self. Me irl  
Barkbox is so legit. My pup had a similar discovery with a dragon toy of theirs from last year where he'd just been destroying it, and then a squeaky ball came out of the head. He looked at me in disbelief and jumped around the ball for a few minutes out of sheer joy 
Yeah bark box does this stuff!! My dog has a toy where it has a ball inside. I think they call them like tuff toys or something of the sort for the purpose of dogs who rips stuff up! I love their stuff! 
Oh yeah, forgot about the flower. She ripped that part off immediately 
You're not alone... getting bombarded by PMs from people accusing me of being a shill.  Rest assured it's just me and one crazy 8 month old golden retriever. 
I assume you're joking, but actually it's true. Which is why Dad should not let Baby do that.  
Difference is the victim in this situation is actually going to fuck his mom. 
That diaper is empty; the line hasn't changed color, and it still has wrinkles that it wouldn't have if it was wet or poopy.  *Source:*  I change diapers. 
Can someone please sync Jim Ross/Jerry Lawler's commentary about Rikishi's finishing move with this gif?    
You can only love them for so long.  Can't believe you lasted this long tbh. 
"And I fuck your mom. Whenever you shut up long enough that is"   *face sitting intensifies*  
Yellow line on the diaper. This gif is a victory if you ask me.  
I thought I was the only one getting butt smashed in the face! 
I showed my wife this gif, and she asked me when I took that video.  We have 2 about that age, and two just a bit older, and she thought it was me.  Maybe I'm your husband's twin brother. 
Kids naturally twerk.  It's like the most basic dance move 
God I love being gay  I'm not getting anyone pregnant! 
I'm also in my early 20s and have a 6 month old. I've gotten baby shit on my fingers and a tiny bit on my face less than an hour ago, by the way. Unless you are an extremely calm and patient person after several months of sleep deprivation, I suggest against it.  
Winston Churchill, while talking about the plight of the British forces in Malakand (1897) he had this to say, "The profession of medicine, and surgery, must always rank as the most noble that men can adopt." 
Weird how we don't hear much about the Manchester incident though? Few weeks later and it feels like it went out of the mediasphere?  
I saw somewhere that there was an initial 2 minute response time for first responders, is this accurate? Pretty amazing if so  
Yes, major credit to the first responders and thank you for all that you do. 
Not to mention PTSD. A client of mine at the charity I work for was stabbed in the shoulder by his brother ten years ago and even bringing it up now makes him get very emotional and overwhelmed. Sometimes the after effects are invisible to the eye but just as impactful. 
It's a misleading title. There were eight deaths as a result. I'm not sure if that makes 56 victims or if the deaths include the attackers making for 53 victims. 
I will never understand why people wouldn't want national health care...  
This needs more credit, the emergency wards that dealt with them and the paramedics are used to serious knife injuries.... We don't as a rule see gunshot wounds, stabbings and glassings are probably weekly for many casualty departments and paramedics in the major cities... 
Cutting policing budgets and legalising fox hunting.. 
Seems fine to be honest. He was being quoted from his hospital bed in a newspaper i read yesterday. Seem's like he's making a full recovery too. 
Pfff. Anyone with any small amount of ingenuity can have that entire haul with little effort. 
No, no, no, it's healthy because there is an apple in their logo... duh! 
Speaking of mimics, we have these treasure chests right? And we have monsters who have evolved to look just like chests Why the fuck do we still make treasure chests that look like them? 
wait you can replicate this? what's maintenance mode?  
There's actually a door on these machines you're meant to stick your hand into to grab the snack can't tell for sure if it's on this one though  
'This is my purpose?  Nope. Nope. Nope.  Take them all, and leave me be.  I need some alone time.' 
No, no, no you have it all wrong. You find the vending machine guy and tell him you are interested in working for the company. The best way to get secrets is from the inside right? So you get a job and little by little you collect money from this company. Eventually you realize you have enough saved up to buy tons of chips, buy a car, support a family, live a good life, etc 
If you break the glass, you can get free chips even if this doesn't happen. 
Finally, after years of not knowing what the second to last step was, we now know what we have to do for Profit; Workers comp!!! It's so simple!!!!! 
I believe you need the /S switch to truly benefit from those stars. 
"You need our new state of the art, weather resistant model. Only $10 plus maintenance fees." 
You can always fight back by making your own sign! You'll save money (probably), keep them off your lawn, AND flip them off with your own sign.  
I thought you were going to say he held up his drill and drilled a hole in their door. Instant peephole! 
What do you use the sign to prevent? Salesmen, or JW's 
Honestly, kids don't understand most of those signs. When I was young I used to think prosecuted meant executed so I took those "violaters will be prosecuted" signs very seriously.  
But he can't knock on their door to sell anything. Short-sighted thinking for a quick buck. 
Yep, waking my sleeping babe is the fastest way to get me to NOT buy anything from you *EVER*. 
It almost certainly *did* come from a craft shop. You can't make something like that at home for under $5. 
Why would he care about future competition when he can't go there anymore either? 
Hi sir, I see you have the 2017 "No Soliciting" sign, have you heard of the new 2018 "no soliciting" sign, with weather stripping and rubber grommets that won't rub on your door? 
I go with the generic "except for kids". Ya some other kids may have chocolate...or pies; we got pies one time and they were good. 
Easiest pitch ever.    "Hi there, I noticed that you don't have a no soliciting sign posted on your property. For the low low price of only $5, you can prevent jerks like me from ever knocking at your door again"! 
I'm sorry, when we moved into our place now we would have about 2 stops a day by solicitors. Bought a sign and have pretty much had peace since.  
I specifically don't buy from them and usually yell at them to help prepare them for the real world. 
One of those pest control guys came by to my house not too long ago in the middle of the night and I told him "Dude it's 8:54, who's stupid enough to bother people in this time of day. Get off my property". And he left staring at the house with a look of what I can only call disgust. 
Lol this is my exact thought process, drives my wife batshit when she comes home from work at 1130pm and I'm asleep with the TV on. Used to be a DVD menu screen looping over and over, now it's a "continue watching" button being slowly burned into the screen.  Best is when she turns it off and I immediately wake up and tell her I was watching it.  Ive become so accustomed to falling asleep with the TV on that I can't sleep without it anymore. I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing but it is what it is lol. 
In all seriousness this post made me happy to know I'm not alone when it comes to irrational Sunday anxiety that sets in when I still have 30% of my weekend left.  The dumbest part is that around noon Monday I remember for the billionth time that while weekdays aren't as much fun as weekends, my life is fucking fine. 
"Hi, hello? Hi, yes. I'm sad to report that I won't be able to come in tomorrow. Why? Oh, yes. Uh. I'm dead. I've died. Very sad. I should be better by Tuesday, yes. Ok. Thank you. I will, bye." 
I had that thought too! We can work out some possibilities though based on the Netflix line and the fact that it says "night" in the title. If each show is 22 minutes, and night starts at what, 5:00, 6:00... Yeah I'm gonna need a little help here. Return to your increasing panic! 
Right before bedtime when you set your alarm and realize it will be going off in four hours, after you tell yourself all weekend that THIS will be the week you start with a good night's sleep. :( 
1 "panic"- gradual curve up from the origin   2 "likelihood of going on that run"- small downward curve   3 "Netflix shows watched"- staircase   4 "sex had"- line running along the bottom   5 "will to live"- big downward curve 
Where the hell are there 36 kids in a class, so I know never to go there? 
Same! I stopped watching TV to get ready for bed, yet here I am. 
But his panic curve is exponential meaning it will continue approaching infinity. Yours being constant means you are okay at managing it. 
Plus I'm not even sure the Netflix line is a function.  
You're brave and strong and smart, and will get through it. And then it will be over!  
This is usually how it ends up - which is a mistake on Monday.... 
Sunday mornings are nice. It's all downhill after 12pm though. 
Find a job you actually want to go to or that will probably be there forever.  
Because it is shows watched, so a show has to complete them the number boosts up, so that line couldnt be gradually declining but rather every 20 mins or 40 mins it bumps up to another level of # of shows watched  
I get a similar reaction when I approach women at the bar. 
I'm an 18 year old man only interested in people who are interested in men ages 25-40.  Finally a dating site that suits my needs /s 
Im 31 so 22 is ok for me to date? Hooray for college girls with low self esteem 
More like the site taking a screenshot and sending it to the FBI. 
Say what you want about pedophiles, but at least they drive slowly in school zones. 
Well that's just not fair. Everyone knows you go to adult friend finder for that. 
If she's 39 now, there's still a chance that she'll turn 40 this year, and everyone knows that's the age where women begin the process of slowly turning into piles of dust.  Source: Oil of Olay commercials.

Sylvester Jr.'s interactions with his father (like that one) are so funny. 
This definitely made me miss both of my grandmothers. I lost one last year (at the age of 97!) and my other one is still alive but dementia has wasted her away. I love them both so much. :( 
people get older every year and new people come to the internet looking for entertaining material. I dont stop watching movies because they have been out for a few years due to the age and i can still find older stuff on internet still interesting. 
Not everybody. My grandfather bought a live rabbit and duck to the San Diego Comic Con. Let them loose and tried hunting them down.  
Dude, they're _still_ airing some of these cartoons. 
Extremely highly upvoted repost with a clickbait title. Something smells fishy. 
I think I'm the only one who *didn't* enjoy the Sylvester DLC.  :(      Too fetchquesty for my taste! 
But the best one EVER? Apparently they all are the best one ever. It's like those recipes where it's "Best cookies in the universe" or "brownies that will make you slaughter your family".  
That's actually a good idea.   Disney is just about worn out.  
I spent an afternoon with Adam West in about '95 shooting a celebrity test drive article for bikini magazine. We shot it up by the old batcave entrance in Griffith Park. The coolest thing was his voice. It just drips coolness. 
Another good cameo is the Brave and the Bold episode Chill of the Night! where he plays Thomas Wayne.   (Also features Kevin Conroy as the Phantom Stranger in a wager with Mark Hamill as the Spectre)  
Was too young to enjoy his older work but I loved him in family Guy. RIP mayor West :( 
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb -  Adam West 
Adam West was the batman we deserved, just not the one we needed 
Seems like he knew how to make and take a joke on himself. Was always a joy on the show. RIP :( 
A Batman? West actually believed he was *the* Batman. 
Where did you hide that he didn't know you were there week after week?  
You do realize the show is an intentional comedy right?  
I will never forget his role as Catman in Fairly odd parents. That was the first role I saw him in. 
Growing up in the 1990's, I was (and still am) a huge Batman fan. One weekend FX had a marathon of the old Batman series and my uncle taped about a dozen episodes for me. I watched them so much my mom plotted to destroy the tape just so she didn't have to hear the nananana Batman! theme again. I just adored his version of Batman and how he got out of all those menacing traps. Truly a cherished childhood memory. Thanks Mr. West.  
Ralph Garman already took care of that a year or two ago. 
I like the zoom in at the beginning. Quality camera work. 
I think it's hilarious that human babies are the opposite, and just think they have it under control but if we let them they would injure themselves horrible attempting the stairs. 
Agreed. That lookaround: "Did anyone else see that?" 
I think I somehow heard that dogs mind explode during that gif. 
In my internal reading of this, Doggo was voiced by Sam Elliott.  
You must extract the file first, but you used up your free trial of WinZip :( 
You're going to get downvoted but ill stand by you while it happens. "Doggo" is super cringeworthy.  
After reading this and reading the OP I can confidently say I had a momentary freak out over how weird the word "one" looked.  
If we've done a full 360 we should just call it the Xbox 360... we haven't used that name yet, right? 
And follow up with an Xbox 6s, then an Xbox 6s Plus. 
Thank you I was really hoping I wasnt alone in feeling like I don't recognize the word 'one'. 
Yo dawg I heard u like Xbox, SO WE PUT YOUR XBOX ONE X IN AN XBOX ONE X BOX 
Or when he explained Super Saiyan to Majin Buu.   "And this is to go EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!" 
wait till samsung starts making gaming consoles directly 
They were convinced everyone was going to call it "The One" because they were totally full of themselves.    People will still call it the xbone, or the catching xXxbonexXx 
Omg!!!! Me too!!! Truthfully. Did you just smoke a bowl? 
That was never its real name it was a code name, just like [Nintendo Nx] for the Nintendo switch, even though Nx sounds cooler 
You know Microsoft. The next console is gonna be called Project Pluto, and then when it comes out, it's gonna be the Xbox Two. 
Kind of in-between like the new 3DS was to the 3DS. Not an entirely new generation, but not just a small upgrade either.

"I wish to stop hallucinating genies."  "Wish granted. Looks like I'm real after all. There goes your last wish!"

Reminds me of the saying a good carpenter never blames his tools. 
Hey thank you so much!! I have heard wonderful things about your city 
Instead of second guessing his wish after being confronted by the genie about it, he defends his wish, so the wish was granted. Hence the understanding in the 4th frame. 
The man wants to be more sure of his decisions, genie asks if he wants to waste his wish on this, the man says yes this is what he wants, this implies that he never needed a wish at all, it was inside him all along.  
The genie tried to question the quality of the guy's wish. Instead of second guessing himself, the guy starts to defend his wish, and then realizes that the genie had already granted it. 
Hey thank you!! I know there has been an attempt to make Texas stickers for messaging, done sometime after my original posting - but yes, you're not alone in wishing for an actual set! (Along with some of my extended TX family!)

Lower the tripod like 1cm and it wouldn't tilt me by having the leaf touch the peak.   Amazing photo, but that choice.. 
 Beautiful Fugi.  Will be my new screen saver.  Thanks a lot op. 
you know I almost didn't click the comments for this, because I wasn't sure if the reference would reach out that far.  I was mistaken. 
felt the same.... birds and canopy of trees is either REALLY far away, or the lower half is shopped in reflection 
Hey now, stop that you    That's not how you make Haiku    It's snowing on Mount Fuji. 
I was trying to figure out what was so off-putting about a photo that seemed fine enough. 
Man, it's one thing to be interested in cultures with rich histories.  It's another altogether to wear cat ears and learn a dozen Japanese words to pepper into your English. 
It's not the tree itself but the ratio. There is too much tree. The tree and the reflection form a natural vignette but its off center and the mountain is not framed correctly.  Humans enjoy mathematical patterns. This is where the rule of thirds comes from and while the rule of thirds may be overly simplistic the reason it works is the same reason most rules of composition work and that's because a balance of symmetry and focus are vital to a good picture.  All the photographer needed to do was take this from about a foot lower. The mountain would have been framed and the tree would take up the right percentage of the image. The leading lines of the mountain would not be broken and the intense orange of the leaves would not distract from the dull whites of the mountain top which should be the focus in the this image not the tree.    
Hakone is awesome. This is about an hour drive from Hakone, if you want to make the trip.

Don't forget the announcement of "Elder Scrolls Online: Seattle."  At some point it will literally be the only place left to milk for more money. 
Do you get to the Oort Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying? Of course you don't. 
For the 6th time, but it's really completely different now, gib money plz. 
And when you make the game, they monetize it, and you get to keep 25% of the profit. 
Seriously. It's almost 6 years old. Give us something new, God damn it.  
Yeah they'll probably switch the title around, *Skyrim: The Elder Scrolls*  And the next TES will be *Skyrim VI* 
Yeah skyrim was like my entire freshmen year of high school...I'm a junior in college now I want something else to waste my education on  
All they had to say was "whenever we release FO5, it'll have the old dialogue option system with choices that matter" and I'd be praising them to no end right now.  
the Chief staff feed him life force if they think he's done a good job. It's all that sustains him now 
when has a lack of story or believable characters gotten in their way, let's be honest 
Feels a little to me like they're stalling, like whatever they're working on is coming along more slowly than they'd prefer. 
Nah, everyone loved Morrowind, right? Why not use the same 15 year old engine with a few updates?/s 
Judging from everything we know right now, it's *barely* in pre-development 
Uh sorry you forgot about Doom, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, and Prey!   /s 
You can probably already stream Skyrim from your PC onto a smartwatch, since you can stream it with a phone. Skyrim running on the watch itself is probably less than a decade away (Assuming that smartwatches don't die out). 
so we'll have people on Mars by the time it comes out? 
In fairness, Capcom also made three new main series Resident Evil games (their quality notwithstanding) since then, plus a couple RE spin-offs and dozens of non-RE games.  Has Bethesda developed anything substantial since Skyrim aside from Fallout 4? (I would say Dishonored, but I'm almost certain they only published that.) 
I mean, the graphics of Fallout 4 weren't anything groundbreaking like Skyrim was. (which I'm okay with) They just focused on widening the audience way too much, unfortunately. A disturbing trend in new Bethesda games. 
the argument goes that ESO counts as an installment in 2014.  
Ehh, I don't think the other guys are too scared. They appear to have semi automatic weapons. 
There are some animals I might try and shoo if they stand in the road.  That gorilla is not one of them. 
Gorilla remains have been found in Leopards. A lion pride could also likely take down a silverback but they're not about to do that unless they're starving. Big cats have better group tactics, ~~stronger~~  similar (1000psi vs 1300psi) bite force and claws. 
So... a Silverback gorilla isn't just a species of gorilla?   
I read dad gorrilla's line in mufasa's voice which made me think a lion king-esque gorilla movie could be very cool! 
"I wish to survive this apocalypse by living underwater somewhere in Scotland!"   
We say that this is a rare event, but this is the 4th time I've seen this comment on an /r/funny thread in the past 2 days 
The real LPT is always in the comments.  BRB, Choking on some cucumber water. 
As the fame of op grows over time, the pressure on him equally heightens. Until one day op is consumed by the anguish that he will never make an original piece as great as his first. Defeated by his inner demons, he browses the top posts of the year on funny and submits them again... Hoping to feel how he felt the first time.  
Its translated for those of you who do not speak dino. 
This is like Anakin bringing balance to The Force via the death of the Jedis. 
she was running away from him and he launched himself to catch her. too funny! 
A classmate's dog did something similar to me when I was 6 (same size dog as in the video), knocked me straight on my ass and started licking my face. My friend's mother, who was walking the dog, was terrified I was hurt, but I just laughed it off and played with the dog. Dogs are awesome.  
You are not alone. It's new to me.  And I just kept laughing and thinking "Mooove, bitch! Get out the way!" 
Imagine how scary wolves were 10000 years ago. No wonder we hid in caves.  
I'm curious too. That looks like a new Mexico lobos football sweater from about 2002-2003 that the players received. 
First guess is that this was cute when the dog was a small puppy, and it never unlearned the behavior. 
But that's the thing.. wood floors tell a story... 
Hope your week gets better! I proper lol'd on that one. Definitely gave me a happy  
Its India.   Their movies are "all emotions and genre at once" and their food is "all spices at once".     
Yeah I can't believe nobody else noticed this..look at the green of the trees. The color saturation is cranked WAY up. Every other photo of this kind of squirrel on google without color editing is just brown and red and a little yellow  
Visit any nearby sanctuary or forest area. Its common . 
It is heavily edited in Photoshop. The colors are not this strong IRL. Saturation is cranked up like crazy.  
he seems to be answering the comments on his videos pretty quickly, maybe try asking him there? 
I saw 2 $500s since then,  those individuals are worth noting as well. 
He now has over $12,000, and over 3k subscribers!  
Where's the link? I'm on mobile and can't find it anywhere. 
It truly is amazing seeing all these people show support for this guy. This is a light in a seemingly dark world.  
Contact him on YouTube. He is responsive there! Up vote so it's seen.  
Agreed, I've never really given to a GoFundMe but after watching his video and my eyes started sweating, how could I not just throw in ten bucks?  
It's in the description of that Youtube Video.  Comments with a direct link don't appear due to Rule 5, which is why there are a lot of replies to this comment that can't actually be loaded. 
Hey I shot you a PM about Canine Companions for Independence, an organization that provides service dogs free of charge. I have raised service dogs for them in the past, and I know how life changing they can be. 
No man, thank YOU. Thanks for sharing your feelings. It means a lot to me. Life becomes a lot better when we connect like this together. 
Very curious to see where the dust will settle on this one.  I think things are going to be surprisingly easier for Kevin for awhile 
Now that he has passed the goal I can almost guarantee the impact is less about the dollar value and more about the true volume of people who are loving him.   They will spend the money but they will never forget all the strangers whom he will never meet that showed him what love and kindness is. 
Wait, does health insurance usually pay for someone's car?is that a normal thing in other countries? 
He's been slow playing it for 9 years and he's ready to strike!  
No the horse is thinking, if she keeps kicking me I am going to die 
My horse broke a(nother) halter yesterday because the hose was obviously about to eat him.  It's not like I've been giving him baths at least once a year for the past 13 years or anything. 
Thank you, thank you for making me aware of something I literally never thought about until now. Added to the checklist of shit not to do around horses. 
It's like she's not even trying. Like...just jump a little bit. Just swinging your leg over obviously isn't working so put a little more hop into it with your left leg. She looked like somebody throwing themselves at a hooked wall while wearing a velcro suit....except the wall isn't hooked and there is no suit.  
Some horses are very helpful though. I grew up with on my mom called "The sitter" because he was super gentle and helpful with kids and beginners. He'd use his neck to to nudge you on, and he would not trot or canter until you were actually ready.   I remember a friend riding him who was super unbalanced. He didn't trot for a solid 30 minutes until my friend got used to being on a horse. Then when he did start to run and my friend slipped to one side the horse would stop, spread his legs out and wiggle his back as needed to "catch" the rider.   I miss that horse, That was my mom's first baby. She had him longer than she's had me, and I'm 20 now.  
"Oh ffs Linda, can't you do anything on your own?" 
Just want to say that I grew up horseback riding and can confirm that fly mounting is incredibly difficult. 
What does having bare feet have to do with riding bareback and getting a pelvic crushed? 
"This thread is weirdly aggressive..."  "No shit"  And the cycle continues. 
i dunno wtf is wrong with her, im like 3x her weight and i can pull myself on one, she had zero spring to her jump and was just pivoting 
Yeah she was just pretending, it wasn't exactly needed though because with the cuts it's easy to tell the horse only lays down on command. Jumping on a horse really isn't that hard unless you're too small or overweight (and this girl clearly isn't) when it's standing completely still like that, even someone who has never been on a horse will instinctively use the horse mane to pull himself.  
Worked as a gas station cashier for a stint after college, this is so true. I have a decent collection of silver coins because of these people. 
Coin shop.  If they have a moral objection,  try another coin shop.  If you have a moral objection, a jeweler or metallurgist can reclaim the silver. 
I've got a friend who's an expert nazi, let me call him up 
15. PM or right fucking here.   I'll outbid you you inaz 
The Nazis produced a lot of currency especially over occupied territory during the war so it's probably not that hard to find especially at militaria shows. 
No, you see, you have to end it something like: "My advice would be to take this to an appraiser immediately. He'll be able to give you much more information than I could given that I specialize in coins from around 1998 when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell. 
Maybe put it behind some glass, on a pedestal.  Maybe dedicate a room to it with other Nazi related historical finds.  You could get some flags and put them up around the walls.    You wouldn't want people going through your junk drawer to get the wrong idea. 
"Sand on my paws and sand on my tail, where is this you've bought me?" I ask with a meow.   Shh says my human. Just dance, look amused. I remind myself later to poop in his shoes.     
"I'll allow this because you feed me, but you should definitely expect a new scratch in the couch come morning." 
Haha thank you! Do it! Some good variations that she also doesn't respond to are Bunsiewoo, Bun Bun Face and The Bundertaker :) 
The internet is a wonderful place. You can stumble upon albino midgets shitting on each other more than once, but a dancer with a cat on the beach? Never. (Except now obviously) 
I have been scrolling for so long, I had almost lost hope that someone else would be reminded of this.  
She has a harness and a leash but, she's not very fast and in this case preferred to stay in her carrier facing away from the water. Did not care where her tuna comes from. 
I'm long past the point of shame.  This isn't even in the same galaxy as my most shameful fap.  This is the complimentary mint I take without even thinking before I move on to my main courses.  I won't even remember this fap. 
More like... "Dang, we're out of kitty litter. Wait, we're just 12 minutes from the beach!" 
" hey i know you are sad, but im really hungry. can this not be about you for a second and you just feed me?" 
Same here. Most of my cat's life was hiding under beds, but if someone was upset he'd always come find you and comfort you. Weird yet awesome. 
I believe Russian Blues are put on this earth to bridge dog people into cat people. Same thing happened with my husband. He hated cats because he was allergic to them. I brought home a Russian Blue since they are hypoallergenic. They are now best buds. Our cat is his home office assistant, lap warmer and confidant.  
I'm so sorry having to lose your little guy. I know it's cliche, but he isn't in pain anymore, but I know it still hurts. Stay strong

The same way we understand how animals are generally feeling. They learn to understand the sounds we make, our expressions and behavior, and for those pets with sensitive noses, can also smell chemical changes and the like. 
Aw. I had a dog who would do the same whenever my dad was throwing a temper tantrum. He knew I was scared and he didn't seem to care how mad my dad was. 
One of mine came matter-of-factly mewing at my bedroom door last week when my two-year woke up crying in the middle of the night.  I guess I wasn't moving fast enough for her high, cat standards. 
That is really special and I'm glad you're still here.  
There have been so many moments in my life where I am truly sick of having to deal with humans. Pets don't give a shit about whether you're getting good grades or what kind of clothes you wear, they just love you. 
Agreed. You need to earn their trust and treat them well and they will do the same in return, just like a normal person. I mean some humans don't even have any dignity or self respect for themselves so.  
I've never understood the cat/dog schism. I feel like they're both awesome pets/animals with wide appeal so it seems weird that so many people put themselves into these weird camps. 
I relate. They are angels. Your story made me cry.
