what was your thought when you got hit in the head with the flag while performing at the oscars? (which you handled amazingly, didn't even stop for a second) loved moana, i listen to soundtrack almost everyday.
moana was animated, but do you still ever get recognized in public?
what was your favorite part about working with dwayne "the rock" johnson?
what are the best and worst aspects of finding such great success at a young age?
first, a big thank you! moana is an amazing character and my son (3) adores the movie. moana is an instant classic and one so many future films will be compared to. were any of your parts ad libbed, or changed on the spot due to your own personality or unexpected things that happened on set? thanks!
omg!!! a live ama *and* it's someone that i'm a huge fan of! questions.... what's your favorite ice cream flavor? what music have you been listening to recently? what's your favorite book? what's the best advice you've ever gotten? thanks for this ama!! you're a huge inspiration for my little cousins, they want to be just like you when they grow up :)
how awesome is lin manuel miranda? did he get you hamilton tickets?
first of all, i'd just like to say amazing work on moana! you've got incredible talent for one so young (i can't believe you're younger than me by a few months!!) now for my question. do you have a life motto? if so, what is it?
where is your favorite place to go out and enjoy in hawaii?
congratulations on being the first polynesian disney princess! it's really amazing that little girls can look up to someone who looks more like them which was something i never had when i was young. what's your favourite dessert?
what was your and your family/friends reaction when you were cast as a lead in a disney animated film as your first major acting role? had to feel insane. thanks!
how exactly do you pronounce your name? and what are the worst pronunciation of it you've had?
coolest place you've ever travelled to? haven't seen moana yet but your singing at oscars was great!
how has being cast as moana changed your life? this is my four year old daughters favorite movie right now (and mine too)!
what's your favourite line or song lyric from the movie?
where do you think *moana* ranks out of all the disney movies? i mean, i'm not asking you to talk smack about *home on the range* or anything, but everyone has a favourite...
can you speak to how accurately pacific cultures were portrayed in moana? how much liberty did scriptwriters and animators take?
hello auli'i! :) based on your last name, do you have any portuguese heritage?
what's been the best experience you've had with a fan?
do you think moana represents a new kind of disney movie, where the heroine doesn't need a love interest or to be pursuing/evading one? did you get that impression while working on the movie?
hi auli'i! i've been singing moana on my way to class for so long now, thank you for making this movie magical! as the newest disney princess, what other disney princess is your favorite and why? thanks for doing the ama!!
after performing the national anthem, whats next on your bucket list?
everyone's asking serious questions about your career. i just want to know, what's your favorite sandwich?
what would you credit with being the source of your poise and composure? you performed so well at the oscars, even with a slight flag-related mishap! i hope great things await you in life!
would you rather fight one lin manuel miranda sized duck or 100 duck sized lin manuel mirandas?
what are you planning to do next career wise (other than sing the national anthem)?
why didn't pua get more screen time? do you agree with the #justiceforpua movement?
i'm really interested in microbiology, and law! the possibilities after graduating from high school are endless.
yes! the response to our film has been so wonderful and positive, and i'm always surprised and grateful when i am recognized as the voice of moana. :)
the crazy thing is, after watching the behind the scenes stuff, we think she actually does look like moana! i know she was drawn before she was cast, but she fits her so well and really resembles the character. we'd recognize her immediately!
my favorite part would have to have been during our press tour, he was so kind and sort of a mentor that i could look to for help.
what a bittersweet story. i'm sorry for your loss, and i hope your daughter grows up as strong as her mother, father and moana :)
being 16 i know i have a lot to learn in many areas; my career being one of them. i've had once in a life time opportunities and experiences, and i've also missed family functions and friend's birthdays. i think keeping an open mind is really important for any type of success.
thank you! there were more than a few parts i ad libbed. i have a natural tendency to make weird flabbergasted noises and somehow they worked with the film!! yay!! p.s. please tell your son i said hello!!
thank you so much!! -vanilla bean -the entire dear evan hansen album -aesop's fables -always pre-treat a stain before washing. always.
thank you so much! it's so important to have heroines our younger generation can look up to. i know being 16 myself, i look up to moana as well! alsooo.... (this is a very hard question btw) key lime pie. :)
is lilo (in *lilo and stitch*) not considered at least part polynesian?
performing at the oscars will be something i will never forget. i still vividly remember being so. nervous!!! it was a new experience working through those nerves and giving everything to my performance, and it worked out pretty well!
ow - like you stubbed your toe lee - like bruce lee and add another ee ow-lee-ee
london! i worked on my accent on the plane over and everything. p.s. moana is coming to netflix!!! check it out!!!
i might be a little biased, but i'd say it's pretty high up there.
as a polynesian, i personally thought it was perfect. especially the size the make islanders, my dad practically looks like maui.
there's a documentary on the blu-ray that does a great job going over this. the ~~writers~~ crew actually spent ~~3~~ 5 years travelling to various islands in the pacific doing research.
as a pacific islander, i'd say the movie was amazing but a little inconsistent in how it pulled together all of the different pacific cultures. i understand disney went to great efforts to consult cultural experts and advisors, so that's a super positive. but it was never going to be perfect, trying to pull together a bunch of cultures to tell a story.
i am interested in this one-- also what is your background, was the maui myth something you grew up with? i have a hawaiian buddy who adored this movie but i'm not sure if it's more "any representation is better than none" or "disney knocked it out of the park on this"
one time i met this baby (i'd say around 3 years old) and he was crying super super hard and his parents were like "omg you're about to meet moana can you please relax and take a nice picture" and he did. like fully stopped crying and looked up at me with his face and was like "moana?" and. i. loved it.
pineapple. i'm a total 'pineapple on pizza' kind of person.
new kind of disney princess movie. big hero six, etc etc etc with male protags have always had the option to ignore romance editing to add lilo, although that was not a princess movie, it was a buddy adventure.
waitttt... mulan? or merida? there are others but i forgot heh
mulan was my favorite disney princess growing up. i recognized from a young age that she was breaking gender roles, and i also really loved that she had a talking dragon as a friend.
well after performing on the oscars and performing the national anthem, next thing on my bucket list is going skydiving.
i'm in a tv showwww!!!! it's new to nbc and it's called rise!!!! if you can tell by the number of exclamation points, i am super-de-duper excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
drawn before she was cast? most animated films have the dialogue recorded before they start animating.
oh my god thank you for replying this is the greatest day of my life!!
my crush on you just got larger. (it's ok reddit, i'm not 18 yet)
she wasn't a princess, it was more buddy adventure film. moana is specifically, albeit subtlely, identified as a princess.
you did great - i remember watching and being super impressed at how composed you were, at 16 on that stage!
absolutely true. my step dad used to work at disney and he once took me through the backstage entrance to test track. i was young, but i remember it being behind the counter in the gift shop.
i was lucky enough to get a vip guide. basically even the staff working on the rides don't know half of what entails a vip status! you get shuttled from attraction to attraction through the back entrances in a complimentary car. our tour guide's name was josh and the vip tours he did mostly was for the make a wish kids! really awesome experience and josh made the experience even better
i saw this happen actually. we were next in line for the figment ride at epcot. one of the vip guides appears with josh gad (aka olaf from frozen) and a small group of 4-5 other people and they just breezed past the line to the front. they waited a couple of minutes for the next set of riders to get on that were literally boarding as they walked up, then they just went ahead, got on the ride, and that was it. nothing rude or celebrity-ish about it, they just quietly went to the front of the line and got on. i would imagine being famous at a place like disney would be miserable without the vip thing, especially if you are just trying to take your kids or something.
is your surname of portuguese origin? it is very similar to carvalho, a common portuguese surname, meaning oak tree.
what's hilarious was when a bunch of mainlanders got upset and we're all "they are stereotyping with maui." uh. maui literally looks and talks like every samoan braddah on this island.
which thank god they did. the tribe used in pocahontas actually offered their help and disney told them to fuck off. which is why you have songs that don't make sense and ancestor worship that didnt exist.
are you referencing the random times maui would start doing the haka? something about that always felt a little off to me, like it was forced in because it's been getting a lot more media attention in recent years.
the one thing that threw me off was the introduction of maori culture. maui doing a haka, the use of maori vocabulary like mata nui. granted, i began my knowledge search of the language from the bionicle series so it's rather piecemeal, but that's rather odd.
my wife grew up in hawaii and the maui myths were something you learned in school kinda. the movie takes a bunch of different stories from different culture, there were maui stories from native hawaiian, samoan, tongan, etc etc. from my limited knowledge of the stories moana takes bits from each culture as they weren't all the same.
moana = leslie knope, confirmed. also my daughter now wants waffles because moana likes them. time to buy a waffle maker.
one of us. one of us. one of us. i knew there had to be more than my mom and i liking pineapple on pizza
moana is my favorite disney film in years. the music and the themes are the best i've seen since the lion king. i didn't really care for frozen, tangled was okay, brave was meh, but moana absolutely blew me away. how far i'll go is such a wonderful song and your performance knocked it out of the park. thanks for helping to bring such a fantastic movie to life.
well mulan had the hots for her commander guy, but yeah merida is also a good example
you may want to edit your original post and put in some info about rise so people know about it then. :)
i wish some of the songs were longer so i can cry more with crazy grandma.
moana is not a princess, just the daughter of the chief.
i was just unsure about the criteria of how moana would be considered a princess while lilo was not. could be age, could be "princess-like" mannerisms, could be any number of things. was just asking for the record.
imagine being 16 and performing on-stage on live tv. oh yeah, the other people performing are sting, john legend, and jt. glhf
that door in the gift shop also leads to the chevy employee lounge! formerly the gm lounge. that's another cool thing about epcot, there are hidden lounges scattered throughout the park for the companies that sponsor the rides. a lot of them sit dormant now, however.
disney is pretty decent about learning from their past criticisms. another thing they did, nearly every actor in the film is voiced by someone of polynesian descent. the only non-polynesian is the white guy who played both the chicken and the guy who wanted to eat the chicken.
li shang! i get it if you're talking about love interests in the film. but shang reeeaaaaalllyyyyy didn't play a huge part in the end. you know, when she was nopetynopethisshit to matchmaking, going to war in place of her father, training her chinese ass off, actually fighting, and then going up against big angry mongolian.
i think it's amazing someone would come here just to talk to us, and not bother promoting the new project. we really don't always need to talk about rampart.
i'm not even sure alexander hamilton himself could get them at this point.
but she's part of the line of disney princesses, the same way pocahontas, who was also a daughter of a chief, is.
because disney said so. also, elsa isn't a princess. she's a queen (but disney still considers her a princess). heck, mulan was no where near being a royalty, but she is considered a princess by disney too.
criteria for becoming a disney princess: 1. be the female lead in an original disney movie. (i.e. you're not eligible if you were introduced in a sequel.) 2. one of the following: * be born royal. * marry into royalty. * achieve a great act of heroism. *unofficial, unspoken criterion #3:* your movie must be a commercial success. so while lilo checks off the first and the (unofficial) third criteria, she was not deemed to have met the second.
the guy who sang that was in a show called flight of the concords which is full of goofy songs similar to that style.
does anybody else get a bowie vibe from this song?
but we know and care, and isn't that more important to have the admiration of the internet strangerhood?
kiida should be a disney princess, she matches every requirement. yet disney doesn't recognize her because atlantis wasn't successful in theaters.
i'm still salty about kida nedakh not being considered an official "disney princess". she fits every criteria for the status even more than many of the other "princesses". all except a successful boxoffice run. atlantis has done much better on the home video market over the years and aged better than some other disney movies, but she's still not a disney princess. bloody travesty. people keep saying that merida was the first strong princess from disney, but kida was as forthright and came years before.
lilo fought space invaders and taught them the value of family. all while teach an alien creation how to love... how is that not an act of heroism???
well he was talking about backroom deals for vips.
he also was 'fart' who sang goodbye moonmen in the little known show rick and morty.
and he's really excellent in legion. also...he was boris the animal in mib 3. he's kind of a chameleon.
as a 37 year old man this is my cry schedule every time i watch this movie. (which is a lot having kids) most hilarious cry is the ancestor scene for me. my wife is like "wtf can you possibly be crying about?" me: "i'm...i'm just so proud of them."
it's also something i've heard when arguing about disney princesses for as long as i can remember. "pocahontas and mulan aren't real princesses!" no, they're not, but disney made them part of the official princess line.
because disney chose not to make her part of the official a princess line. there is an official line. i don't know why they didn't choose lilo.
atlantis will probably always be my favorite disney movie, by far. both it and treasure planet just ooze with style and personality in a way few western animated movies do. such a shame they never got the attention they deserved.
greasing palms with fast passes. drain the swamp!!!!
yessssss i felt like the two songs sounded way too similar but my friends never shared my sentiment
god, i love what we do in the shadows. i found it just browsing netflix, best accidental awesomeness ever.
right there with you. i can usually be ok through those scenes, but the dreamy ancestor scene when she's becalmed after maui leaves is sure to get me going, and nif somehow i make it through with dry eyes i will be guaranteed to lose it when moana is striding towards ta-ke, singing gently. crap. tearing up now.
38 year old dad of a 3.5 year old: the feels in that scene.... "this is not who you are; i know who you are."
what job shocked you the most by finding out how awful it really was?
hey mike, what profession have you gained the most respect for over the years?
why do you still choose to live moderately even though you have made enough money to not do so? i saw the emails online that people send you and you reply and you sent a guy a picture of your view outside your apartment and there is a smokestack outside of it. why are you so humble??! huge fan thanks so much for doing this ama!!
hey mike! if you had to choose one job to do permanently, out of all the ones you tried out on dirty jobs, what would it be? also, your voice is what i imagine gods voice sounds like
i really appreciate the work you do for trade activism, and the revival of blue collar trades. as someone who lives in alberta, canada where the trades seem to flourish, what are the biggest obstacles in the fight against the decline of the blue collar trades in the states?
hi mike! where are you? and are you aware there is a guy sleeping behind you?
hey, mike! thank you so much for dirty jobs. it changed the way i look at the american industry. do you keep in touch with any of the people you met at any of your dirty jobs?
mike, have you ever considered being a walmart employee on black friday for one of your shows? after all, somebody's gotta do it; and, considering the language and throws i've seen on bf, it can be a pretty dirty job.
hey mike, always wondered..ever had an experience with a ghost?
if you went to a guidance counselor in high school, what would he/she have said your ideal job would be?
if you could have drink with one person (dead or alive) who would it be and why?
mike! in all of your shows, i've never seen you do any bits behind the scenes for the medical field. did you ever think about the people who fix the machines that keep people alive? somebody's got to do it, just saying.
hi mike! i have many fond memories of watching dirty jobs with my dad. thanks for the entertainment! 1. what was your favorite dirty job and why? 2. if i ever finish my novel, will you narrate the audio version of it??
legend has it you are so friendly you can thaw a frozen heart and cook an egg just with your warm greeting. it is said your secret technique is the mike rowe wave. ___ i thought up that joke (albeit slightly different when not told to the man himself) a few months ago and have been hoping you would do an ama so i could tell it! you're a pretty humorous guy so i'm hoping you aren't a pun hater. *actual question:* do you start singing opera for no particular reason while doing other things, the way someone would with humming?
do you only get on reddit for ama's or do you actively browse?
how did your adorable quadped fred catch your attention and become lucky enough to be rescued?
are those your real parents in the paper towel commercials? they seem awfully nice.
my son is 6-1/2 (and currently on the couch with a stomach bug.) how should i steer him so he successfully launches into a usable career in 12 more years? i'm an it nerd, so i don't know much about the trades, and i don't know what jobs will be available in a decade... thoughts?
many jobs appear bad at a glance, only to get much worse at a second glance. and some jobs simply get worse and worse with every subsequent glance, which is why (of course) many people watch the program with their eyes closed. i was never in a position to close *my* eyes, and consequently, i enjoyed a front-row seat to a great variety of pits, and holes, that most people simply don't know exist. one brief example might be the interior of an ocean buoy. in the coast guard, buoy tenders are responsible for hoisting these giant steel contraptions out of the ocean, and refurbishing them. in this case, "refurbishment" means *"crawling into a woefully inadequate tube not much larger than the space taken up by your shoulders, and wiggling your way like a worm into the shadowy depths whereupon you begin to remove the barnacles and various other forms of nautical life with a stick or some other improvised tool."* i could go on, but i won't.
if mike isn't interested, i'm in the baltimore area and i'd certainly like to learn more...
at the risk of sounding overly earnest (and too metaphorical), i'm going to say: **the welder.** welders not only work their asses off, they're in high demand, and critical to polite society. the entire world, including our infrastructure, and the building in which i currently find myself, is held together with welds. remove the welder retroactively from the species, and the *whole thing* shits the bed.
you're welcome. i'm not really humble, i'm just not properly acquisitive. i take more pleasure in saving than spending. and like the native americans, i tend to look at "ownership" as something more akin to stewardship. in other words, the more things you own, the more *things* own *you.* on a practical level, i find if you don't have the space for a lot of stuff, you don't wind up with a lot of stuff.
*hmmm.* personally, i've never had the ability to do the same job for more than a few days at a time. clean, dirty, exciting, or tedious. i simply don't have the wherewithal to stick with one vocation too long. it is, without question, a character flaw. regarding the creator's larynx, i agree that he (or she) must certainly possess a rich, well-modulated baritone. however, for reasons that involve the screen actor's guild, i must be perfectly clear about the fact that it isn't mine.
the short answer is: **perception.** the number of people who depend upon a workable infrastructure and a skilled trade force are coincidentally the same number of people who currently inhabit the planet. for a long list of reasons, parents, teachers, and guidance counselors have begun to emphasize one specific form of education. at the expense of all the others. in this country, it's widely believed that a 4 year degree for the most people. unfortunately, that's insane. of the 3 million available jobs today, less than *20%* require a 4 year degree. the rest require training, and a willingness to learn a skill that's actually in-demand. on top of everything else, we have student loans outstanding in excess of $1 trillion dollars. **in short, we're lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back so they can educate themselves for jobs that no longer exist.** that should probably stop.
i haven't received it. but i've got a brand new office. and it would look perfect on my wall, next to the buffalo head. victoria'll set it up.
you flatter me. you also horrify me. i say this because a quick dirty down-the-wormhole of youtube will in fact confirm all that you have said. my days at qvc (or more specifically, my *nights*) set the tenor and tone for what would eventually become my "career." i was fired 3 times in 3 years (*deservedly so)*. i made fun of the products, and all too often, the people who purchased them. i did this not out of any kind of mean spiritedness, but rather a desperate attempt to remain conscious. **what i got away with from 1989-1992, on live television, will one day be a book.** and if there's any justice in this topsy-turvy industry, my former masters in the home shopping business will invite me back to the scene of the crime to sell said memoirs. but i'm not holding my breath.
too many to mention. although i will mention one. there is a farm, in northwest indiana, called "fair oaks." mike and sue run one of the largest dairies in the midwest. we first shot there back in 2006, and mike trusted me to not only deliver a dozen cows on a cold winter's evening, he allowed me to perform a cesarean. after that, he invited the crew and i to stay with them for the evening, and several days afterward. which we did. to this day, none of us are allowed to fly over indiana without first landing in chicago, and driving to fair oaks to drink their wine, and their delicious milk. but mostly, their wine.
i push carts at a wal-mart. if they put mike out there on black friday, we may never see him again.
/r/talesfromretail would give mr. rowe enough horror stories that he'd have to try. /r/talesfromtechsupport is another option, but i wouldn't wish tech support on a cop, and they already deal with what they naively think are the stupidest people possible.
tough call. but the following watering holes beckon. * the horse you came in on * the whistling oyster * john stevens * the mount royal tavern * and anyplace that still serves crab cakes without a bunch of unnecessary filler.
*heh.* favorite dinosaur. personally, and i say this with no disrespect to lizards or reptiles, i try not to get too attached to anything that's been extinct for more than 60 million years. i find it leads to a kind of... malaise. ain't nobody got time for that.
well, i narrated ghosthunters for 8 seasons. all i can tell you for sure regarding the paranormal is that there's good money in it.
yes. doug is back. paler, and more bitter than ever. the once-good-natured director of photography has now become a thoroughly disgruntled albino. who i still respect, and admire. chris jones is also back. he, too, appears older than ever, and profoundly disenchanted with life in general. combined, the 3 of them make for a truly indispensable triumvirate.
i did go to a guidance counselor in high school, his name was mr. dunbar, and he gave me the worst advice i've ever heard. he told me that my desire to attend a 2 year community college was "beneath my potential." as it turns out, the 2 year school i ultimately attended allowed me to experiment, and explore, all kinds of studies that i simply would not have been able to afford at the university. consequently, i got on the road that brought me to where i'm sitting now. although, to be fair, i should point out that the road also led through several miles of sewer pipes.
1) typically, i don't use words like "favorite" to describe dirty jobs. but in general, the best ones are always the ones with the most interesting people. bob the pig farmer. jane the marine biologist. frank the bridge painter. there were 300, and to be honest, they were all pretty great. regarding number 2, the only novels i presently narrate are of the pop-up variety.
i do. i'm a big fan of unexpected juxtapositions - in life as well as on television. to burst forth with a few bars of puccini or verdi while crawling through some nameless river of shit is precisely the kind of thing that creates the cognitive dissonance i strive to infect my friends and viewers with. also, i find that quoting famous literature in equally absurd moments and situations can bring about the same effect.
there will always be plumbing, wiring (electrician) and welding jobs (among many others far too numerous to mention). the tools and techniques may change but humans will always need people to manitain the infrastructure that makes us civilized. if your son is as it minded as you are, there are plenty of related infrastructure jobs there too.
north state rendering is about to get an offer they can't refuse.
wait. the mob likes operations that turn big things into untraceable, unrecognizable chunks? i wonder what the obsession is?
i was the automation controls engineer for a large rendering company in the united states when your episode of dirty jobs came out. i just want to point out that the level of cleaning up nsr did before you got there, to make the job seem less dirty, was amazing. the stuff i've seen and been in, and then seeing nsr, two different worlds. and the company i worked for wasn't even close to mob owned. if you're ever serious about wanting to go do the "somebody's gotta do it" take on rendering, shoot me a pm. i might be able to get you in contact with a company that might be willing.
coast guard represent! never got the opportunity myself to get stationed on a buoy tender, but those crews work hard, party hard definitely.
thanks for responding! i like imagining a female god with a booming baritone voice
bam! mike rowe for president... if you're qualified that is. mike rowe for governor at least.
wow. this has been a trend that has been going on for quite a while, to the point that it single handedly drove me away from cable tv and to youtube for my educational programming. i've always respected your work, and now i respect you even more for making a move like this based on moral and ethical grounds. you're a real cool guy, mr. rowe.
fair oaks farm! absolutely love that place, and stopping there for some killer squeaking cheese curds + ice cream + a visit to the famous birthing station (it's exactly what it sounds like). it makes the road trip from chicago to cinci, louisville, etc... much more enjoyable.
i was hired last year to walmart as a "cart associate" on november 15th. i had to walk miles around to collect our distraught carts. my coworker got hit by two different cars and i was in such a rush that day that my nipples started bleeding. fun times.
i'm guessing that people on /r/thewire generally sided with david simon.
i seem to remember the mythbusters trying to achieve the results of this job with explosives at some point.
thanks for answering this one. i was bummed that dave barsky was not able to follow. you two had such a delightful dynamic.
i've found most guidance counselors want anyone they think is remotely intelligent to be a lawyer, doctor, professor, etc. or at least start on that track. i understand these are high-earning professions but they're just not for everyone. neither is the mountain of student loan debt.
this is the first and last time i will ever say this on reddit. please deliver.
new from burger king, the 'new york classic', with extra frankie the squealer. have it our way! or else.
i was with a bearing manufacturer that makes the largest bearings in the world. it was the same thing there. when "how its made" was doing a segment on us, people were forced to clean the floor and machines with toothbrushes. figuratively speaking, of course. the working conditions were made to look a lot better on tv than they are in reality. i'm sure they do that everywhere, except for japanese factories. they're just always freakishly clean.
might seem naive, but why do you bother cleaning these if they're in the water?
so why is the interior of a buoy open to the outside? seems like a ton of ways to avoid this job having to be done.
that's how they clean some of the rail cars that you see on the tracks that carry chemicals. the outer metal that you see is really only for show. it covers several inches of insulation. the actual tank is buried in there, is much smaller, and has much thicker metal. someone puts on a rubber suit, gets a headlamp, and wiggles horizontally into the tube (this is a job for smaller people), and scrapes the dried chemical off the wall with a razor blade.
is that a euphemism for the job driving them to drink?
you, sir, have a fine writing style that breaks down complex issues into very easy to understand language. the world of expositional writing lost a bright star when you decided to squish poo
baltimore and poop-squisher, eh? you wouldn't happen to be working at back river, would you?
this will never work. mike will create cold fusion but then throw out the details and go jack off a bull.
god played by jeri ryan, voiced by james earl jones?
you know, having actually worked 300 disparate jobs, he's uniquely qualified to be president.
let's not go overboard with the nobility thing. discovery canceled *dirty jobs*. it's not like mike quit doing it because he was offended by the network's other programming. but to his credit, they did offer him some other positions in the "scripted but we'll pretend it's real" category, and he turned that stuff down until he could do a show he felt was reasonably authentic.
i asked this somewhere else in the thread but it got buried, so maybe i'll find some help here: my mother swears up and down that in the early 90's, she caught the best mike rowe moment ever. she had turned on qvc at some stupidly late hour because she couldn't sleep. mike rowe was on-air, obviously displeased with having to sell things to an audience of practically no one. she claims that he walked off-set, and showed back up holding an ice cube with a string tied around it. he then proceeded to try and sell it with a straight face. i've never been able to find a single clip or video that confirms her story, but i want to believe it *so badly*. if anyone can find proof of this, you'll be my internet hero.
holy shit, i was laughing so hard while he was just commenting over the video of the cat. why is qvc never like this when i'm flipping channels?
"well i tell you what, this is some of the most gripping video we've ever had the opportunity to bring you folks at home."
this is the funniest thing i've seen today. good god. mike definitely says "wtf" on live television at 2:18 $36 fucking dollars for a plastic coated paper bag...
oh my god, noah's ark. "you got your... siberian tiger" *muttering off-stage* "or some kind of sheep. that's a sheep. what? no. it's not a cow, it's a sheep."
my dad said that's actually the correct way to do it. he said you chisel out the concrete where you stand then keep going until eye level. then you move back and do the same until the concrete is broken up. then you rotate the drum and repeat. source: 32 years in the concrete business.
to be fair, this is the first response in this thread that i've seen where he blatantly self promoted, and it's pretty danged far down. he certainly hasn't used every (or even many) response for it like a certain mr. rampart rampart rampart rampart rampart rampart did.
ohhhh, that's cold. this is the first *plug* i have seen mike make for his new show, and his answers so far are *incredibly* in depth and well written. imo, this ama is a success in every possible way!
is there a reason they're not wearing more protective gear? i would refuse to do that job without a full hazmat suit.
the "have it our way! or else." part made me laugh pretty historically at work when saying it in a wise-guy voice.
hey, you want i should render your face? i mean...uh....nope. not the mafia. what's a mafia. who are you?
um, i was told too? but all that growth weighs them down more and it can fuck up the paint leading to rust?
whoa, good catch! do you work in the wastewater industry? we actually *make* some really neat sludge presses, help people tune them for exactly what they want to squish, figure out the best way to polymerize and flocculate the effluent, and come back if they have any problems. they're really neat because they're pretty much self-maintaining, which means the operators don't have to do stuff like take apart a giant filter mechanism that's covered in poop to replace it with a fresh one. i think they're probably in favor of that. personally, i'm a generalist. i organize stuff, fix computers (need a website? the server it runs on? the network it talks through? the fiber and cat5 cable that carries the traffic? done, done, done and done.), figure out how to get stuff where it needs to go, and learn how poop squishing works so i can help out with that too.
we can only hope he does the documentation for his poop squishing company.
i fell over in the squatting position and hit my head on a table. back to reddit for me.
we would be way more fucked without plumbers. my uncle always told me i should go into plumbing. his reasoning? "people don't care how much it costs to fix their shitter when it breaks, they want it done right now".
the latter is in fact necessary for effective cold fusion. that's why we haven't gotten it to work yet.
why would you quit a show you believe in because the network has shows you don't? now the network has no shows you believe in and things are worse off all around. change is inspired by example.
i guess you could say the demand was victoriaous. (don't worry i'll show myself out)
your mother speaks the truth. it was april 1st, 1992. i introduced item # j-h20, the ice pendant. it was in fact, an ice cube, dangling from a piece of twine. the most extraordinary fact was not that 12 people actually ordered the damn thing. it was that the people taking the orders at qvc believed the product was genuine. that episode set the stage for my second firing.
...what is he chewing on? ...what is he doing blaire? ...it looks like he's...what is happening?
"2 of each there. you have to have that for.... breeding purposes."
yeah as i was thinking about it and reading other replies i'd bet it also depends highly on the truck itself. like some may have finer controls, or some have limited entry as someone mentioned that might cut your air hose or power cord if rotated.
claustraphobia + hydrophobia + darknessphobia = seriously the worst combo ever with that gig: trapped forever + megaladon at your feet + spooky ghosts.
but i've already seen mike rowe jack off a bull, and yet still no cold fusion. explain that one science!
wait, what happened? associated press november 9, 2016 in a stunning upset, mike rowe was elected the 45th president of the united states, despite not running for office. 46% of registered voters wrote rowe in rather than vote for the candidates from traditional parties. a confused rowe acknowledged his victory in the shortest celebration speech in history. from his living room in his home, he stated that "he was as surprised as everyone." when asked what his platform was, he noted that "well, i've got hardwood floors, and below that, there are some struts, so, wood?"
*oh my god...* i had no idea i'd actually be getting an answer to this. for nearly two decades, i stuck to my guns that this never really happened. that woman has earned some apologies... she'll be ecstatic to hear that her story was validated by the man himself. i really appreciate you taking the time to come back and answer this. even if it means i'm earning myself almost a lifetime's worth of retroactive *"i told ya so"*s after telling my mom.
"all ready mix truck drums have only 2 ways in and out. they all have a man way entry near the front of the cab, and of course where the material is introduced to the drum. in some cases depending on the amount of build up in a drum, you can crawl in the loading hopper and take care of it in a short amount of time. when it's going to take you a day or two or more, you always pull the safety hatch off for better ventilation. in either case, you always take the key to your truck and put it in your pocket, that way nothing happens that you don't want to happen." he also said you don't fully turn the drum when cleaning it out, just 90 degrees at at a time. the info in the quotes are what my dad actually typed. the last is my addition from our conversation.
seriously, that would be awesome. how do we make this happen?
what caused europa to form with so much water? was it brought upon by another body or are these questions yet to be answered?
hi bill. what unanswered question are you desperate to get an answer for?
will we go to another planet in my lifetime? (i'm 24) please say yes.
i recently read a national geographic article talking about the drake equation, and the plausibility of finding habitable planets. how close do you think we are to doing this? will it happen in our lifetime?
reading the title, i'm just curious; is the water on europa fresh or salty, like our oceans?
what do you think would be the public reaction if life was found on europa?
has there been any advancements on protecting humans from radiation damage outside earth's protection?
what are your thoughts on the movie europa report?
thank you very much for doing this ama. have you ever seen the movie 2010 (the squeal to 2001 a space odyssey)? at the end a stern message is given to attempt no landing on europa. all these worlds are yours except europa attempt no landing there use them together use them in peace
are you going to start up a new science show any time soon?
bill: with the breakout success of levar burton's kickstarter campaign to bring reading rainbow back into classrooms and to mobile devices across the country, would you consider launching a similar drive to create new bill nye the science guy content and distribute it to kids (and some 20-something year-old fans) everywhere?
what do you imagine to be the most exciting implication of finding another habitable world in our own solar system?
do you fear at all for the future of space agencies? when i look at the comparison between funding of the military and nasa, it's worrying.
thank you all so much for doing this ama! bill, i'm a huge fan! i always used to watch your show when i was younger and you inspired me to go into a stem field (materials engineering). these questions are for all of you or whomever wants to answer: **how likely is it that we will be able to travel to europa? how far in the future can we expect this to happen?** what do you think is the most interesting thing about science/what never fails to blow your mind? and lastly, if you could change one thing about how the sciences are taught to american children, what would it be? thanks again for coming to answer all these questions :)
who would win in a fist fight between you and neil degrasse tyson?
in what ways could the ice on europa be penetrated if astronauts were to visit, and would there be any potential dangers posed by the ice?
i'm curious to why we haven't sent any probes to europa? sure mars is cool but a habitable moon is cooler.
love ya', bill, but when will someone update disney world's world of energy ride with you and ellen? :-)
to what extent is the plutonium shortage halting a europa trip?
hi, this is a question for ellen. if nasa had 100% of the us's current national budget, what would you want to do with that money?
do you have more faith in europa sustaining life than mars?
mr. nye, what do you think of the state of journalism and media in regards to climate science? what were your worst and best interviews?
hey bill nye, ellen stofan and robert pappalardo! thank you for stopping by reddit and giving us this opportunity - what's something you can tell us that will shock most of us about europa? - what is one big mystery of europa? - do you think that nicolas cage may hold the answers to unlocking this mystery? thank you all for giving us this chance on behalf of this ama i'd like to commend you the contributions you've made to science and wish the best of luck on your current and future projects
does nasa have a protocol they can discuss for if somehow they found "intelligent" life (whether it be in the oceans of europa somehow, beyond life as we know it, or elsewhere)?
how concerned are you all about spreading the earth's microorganisms around the place? and do you think any could reasonably survive in a foreign planet, potentially creating more life over the next few billion years?
hey guys! thank you for inspiring me to go into stem first of all, and second, what do you think our course of action would be should we discover life on europa? also how would we get there/ get beneath the planets icy crust? would you expect these organisms to be produce energy through chemosynthesis like those near hydrothermal vents here in our corner of the solar system?
hey bill and friends, do you believe deep down that there is life living currently on europa? if so how developed would you think it might be (as in bacteria vs. something fish-like)? also how long down the road do you think it is to have a definitive answer as to whether or not there is anything alive there?
bill, what is the best general life advice you would give to someone?
hi mr. nye, dr. stofan and dr. pappalardo! i am a college student and recently took an astrobiology course in which we discussed the possibility of life on europa. do you think that humans could one day colonize europa, or would the distance and temperature make that unfeasible? if the latter proves true, could europa instead be used as a fueling station of sorts for future space travel? also, i wanted to thank you bill for all that you've done to promote science education across the country. you are truly inspiring. thanks for doing this ama!
what do you think about bbc banning creationists from debating the global climate crisis on air?
do you think we will see a mission to explore the (possible) subsurface ocean of europe in your lifetime? thank you!
how does the exploration of europa rank with the colonization of mars?
what, in your opinion, is the most fascinating thing about science?
is there a window of time to get to europa? if we miss this window, how long would we need to wait for another good opportunity?
what advice can you give females that are interested in pursuing a career in science? thanks so much for doing this ama everyone!!
could you guys give us an idea of the kind of life you would expect to find on europa? what's the possibility of coming across some massive sea creature, like a whale?
what do you think the next big technological and motivational achievement that humanity is going to achieve. such as landing on the moon in 1969 changed the world then. what will it take to change the world now?
say we have man land on mars within the next 25 years, which planet would be the next for man to land on?
hi bill, huge fan of yours. with all of these reports of near earth flybys of large asteroids, do you think we are close to a doomsday asteroid hitting our earth? if you think it would be soon,how could we combat this issue? thank you!
bn: was there, or better yet, is there life on other worlds? that's why i took this job as ceo of the planetary society. mars may still harbor something alive today, and who knows what's in the sea of europa!
yes!! we have a plan to send humans to mars in the 2030's- and with work- we can make it happen. --ellen
with the james webb space telescope, we will look at the atmospheres of planets around other stars- taking a big leap towards finding habitable planets! jwst launches in 2018- so stay tuned! -- ellen
we are searching for life on mars and hopefully soon on europa- we are following the liquid water, which scientists think is critical for life. i think the public would be in awe over the ability to answer the question- are we alone, how similar is life on other worlds to life here on earth, and how can we use that information to better understand ourselves! --- ellen
at nasa, we are working hard on this issue- because it is critical to our ability to get astronauts to mars in the 2030's. the mars curiosity rover has an instrument that characterized the radiation environment between earth and mars and on the surface, giving us specific numbers to work with. -- ellen
it was fun! it stretched the science a bit, but that's okay for the movies. it raised awareness of europa, its science, and the drive to explore it! -robert p.
back in 1995 there was a scientific conference on the possibility of an ocean beneath europa's ice shell. arthur c. clark tied in via a video connection from his home in sri lanka, which was a big feat for the day. he gave us express verbal permission to send a lander to europa! :-) -robert p.
bn here: oh, we are working hard on that. sorting several offers. meanwhile, my book undeniable, the science of creation comes out in november. buy a carton or two ;-)
it would tell us that life could be very common throughout the universe. and we would be able to examine another life chemistry: would it be the same or different from that on earth? these would be huge advances scientifically and to humanity as a whole! -robert p.
we're in an interesting position in our civilization where, technologically, there is nothing stopping us from exploring most of the solar system robotically. the big limiting factor is funding. but nasa is exploring some really exciting concepts right now, including a mission called the clipper that would orbit jupiter and fly by the moon something like 45 times to perform initial reconnaissance. most mission concepts could get there by the early to mid-2020s. if you're talking about humans, a la **europa report** that's a lot different. the big factor there is radiation protection for astronauts, which is a problem pretty much any time you leave low-earth orbit. --casey
the most astonishing thing about science is that it is a process that lets us humble humans know so much (or what seems like so much) about the universe. we are part of the cosmos, yet we can understand it. amazing. for science education: i say we need to emphasize and fund in elementary schools. that's not where we should cut back. people get their lifelong passion of science before they're ten years old. and, that lead to discovery and innovation. bn
david grinspoon's book: lonely planets. -robert p.
neil would crush me. but based on our day of bike riding, i'm pretty sure i can outrun him. phew... bn
my brief advice is to follow your dreams and desires. along the way, i was told that there are very few jobs studying the planets at nasa. but if you are dedicated and persistent, one of those could be yours. who would have thought i would be leading the effort to study the science for a mission to europa? -robert p.
great to read from you! the key to teaching anything (i think) is to let your passion show. let em' see you love them and that you care how well they do along with the joy of science. for a pic, check out my new site (your home page) billnye.com
write to 'em. it was big fun... people like it perhaps because its air conditioned;-) bn
love it. that's weird al himself newtonising... and they're imitating me. i mean that's as immitationally flattering as it gets. i admit though, i'm not sure why i would be battling isaac newton rather than sitting down to share an apple and some peanut butter. bn
mars is hard to land on and even harder to live on. i say, if you want to live on mars, try antarctica for a few years, and to make it realistic, bring your own air. don't know what europan life would be like; that's why we want to send a mission. how cool would it be to find something living way out there! billnye.com
nasa has a very strong budget to explore our solar system and the universe, utilize the iss and develop the capabilities to prepare to send humans beyond low earth orbit, and do research in aeronautics to make air travel safer and more efficient. so if we had more money- i would keep doing what we are doing- just more of it :-) ---ellen
i would doubt it *[could support human life]. jupiter has a nasty radioactive belt that encompases most of the moons. your face would probably melt if you went there. (i am being dramatic of course, but yea it would be pretty bad.) *edit
we're near the tipping point. most people will stop denying it soon. then, we have to find ways to make up and be friendly. man oh man, it's going to be a near run thing, though. humans will live through the big changes in the next century, but it's not clear how many and how well. phew. bn
i understand why you might hope that mr. cage could help us out, but he is playing a character named ben gates. gates: that's the guy you need, but i don't think he's available, as he is fictional and all. bn
the breakthrough we need is a better battery, a better system to store energy, electricticy especially. such a development would, dare i say it, change the world!
oh my friend, glad you're into sci, eng, tech, and math. the big news is that we do **not** have to drill through the ice on europa to sample its seawater. we can fly a spacecraft through the geyser plumes! it will make the cost of the mission wonderfully affordable. that's why the planetary society joined with nasa in washington today. bn
two things: - every person is responsible for his or her own actions. - work to leave the world better than you found it... bn
i am not bill nye obviously but have you considered starting a youtube channel about your interests ? many sciences lovers do that and a lot of them are really good. :)
it may even be a woman! :-) other than our moon, the other most feasible places to send humans would be asteroids. -robert p.
at first i was like "what? life on europa, of course there is!" then i remebered it's a moon and not europe, which is pronounced europa in norway.
i would rather see trillions going into space research/exploration than into global domination any day!
after 3 years of lurking i created an account just so i could upvote this
on a scale of 1 to 10, how likely do you think it would be to find mermaids on europa? 8? 9?
it's really just a question of how much shielding weight would need to be lifted into orbit, right?
what can people really do on mars that a robotic mission can't? what is the additional cost we are paying to have a human vs a human controlled robot? could we have ten missions? are we expecting the publicity to be so great that it will spark a public desire for even greater space funding? seems like we're taking a risk by spending 10x to do the science as a sort of marketing push to incentivize science funding.
have you considered funding a new show via kickstarter? it did wonders for levar burton's effort to reboot reading rainbow.
they definitely need to pull a reading rainbow and crowdfund another bntsg, i can't even imagine how quickly it would reach it's funding goal.
he was talking about a new show. the old show was produced by disney, and i don't think it's likely that they would release the rights.
do you think we could travel to these habitable planets within the next few lifespans? how long would it take to terraform them, approximately?
i wonder what the funding comparisons are between the real europa project and the europa report movie..
i feel like *human* exploration is holding back robotic exploration. i'd rather do the science than try to mimic star trek. how would you feel about redirecting the mars human landing to more robotic missions to more planets? we can do so much more with robots.
is radiation protection still a major issue that far out from the sun? or are there even more radiation issues to worry about (some sort of jovian analogue to the van allen belts)?
thank you so much for this comment bill. i teach 4th-5th grade mathsci. there is a real lack of quality material available for this age group. most resources are "dumbed down" to the point of superficial information, and too much of the so called experiments are little more than "gee whiz" demos. this age group is capable of so much more real science when given the chance. how do i know? my students regularly design and carry out their own investigations. professional development and curriculum development is needed. teachers need to experience doing math and science and deepen their understanding. increase opportunities for elementary students, too many eligibility cutoffs at middle school for things like getting experiments into space for example.
this is beautiful. this is exactly what i'd love to do! planetary research is becoming more and more desirable, i suppose! do you have any specific tips? thanks!
if history books taught me one thing then it's that isaac newton would rather fight, though.
that's funny, because "weird al" has a reddit ama today too. (sorry for my bad english)
so who in the government is forcing you to say you have a strong budget? because i'm pretty sure nasa never has a strong enough budget. these are the space people we're talking about. we need to give the space people more money.
is this because of the lack of atmosphere / magnetosphere, or is there some other reason radiation is more intense at that place in space?
maybe moohoodles is an astrobiologist who currently presents as male, but is considering transitioning genders?
it's all the way in the gamma ray spectrum so only atomic nuclei will absorb it. no amount of chemistry or engineering is going to help. it's a risk/benefit problem. it's one area where asteroid mining could be beneficial. you don't really need processed material to create a shield against cosmic rays. just lots of anything.
99% certain that a new bnsg show kickstarter would out fund the rr kickstarter by a factor of at least 2 or 3.
tip: pay attention in your science and math classes! :-) -rp
some redditors may disagree but there is a difference between being theist and stupid.
now all we need to do is send will smith and a camera crew.
marine corps pilots typically were the ones who went on to become astronauts. source: my grandfather was 2 inches too tall to be an astronaut or else he would have been on the moon with neil armstrong.
how polite of you, you might give him/her the wrong idea about the reddit community. lol
i am very ignorant when it comes to the concept of radiation. i know it's bad and it gets absorbed by some materials, but even those materials have a limit on how much they can absorb before they become an issue themselves. this may even be a misconception i have. is there anything that can be done in the way of repelling radiation before it hits the surface of an object or perhaps making the object radiation "phobic" like hydrophobic materials are with water?
just because they're life-habitable doesn't make them human habitable. (life can exist at extreme pressures at thermal vents at the bottom of earth's oceans, while a human would implode there) if life exists on europa for instance, it might be in the oceans under a very thick layer of ice. europa doesn't have an atmosphere, and humans need breathable air. (that being said, i doubt we could terraform europa to have a breathable atmosphere, i don't think it has the gravity to hold onto one)
as the first australian to see this, i'm obligated to say sorry on behalf of our country for the whole ken ham existing thing.
better yet, jaden smith. how can mars be real if robots aren't real
not to shatter your childhood memories of grandpa but that sounds like one of those stories gramps will tell his grand kids and kids because it's exciting and not because it's true.
the earth uses its magnetic field to repel radiation. maybe if we figure out some better materials science we could use a magnetic field in conjunction with physical shielding to lighten the load.
to be fair, he's making bill-ions all the time, or at least some of the enzymes in his body are. mostly hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, sodium ions and the like.
most amazing thought ever: neil degrasse tyson as the deep-voice-over guy on bill nye show.... "sure bill... uh-huh"
of course, terraforming a planet which already sustains non-human life might not be the greatest thing with regards to the local ecosystem...
if robots could speak they would be the most intelligent beings on planet mars.
there are different kinds of radiation, and some, like gamma, are not affected by magnetic fields.
don't worry, we're going to clone him as soon as we have the technology.
nasa actually takes steps to ensure that, if probes or people end up on other planets or moons, no bacteria will follow and out-compete possible local life. we already prevent terraforming in one sense, then.
it's important to note that they do this to the best of their ability, but that doesn't mean that it's perfect by any means.
1. what is next for new horizons? 2. what do we hope to learn about pluto? 3. what other information/pictures/data will new horizons be sending back? 4. what has your day been like and what does it feel like to be part of the team? thank you so much for all your work. the significance of this is not lost on us, though i am still working at fathoming all of it.
what programming languages are used in the software onboard?
i was born after the voyager missions, and even though i was aware of other missions (to saturn, to mars), this is the first one to give me a tremendous sense of awe about how big the solar system is and about our ability to explore it. so thanks! :) my question is this: my first daughter is being born in september, and i'm wondering what you think the first mission will be that will give her the same sense of wonder? what's coming down the pipe in the next 15-20 years or so?
in the magic school bus episode *lost in the solar system*, arnold removes his helmet on pluto during an argument and his head is instantly frozen in a block of ice. although this is obviously not what would happen, does any water ice exist on pluto? has the probe discovered more or less water than expected, or any water at all?
what are the first pictures we will see from new horizons after the "phone home"?
congratulations! =) * will information be gathered/transmitted once past pluto, or does the mission end here? * how do your findings compare to the team's original expectations? * what is the most unexpected thing you have discovered so far since the "flyby" began? thank you!!
hello new horizons team! i wanted to ask if there was any chance of turning the new horizons camera back towards earth to see if we can pull another "pale blue dot?"
does new horizons have the capability to find any undiscovered moons? also, my little girl has been fascinated with space since she was two. she ran in my office this morning "daddy, can you show me pictures of pluto today?" i loved having that moment where i could say "we've never seen it this close before ever" and watch a kid's curiosity get sparked by it. thank you!
hi nasa, first i would like to congratulate on great job that you've done! question: what is the most exciting thing that you have discovered during this expedition new horizons?
hello new horizons team! i just want to say congratulations on the success of the mission and also a heartfelt thank you. i can remember being a little kid watching shows like bill nye the science guy and the magic school bus featuring the solar system and how little we knew about pluto. pluto was my favorite planet growing up. i can remember the day it was "demoted" to dwarf planet and how disappointed i felt (now i'm an avid defender of its dwarf status). how does it feel to finally see pluto? what emotions bubbled up when you saw the first picture that you could actually make out what she looked like? also, if you have time. what scientific knowledge do you think we can gain from this? about pluto, but also about our solar system and other planetary systems?
congratulations new horizons team on today's flyby! i know we won't get any new signals from the spacecraft until tonight, but based on all the pre-flyby data and images, what are the 3 things you are most excited to get more information about?
will we see detailed photos of pluto's moons in near future too?
how has this mission made you feel in terms of "your place in the universe"? i realise this is an esoteric question but i wonder if you are experiencing the overwhelming fact that "the more you learn, the less you know". science and space must be saturating your thoughts - and rightly so - but how has this incredible mission impacted on you as part of humankind?
at 2015-07-15 19:00 utc, new horizon is shown spinning around scanning all of the sky with alice. which looks hilarious at high speed. what science is being done there?
so excited for this! my question is does pluto have an atmosphere? and if so, what kinds of things can you determine about it?
how does data get sent back to earth from new horizons? how long does it take for a photo to be received?
hello, will we be seeing photos of the elusive kerberos and styx?
congratulations new horizons team! how old were you when the mission started? how old will yo be when last mission finish? also, all the code of the ship is programed in some common language (c, c++)?
i have been looking forward to this day for years - it's my birthday, too, so thanks nasa, for an awesome present! it's so exciting to be able to witness scientific history. i have one question: will new horizons be gathering any more data past the pluto flyby, or will it just be focusing on transmitting the data it has already gathered? thanks for doing this ama!!
what were your predictions for the flyby back when new horizons first launched in 2006? how are your findings different now?
congratulations on one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. my question is how did you figure out the diameter of pluto, did you use just trigonometry or something else?
now that we have better pictures of pluto, where would you say the best location for a penguin sanctuary would be?
ok, super early to ask this, but: does the team have any idea of what the next kuiper belt target might be, and how many more years it'll take to get there?
hello! thank you so much for doing this and all your awesome work. a couple of questions. first, when did we know for sure that pluto was copper colored? also, what's next realistically for new horizons? thanks! go new horizons!!!
congratulations on reaching pluto! my question would be about hearth shape of pluto. do we have at least a theory on how it formed, and what is it made up from?
hey guys! congratulations! how's the atmosphere over there now? what's the next thing on your checklist?
how much more expensive would it have been to send the probe into orbit around pluto instead of a fly-by?
how does the new horizons probe stay warm? from reading specs, the probe is designed a bit like a thermos bottle to stay insulated and operate at room temperature, but what's the original heat source? is it the same plutonium radiation that is used to power the probe? thank you!
how powerful is the computer inside the spacecraft?
what's the lorri exposure time for the pictures taken in charonshine?
when i was in grade one, we were doing a "space" unit in class. it was my favourite. my teacher had posted real pics of all of the planets, up on the blackboard - except for pluto, little pluto was a drawing of a small blue sphere. i asked my teacher why pluto didn't have a pic; she said it was much too far away, too small and anything we launched there would take a lifetime to arrive, so i'd never see it. i want to thank you guys - the whole team - for proving her wrong, and satisfying a six year old's curiousity, even if it took twenty years to do so! and because i have to ask a question i'd like to know, are we going to get clear pics of the other moons besides charon? have you had any indication pluto might have other undiscovered satellites?
what an amazing day! i got my new startalk t-shirt in the mail and got to watch the live broadcast this morning! how long will new horizons transmit data back to nasa? can we potentially use it for additional research beyond pluto?
hello nasa, how far the new horizon is anticipated to travel ?
what data are your teams looking forward to the most to receiving?
since new horizons launched 9 years ago, was there a lot of turnover in the team from that point to now?
are there any plans to use lorri to peer back into the solar system (pointing back at the sun) near the end of life of the mission?
in what format does the new horizon send images? does it look more like a zip archive and is sent with other data, or do the files go separately? are the images sent in jpeg or some other compressed format or are you getting raw data?
what are the technical specifications of new horizons' storage system? how much data can it hold, and how many images (and other data) does that represent?
how accurate are the numbers from the nasa eyes visualization app? (i am absolutely loving the app by the way!)
will new horizons ever "pass" voyager 1 in terms of leaving the solar system? or will new horizons slow down?
were there any close calls, or averted disasters?
my 10 year old loves to read about this and wants to (so far) work in this field as an adult. what are your degrees in? and after all the data is in, what is next for your group?
is there any communication with nh that involves 2-way communication (command send/received) or is the entire flight pre-orchestrated? (just thinking, 11hrs is some serious lag!)
is there an inside reference to the honeymooners that caused the parts to be named ralph and alice?
are we going to see the whale tail on the super closeup photos?
what a great question! i remember holding my newborn son as the first cassini radar data of titan was downlinked in the middle of the night. the next big mission that can "grow up" with your daughter is the europa mission. this mission will investigate if europa and its huge global ocean is habitable. take her to the launch in the early 2020's when she is ~8 years old, then watch the data come in with her when she is a young teenager. - curt
it's hard to make direct comparisons because the way the public can interact with the missions is so different now. does live coverage of an event on national tv in the 1960's equate with websites and twitter feeds updating minute by minute? what i really love about our planetary science missions is that the public can ride along with us, and we want you to join us. these missions are your missions. - curt
some of us re-watched that episode earlier this month! we haven't seen any water on pluto yet, but if there is any water, we'll see it when we get our leisa scans. we've known about the water on charon since the late 80s. -az
the first image we should see after the "phone home" comes several hours later, what we call "c_lorri_fullframe." this will be very much like the image released this morning of pluto, but it will be of the largest moon, charon. --sjr
there are two likely reasons, but forthcoming new horizons' data will hopefully let us refine these or figure out a better reason. one is that pluto is larger than charon, so it can retain more heat and have active geology longer. another is that pluto has a tenuous atmosphere, and during the 248-year orbit around the sun, the atmosphere sublimates from one area in sun and is deposited in another in darkness, and then this reverses half-way through the orbit. this process is very slow, relatively speaking, but so is cratering. --sjr
unfortunately, the lorri camera is extremely sensitive, and looking back towards earth would have the sun in the field of view and blow the instrument out. voyager was able to do this because the instruments were on a platform that could move, and the engineers could orient it such that voyager's dish acted as a sunshield. --sjr
this is a hard question to answer because it changes every couple of hours. you can't pick your favorite christmas present until you are done opening the presents, and we won't be done with that until all the data is downlinked in 16 months. longest. christmas. ever. - curt
three? i'm most excited to see up-close images of "the whale" and "the heart", as well as leisa spectra of those images to see what they are made of. i'm looking forward to images of hydra. with pluto and charon, we've gotten increasingly clearer images that have teased us. hydra has been nothing more than a pixel or two, barely resolved. what it is like will be a complete surprise to us, though we have some suspicion. ditto with the other small satellites. i'm also looking forward to seeing the stereo mosaic we are doing of pluto's surface, which will help us determine elevation. -az
this observation is sky_lymap! we are basically somersaulting 6 times, hence the awesome animation. - jillian
for #3: it was hard. we have a great navigation team who worked tirelessly to make this work. we had a wonderful launch, a recent tcm that got us on track, and we are very happy. for #4:we had an issue over the july 4th weekend. many engineers and scientists worked over the holiday weekend to recover from the fault. --jillian
not only do they send a machine 2.9 billion miles away, they have it report back all the data it's gathered as well. meanwhile, i still can't get wifi in my bathroom.
pluto does have an atmosphere! it is bit on the thin side, 10 microbars compared to earth's 1 bar. it is ~98% n2, with trace ch4 and co. we will be looking at its structure, and its composition - all sorts of good info will come from both the visual images from the lorri images, and the alice instrument. ~kelsi
the light-travel time is about 4.5 hours at this distance. it takes over an hour for an image to be played back because of the very slow speeds over such a long distance. --sjr
we are getting data tomorrow! july 15th! that is higher resolution than anything we have ever gotten so far (~400 m/px and right now we have 4 km/px). we will get even higher the data takes a while to come back, so we probably won't get that back until ~mid-sept. ~kelsi
no, they were discovered too late. we will be observing them briefly but they will be close to point-like objects and we won't get that data for several months. --sjr
i was 24 when i started on new horizons in 2004. i will be ..hmm... older when it finishes. at least in my 50/60s when the power runs out.--jillian
many observations are being taken during and around the closest approach to the planet and its moons. this includes observations of the night side as well as what we call "sliver" maps which are the very thin crescent images that the craft will see over the coming weeks. sliver observations are planned through july 30. --sjr
well, there is some trig, yes. we actually fit profiles to the limb of pluto. which is a fancy way of saying that we trace around the edge of pluto, which provides us something close to a circle, and then measure how many pixels across that circle is. since we know how many km per pixel, we can figure out the diameter in km by counting those pixels. it sounds straightforward, but the artistry comes in figuring out when you "stop" counting pixels (where the edge is) --curt
thanks! you ask a great question that has one of the very favorite answers that scientists like to give: we don't know! you have no idea how excited scientists get when our answer is "i don't know." it ranks up there with the cogent observation "well, that's weird..." so no, we don't have any idea how that formed - yet! - curt
it would not be possible with current technology due to needing so much fuel at launch. --sjr
the computer is a whopping 12 mhz. yes, you read that correctly: 12 megahertz. people are always surprised at how much less powerful our flight computers are compared to their home computers. but we build them rugged. if you bolted your laptop atop a rocket, violently shook it, exposed it to vacuum, and had it endure temperature extremes and radiation, then your vacation pictures might be at risk. but ours will be just fine. - curt
why does the dark pole surprise us? is there something scientifically unusual about it, or were we expecting it to match something else in the solar system?
c_lorri_fullframe.jpg? .img? you upload the pictures in full resolution? or using some compress technique?
yes, we tried to get it as close to real color as possible :). we combine the wavelengths that we have and translate it into what the human eye would see. ~kelsi
248 year orbit? man, it's a good thing we don't live on pluto. measuring age would be really hard... "grandpa died at the ripe old age of .3 years"
is the sun really that powerful even as far out as pluto? what would a "day" look like on pluto in terms of brightness? if you could turn the lorri camera back and look at the sun and earth, how big would they look (assuming you could block/limit the sun's brightness)? this is all so cool. thank you guys!
this answer made me fear that i was born too early.. thanks for that :/
i order a pizza and they tell me 45 minutes and show up at 50 minutes. these guys shoot a rocket at pluto and get there over a minute early. outrageous.
regarding the fault, how did the team feel when it was discovered the probe entered safe mode? what did you do to recover from the fault? did you try turning it on and off again?
i know you probably can't go into detail much about #4, but what was the fault and how serious was it? i'm curious what goes into fixing an issue when it's on its that far away. it must've been scary having a project 9 years in the making have issues that close to go-time.
if someone was streaming netflix on new horizons, it'd be a different story....
sun to earth: 8 light minutes pluto to earth: 270 light minutes. we really cannot overhype how amazing an achievement this mission has been.
if you bundle in a phone plan, can you get faster d/l speeds?
how long does it take to transfer 1 km/px back to earth?
amazing. do you know how much, if any, data from the kuiper belt will be gathered?
fascinating, but that also sounds like it is very open to interpretation, or am i just misunderstanding the process? thank you for answering my question.
what about ion propulsion? that's how dawn had enough dv to enter the orbits of 2 dwarf planets.
we expected charon's surface to be mostly uniform and featureless. -az
all images now coming down are lossy compressed and are part of the "browse" dataset to better plan what we want to bring down first as uncompressed. --sjr
it's a legal thing... the laws of physics have made it very difficult for isp's to build new networks in the kuiper belt.
kinda cool to think that the pyramids were built ~18.5 pluto years ago.
write, call, or email your representatives in washington and ask them to fund it.
i sincerely hope you are still alive in 16 months.
i think most people think of snow being part of our water cycle--water exists primarily as a liquid on the surface, evaporates, freezes and falls, and then melts again. it would be amazing if pluto had a "methane cycle" or "nitrogen cycle" like that.
i found my own answer: "so, do the math. 2.5 megabits, at 1 kilobit per second: it takes 42 minutes to return one lorri photo to earth. most communications sessions last about eight hours. that's eleven images per communications session. and that assumes that new horizons is transmitting only lorri data, which it's not; there are other science instruments and spacecraft housekeeping data, too. the deep space network has only three 70-meter dishes, and there is a lot of competition for time on them; new horizons is lucky to get one communications session per day. and while new horizons is pointing its dish at earth, it can't point at anything else, including pluto. it has to choose between communicating and taking data."
the plasma and dust instruments will continue to gather data so long as they work and the mission is funded. they don't need to be near a planet to do interesting science. a mission to another kuiper belt object is being proposed to nasa as an extended mission of new horizons. --sjr
you're right, it is somewhat open to interpretation. that's why we have about 5 people do it independently of one another and compare results. and by "compare results" i mean we lock them in a cage together until a victor emerges. and we did that every day for 5 days. - curt
it's funny, because pluto was not declared a dwarf planet due to size. instead, it's because it hasn't "cleared its orbit of similarly sized objects". ceres in the asteroid belt also falls under this category.
mom hang up the phone! i'm trying to download pluto
how much trouble would you be in if you pulled a prank by releasing a photo that wasnt actually pluto?
barely legal pyramids in your area want to meet you
distant third: the lead position in google[x] is called "captain of moonshots." the guy's name is "astro teller," too.
i got like four bucks in my pocket, how far will that get us?
a tiny, like one-pixel blue dot would be about the best view we could get from that distance. doesn't take a lot of imagination...
i'm wondering. would it speed things up if we put deep space relays nodes in throughout the solar system? have the next probe drop a few off around the belt, btwn the jovian and saturnian systems and maybe, if we have another one going out far enough, out to the neptune system. obviously, the speed of light is the limit, but could we not 'boost the signal' using the relays?
part of me knows this isn't real, but most of me believes regardless and is hoping desperately.
well, the direct impetus for the reclassification was the discovery of eris, which ~~is~~ was thought to be larger than pluto.
light does *not* travel the same speed in fiber optics, but rather typically ~30% slower.
they say it's pluto, but it's really omicron persei 8
"dammit, why is the google camera sepia filter on default again!?"
that fucking line in mass effect 2. "what are you so pissed about, why haven't we gone after the reapers? one of them *almost killed you.*" "ah yes, we have dismissed that claim." "...fucking *what?!*"
and it initiates the first contact war with the turians.
but think of all the cute asaris that we get to fuck!
actually in the citadel dlc it is confirmed that the council agrees with you, that the reapers are a real threat. they just can't openly agree or else it would cause a mass panic from the civilians that are always listening to what they say.
yeah let's just say i let sovereign kill them on the next playthrough. take that, dumbasses!
i just want to get the war over with so i can start romancing a battle-scarred ex-cop turian.
that exoskeleton looks really sleek. how much does the whole thing weigh?
what is the best and worst part of your day that might come as a surprise?
how heavily involved in bmx were you at the time of your injury?
what was the biggest moment in recovery from the time you were injured until now?
c5 complete here! if you don't mind me asking, what level are you? i'd be cool if i could try something like that!
i know this question is very vague, but how do you go about your daily life? things like school, using the restroom, hanging out with friends, etc...
do you feel physically comfortable? i mean, i understand that you'd feel numb but is that something you have been able to adjust to and become familiar with?
hello! i'm a software engineer at a large tech company (whose products you likely use every day) who works on accessibility. what is the biggest annoyance you run into using software and the web on a daily basis? what can we do to make things better?
i'm not 100% sure what quadriplegic means but how do you type? also do you still miss bmx and what do you do now instead?
how has your relationships been with people before and after the accident? did people just stop hanging out with you because of the accident?
what is your inspiration when you're feeling down? what keeps you going so infectiously positive ? - love from holland
how long after your accident did you come to terms with your situation?
what are your dreams like? are you injured or paralyzed in your dreams, or do you have full mobility? thank you for sharing :)
i'm an rn that works with new quadriplegics in the icu right after their injury. i try my very best to be empathetic and professional but i never feel like i'm doing/saying the right thing. what's your advice for health care workers? what's he worst and best thing that happened to you in the hospital?
can i cook for you and your family/friends? i live in richmond and cook for a living and would love the opportunity to do that for you. please get back at me if you find an interest in that.
this may sound dumb, but where do you see yourself in 10-25 years? do you think technology will make your quality of life significantly better? what type of things do *you* see yourself wanting to do? thanks in advance!!
firstly, you're inspirational as shit. now, questions! 1. given that you injured yourself in a bmx accident i take it you were active before - has that made being a quadriplegic particularly hard? 2. what does the future look like? with physio how much improvement can you expect? 3. have your hobbies/general interests changed post-accident? 4. how do you stay so positive? it's such an amazing outlook to have on life. apologies if you've already answered any of these, i'm about read now!
can you still feel your penis? and can you ejaculate? if not what do you do in your free time?
what exactly does your physical therapy consist of? is your therapist just there to make sure you don't fall or is she actively teaching you how to use that cool ass exoskeleton?
did you lose touch with close friends after the accident? what new hobbies did you pick up after the accident?
what is it like walking in the exoskeleton?does it feel like it's holding up your body weight well or not?
how's the dating life going? i mean you're iron man so i imagine you're just killing it out there. also wishing you the best on pt and recovery!
hey man! im in a chair too, and i was wondering when these exo suits become the norm and we both have one, you wanna duke it out in a cyborg battle? we can like stream it and dress up like daredevil and punisher or something sweet like that.
have you ever considered a stem cell transplant to regenerate some feeling in your body?
assuming you can use the exoskeleton, would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?
guess i'll ask here instead. how is your stomach muscles? (where is the injury/complete or incomplete?) doesn't seem to be much stability from the waist up on that suit. i've tried the ekso bionic suit, and there you have like a backpack strap in addition to what you have in this pic. maybe making it very different to operate? anyway, really cool to see someone else in almost the same situation as me!
how can i help you and other quadriplegics? i used to ride my bmx when i was a kid and i fell plenty of times. through sheer luck i never got hurt. life isn't fair. i want to know how can make your life better.
how many times have people asked you if you can jerk off?
where do you find the motivation to continue pushing? i guess i am asking how you rose out of what i anticipate was a dark depression when you became quadriplegic. i don't know if i could find the strength within myself.
based on your previous post, i find you to be incredibly positive, and it inspires me. what is your main philosophy or outlook of life that has kept you this way? and on days when you feel all is wrong in the world/your life, how to you move forward? i know these are general questions that can be asked to anyone, but i'm especially interested in your response. thanks a ton, and keep being you!!
years ago the inventor of the segway invented a wheelchair that could climb steps and curbs. i have never seen it being used by a paraplegic or quadriplegic person. my partial quadriplegic friend explained it is severely hampered by the sense of balance it requires it's users. given you use the suit with a walker or your physical therapist holding you, do you see this as truly beneficial to disabled individuals, or an interesting proof of concept where there needs to be more work?
what music do you listen? also, you have more courage and streght than me, i wish you to have a wonderful life!
have you ever had experience with psychedelics? my sister is good friends with someone who is paralyzed from the waist down, but they are also in constant pain. they use substances like lsd, psilocybin mushrooms and dmt to escape reality and help them to appreciate life more. it's not something i'm suggesting because psychedelics definitely aren't for everyone, but have you ever thought about trying them out/have you ever tried them?
hey mate, seeing as you watch a lot of tv what's your favourite show/movie to watch?
hey buddy! i got a mutual friend that is actually in the same situation as you right now. tell me, how do we realize he might need help with something, and what can we do to make his life more comfortable?
think the washington capitals can win it all this year?
i must say, i am truly amazed at your positive attitude and sense of humor. as a person who deals with depression and negativity every day (and yet probably has vastly more minor problems to deal with than yourself), i'm wondering, how do you manage to stay so positive? you are an incredible inspiration, my cyborg friend.
the best part of waking up is folgers in your cup. (i don't actually drink coffee). the worst part is not being independent. i need help with everything. with eating. getting things. not being able to go to the bathroom on my own.
pretty involved. it's all i did. i worked at a bike shop. i rode my bike every day with friends. went on trips constantly to skate parks or just looking for places to ride
i've had a couple. when i was first injured i had actually no use of any my limbs. i was also on a ventilator. so i couldn't eat or speak. when i was finally taken off the ventilator and could eat again that was a pretty big moment. then i slowly regain use of my left arm. then seven months later came my right arm. and then three years ago i started regaining use of some of my left wrist
i'm c4-c5 complete. if you get the opportunity to use one definitely do it
i just applied to go to vcu so we'll see how that goes as far as restroom, to go pee i have what's called a supra pubic catheter. it's a catheter that comes out of my abs that drains into a leg bag hooked up on my ankle that i have to have someone drain to go poop i sit in a chair with a hole in it then someone shoves a suppository up my ass that makes me go. then if all the poop doesn't come out someone has to reach in with their finger, which is called digital stim, and scoop the rest out. then we roll the chair into the shower and someone bathes me. i do this every other day in the morning. hanging out with friends is just like it used to be except i'm always sitting down
i guess so. i forget a lot of times that i can't feel so sometimes i'll hit my foot and instinctively yell ouch then remember that i can't feel it. i get surprised by my farts a lot too. since i can't tell when i have to fart they just happen. i then look around and see who did that and i'm like oh yeah that's me
i'll have to think about this and get back to you. i want to make sure i give you the best answer i can. i'm terrible at thinking of the spot right now that with all these questions
what a productive question. good job taking advantage of this ama (in a good way, i know that sounded pretty sarcastic lol)
create a new captcha, its a pain in the ass click storefront images without a mouse.
i use a combination of both voice recognition and typing with my knuckles one letter at a time since i have no use of my fingers. if i'm on my phone though, i have it velcroed to my armrest and i use my thumb to type and navigate.
yeah some people have disappeared but some of my relationships and friendships have grown to a new level that i never thought possible. i've had some friends do more than what's asked of them. i can truly say that i love them with all my heart.
when i'm feeling down i try to remind myself that i'm still alive. i may not be able to do what i used to but i still have a lot of potential. i also have the ability to choose which something that can never be taken away from me. i also have the greatest friends and family the anyone could ask for. they're always there when i need them. i try to stay positive and laugh at myself because if i don't the injury wins
my dreams are still the same. depending on the dream i can be paralyzed or not. mostly i'm walking in my dreams. it's really weird because i think to myself oh this is so easy why the hell am i still sitting down.
holy shit i would love to turn your food into poop! thank you! i will pm you in a little bit or you can pm me. whichever
i don't know where i'll be in the future but i do hope i'm walking. i do think technology who do something amazing. some things that i would love to do would be something space related. i love science in space. maybe working at a telescope or something? i also like to give standup comedy try. i'm also trying to learn voice acting so i'd like to see if that whould get me anywhere
i get out of bed. which i need assistance with. someone dresses me and puts me in my chair. that i either listen to music or watch tv. trying to read stuff. a lot of times i get sucked into the dark hole of reddit. then i go to bed which i also need assistance with. then repeat
1. it's made it very hard. 2. no idea what the future looks like but i'm hopeful for the future with technology 3. well besides bmx i also love playing guitar so that's another thing i can't do. but now i have a huge fascination with space. i'm trying to give voice acting a go. and i watch a lot of tv and movies 4. i just try and laugh at everything as much as possible
sadly no. i haven't had an orgasm since i could walk. honestly i don't know if i can ejaculate. i watch a lot of tv in my free time
therapy consist a lot of strengthening what i do have and also maintaining what i don't. ordinarily i do physical therapy in baltimore at kennedy krieger institute but i'm doing it now in richmond as a test run in case i get into vcu. the exoskeleton is good because it's good for my bones by weight bearing. i also use a fes bike for my legs. i attach electrodes to my muscles and it fires as i ride the bike. this helps keep my legs from atrophying and it is good for cardio
yeah. some friendships were based solely on bmx and sometimes people just grew apart regardless still trying to find new hobbies, any recommendations?
it's hard to explain but it's awesome i can't help but smile when i'm using it. it's so strange seeing my feet move below me and not being able to feel it. i forget how tall i actually am. it holds me up pretty well but i still need three people around me at all times. one person behind me to hold my hips. someone in front to guide the walker. and someone to my side to hold my chest in case i lean too far forward
it's meh. the last girl i dated said the chair was too hard for her. but i can't be mad at her because she was honest and upfront with me and to be honest it is pretty hard. luckily i have some awesome friends that really make me feel loved
i would love to but it's still in early phases in the us
one horse sized duck. then find a way to domesticate it and then give it to my brother. he loves ducks
do you have any spare spinal cords laying around? just treat us like any other people i think that would be the best way to help
it's usually the first question once the awkward barrier comes down
i can't. i've touched by dick though and it's really weird since i don't have a feeling below my chest. feels like i'm touching someone else's dick. so i guess you can say i've had a gay experience with myself?
i don't where i have no feeling. this is actually a major issue. because i can't feel pain my body's natural responses something called autonomic dysreflexia. basically if something is going on my body can feel it but i can't. so my body will raise my blood pressure and i will get the cold sweats. i've had my blood pressure as high as 220/150. this will give me excruciatingly painful headaches. usually the common causes are clogged catheter or bowel obstruction or even an ingrown toenail. i had to go to the hospital once because i had appendicitis and didn't know it and that's what was sitting off my autonomic dysreflexia
i was a tit guy for a long time but now that this squat fad has come around i'm starting to really like butts
you don't drink coffee....???? alright, that's all i need to know. i hate you. however, i am really very happy for you! my brother in law has cp and only really has any mobility in his left arm, and needs lots of help in his day to day. he had a spinal infusion a few years back, and just recently got his own car a few months ago. it has absolutely charged his life! i cannot image the emotions you have gone through since your accident, or how you must have felt to be able to stand up and walk again. i have to say, you are an inspiration to me. i truly wish you the best with everything, and hope more advancements are made to help you be more independent. sincerely, some internet bitch :)
do you watch any of scotty cranmers videos on youtube?
are you expected to continue regaining use of other parts of your body?
the website says $80,000 for anyone who doesn't feel like searching.
i am a sysadmin with 15 years' experience who wants to do something different now. i'll be honest, i never had much of a taste for coding, although i did do plenty of it while getting my cs degree back in the day. if i were interested in getting into the robotics/automation field, what would you recommend? self driving vehicles do look interesting, for example. thanks!
man its crazy how we all take walking for granted. most of us try to walk as little as possible.
so walk across the usa multiple times is the dream goal? i don't think i could even afford enough shoes for that.
the man i care for, finished high school, and college and is very successful at his job. he is also a quad, and the person i have the most respect for in the world. good luck to you
good luck on your application! although i hear the sidewalk accessibility at vcu leaves something to be desired. the school is fighting with the city about whos job it is to improve them. if you weren't already aware, /r/rva is a friendly sub to get involved in.
damn. the shitting one got me in the feels. you shit every other day? oh my god. i'm so sorry. you wanna hangout or something?
so you can maneuver your arm? do you have any nerve sensation in your hands?
sounds like my typical day. i work as an in home health caregiver. mostly with quads but also with clients who have ms and als. they are some of the greatest people i know. my suggestion is to educate your mind and learn new things with all that free time. also get awesome off road tires for your manual or power wheelchair and go on some adventures.
good answer for #4. i'm c5/6; i hate getting asked that question.
so...sorry if this comes up as rude but, no erections?
start a podcast, especially if you're looking into voice acting. write a book (audiobook). karaoke the first two are things i enjoy listening to, so i'm biased in my recs.
do you think you could get to the point where you don't need other people around you?
is your brother a popular redditor who magically appears in threads about ducks?
i have a kid who stares, should i tell him not to, or should i tell him to go up and ask you how it happened?
op, i'm another c5. have you considered a memory foam mattress? i went from a low air loss mattress (like a hospital bed) to memory foam and it was so much better. don't have to turn at night.
have you got an inflatable mattress that shifts the air around every few mins? life saver, and means no turning.
holy shit, that is incredible. i had never heard of that response before. how did they figure out it was appendicitis?
unfortunately no, but he can continue to work on better using what he's got now. thus, the exoskeleton in pt!
note: it's $80,000, but insurance can cover some of the costs. source: i am a grad student working on the indego right now.
i mean, to be honest that's not as bad as i thought. if 80k was a hard line for me to walk again, i'd find a way to make it happen.
when i was in my accident, i was told they would need to amputate or else i could die. i ended being very, very lucky and not needing that amputation but i was told i wouldn't be able to walk. a few months later, i was walking thanks to the help of my doctors, nurses, physical therapists and my new best friend: a walker. i wasn't allowed to bend my back, move my neck or my knee. i had to rely on someone to help me with every single day to day action for months. i never realized how amazing being able to hold my own toothbrush would feel, but i was so happy i cried. sometimes i get bitter about not being able to stand/walk for long. but then i just try to remember how lucky i am to be in pain, because it means i am alive. the smallest things are mountains to some people.
that sounded okay to me. i mean, my son shits like once a week and he does it entirely independently. he's weird and all, but it's not something everyone does every day.
it basically implies you shouldn't be as happy as you are.
a friend who was in a similar situation said it didn't. he still had all the urges. he asked the dr's to remove his balls, but they wouldn't. instead they offered 'chemical castration' (drugs): he said they didn't help at all.
that kind of stuff is controlled by the very bottom of your spinal cord. any serious spinal cord injury kills or severely impairs sexual function. also they can't get erections by thinking about/seeing "sexy stuff" simply because those signals can't get through the damaged parts of the spinal cord.
he mentioned that he still has trouble controlling his trunk while using it, so probably not. it wouldn't be safe for him to do it anyways. maybe with other tech though in the future
i ride my bike everywhere and have a fairly cheap helmet. i just ordered a giro chronicle helmet based on your recommendation :) happy to know my gray matter is more protected now.
there must be a weird disconnect between participating in online forums like this where your disability is invisible and then going out in to the real world where it is often the only thing that people see when they look at you. it's been interesting to read all of these responses from people in similar situations as op.
hope you don't mind my eli5 question but how come he will no longer continue to recover usage of his limbs? is there a certain time-limit to when movement recovery stops regenerating, like the control of his wrists? (hope my question makes sense)
yeah that is no where near as expensive as i had thought, makes me hope that in 5-10 years it'll be affordable for your average person.
he's not anywhere near me. he's a far farquad. source: northern alberta. nobody is near me. also /u/therickles when your classified ironman suit becomes available come to northern alberta. for no reason. look for the guy with wicked side burns/chops. i'll be in the bar or in my truck.
there was a post about this very issue a couple days ago. i believe the internet short hand for anti-sarcasm they came up with was /-s.
not a quadriplegic, but can confirm this is possible. there's even some self hypnosis audio tracks to help you have a hands free orgasm.
don't know if this is the case for op, but i have a friend who is a c4. he can totally get an erection, but has to be manually stimulated.
also will confirm. this is what amazes me about people like op being able to stay so positive about life.
i've read that this has to do with swelling. after a spinal cord (or really any big injury) injury the areas around it are super inflamed and pissed off and the inflamed tissue around it can compress the nerves or something? as time goes by and the tissue settles down you may regain more use of your limbs because those nerves weren't damaged, just being temporarily suppressed. i'm going off memory here though.
depends who you are and where you live. wheelchairs are subsidized 100% every 3 years for my son in canada. im sure if it drastically improves quality of life it would be just as subsidized as a power wheelchair, which can be *very* expensive also.
occupational therapist here. this is true and in cases of spinal cord injury it is called spinal shock. usually lasts up to 6 weeks. after this period you can strengthen muscles that are still innervated to increase function and make various adaptations to environment and task to increase the person's independence.
how often do you have to explain that you're not *that* ryan reynolds?
23 is a young age to get into politics, however, do you think the views of youth is accurately reflected in today's political environment, and if not, do you think that would change with more young people running for offices at all levels?
what was your path to being a mayor? like how did you get on the board of trustees?
wow had no idea whitney point had such a young mayor, and i only live 35 minutes away. any how, how was being so young and running for mayor first received? we're people skeptical of your age and possible experience?
how much impact has ben wyatt had in your life, and when are you building ice town?
i came by 'cuz i thought you were the other ryan reynolds! how is life in upstate new york? is there a serious heroin problem?
what is the first step, and maybe some subsequent steps, for someone who wants to get started in public service?
hi ryan! recently i have heard talk about a push to get more mayors involved in national politics, as opposed to governors and senators, because mayors tend to be much more community-oriented and understanding of what kind of change has to occur on a local level. mayor pete buttigieg running for dnc chair is somewhat representative of this movement. what are your thoughts on the view mayors can help bring to national politics that a governor or senator might not be able to? also what are some things that people often, mistakenly, think the president or congress are in control of, when in reality it is their local mayor or city officials in charge of issues that directly impact them?
i remember reading your name somewhere in my ap gov class. and yeah, we joked about you being deadpool about 50 times before it started getting less funny. sorry. anyways. how do you have time for gym, gaming, and game of thrones as mayor? do you have a lot of free time on a daily basis?
how do you feel about obama removing the wet foot dry foot law?
as someone who lives 30 minutes from whitney point. what do you think of the things that ithaca mayor svante myrick is doing? namely the safe injection sites for heroin user? i ask because we face an epidemic and the more respected officials we have advocating for harm reduction will help the fight communities face with addiction and the problems associated. thank you for the ama
what's the biggest thing you wish you could change about whitney point? what do you think is the best attraction for tourists in whitney point? where do you think whitney point has the best opportunity to improve fiscally for 2017? what will it take to make that happen? currently whitney point is receiving an "f" for education, a c- for employment, and a d for housing. do you think $800k would go further in education than a renovated building? or would $400k be better invested in attracting business rather than building a look-out? cost of living and crime both receive a's, congratulations on that - what do you think is the biggest factors are in receiving those grades? i've never been to whitney point. i'm actually on the west coast of canada. why should i go?
how will you convince hugh jackman to team up with you for deadpool & wolverine?
are you going to build a super cool winter sports complex for your citizens to enjoy? you could call it ice town!
hey ryan i'm from ithaca, who's older you or svante? do you two ever get together to discuss being young mayors? 2nd question do you get your water from the spring on 79? if not you should, it's more refreshing than fiji.
hello. of the jobs you had prior to your election, which one do you think prepared you most for the responsibilities of a mayor? did you ever play sim city when you were younger (or now, for that matter)?
how similar to game of thrones is being the mayor of a village in new york? i'd imagine very similar.
i ran for city council in small town wyoming when i was 24. i found it to be a neat experience. i got 35% against a four term incumbent. what were your first thoughts when you knew you won?
how do you feel about the recent presidential election?
would you like to keep moving up the political ladder?
*obligatory deadpool-related question* but seriously, what do you think of the whole 'there's more to new york than new york city' thing?
did you post this ama because you really wanted to talk politics or because your name is ryan reynolds?
when all is said and done, who do you think sits upon the iron throne?
do you think you owe your election to name recognition?
is whitney point considered upstate ny? i have never figured out where the dividing line is.
is it true that you represent less than a thousand people, residing in about one square mile?
who is your favorite character in game of thrones?
what's there to do in whitney point, besides stop at the rest stop on i-81 s or the gas station/mcdonalds right off the exit?
hi, i've never been to whitney point and i live in queensland in australia. so i took a look around in google streetview and i think it's a nice looking town. in terms of infrastructure, what's on the top of the list to get fixed there? bridge needs a lick of paint. just sayin'
which game of thrones character would you say has had the greatest influence on your political career?
hi mayor reynolds, syracuse city resident here. over the last three years there has been extensive talks in syracuse about the future of i-81 and now the governor is even coming out to say yet an other study must be done. i believe this could have implications across nys being that syracuse is centrally located and construction time is projected to be a number of years. are you familiar with the problem? if so, what are you're thoughts?
demographically speaking, do you see whitney point as mostly homogeneous, or is there a fairly diverse population? you commented that there's not a lot of politics involved in the day-to-day for you; do you think that can be attributed more to the size of your community than political unity per se?
i went to binghamton university and worked with whitney point preschool and daycare! kim downs is an amazing woman and the staff there is fantastic! any plans to support them?
top 10 games all time, and why is your favorite skyrim?
binghamton resident here! whenever i'm passing through whitney point in the summertime, i like to stop at one of the ice cream stands of rt 11. in your opinion, which one is the best?
if patrick stewart approached you with the proposal to join his small group of like-minded individuals who fought for greater tolerance, would you join?
how do you manage all of those things that you like, your job, and a stable life?
hi ryan, you seem to have a great personality and a true passion to serve from what i've gathered so far. (i'm also a massive overwatch fan atm) that being said, what are your opinions on college and higher education? do you think it's worth the money? what would you change about it?
like many rural areas of america, a majority of upstate ny is economically deprived; mostly from factories and other industries shutting down. what are some job creating industries or economic strategies that might work in an area like yours? thanks for the ama, i'm an graduate of cuse.
did you ever play games like sim city or cities:skylines? if so, how does it compare to irl mayoring?
our budget allows for the upgrade of one computer per year. i believe that the computer in the mayor's office will be upgraded in the 2017-2018 budget and i can't wait. i use windows 10 at home and it suits me well enough.
hey, man. a windows 10 license is like half the city budget.
i make $3,600 a year. i have another full-time job which essentially pays my bills. being the mayor of whitney point doesn't usually require 40-hour work weeks, it fluctuates but i think i do a fairly good job balancing my two jobs and personal life. one thing that's for certain however is that public service is one of my greatest passions and i consider it a true privilege to work for our residents and be a resource for everyone. i love it.
most people don't actually believe that i am ryan reynolds, they just doubt that it's actually my name. i get a lot of "seriously?" or "really? wow" comments. that said, when you become a mayor your first name just kind of changes to "mayor" and that probably helps the situation.
i first ran for office in 2008 when i was 21. i ran for county legislature and i got my butt kicked, but i met a lot of local residents and learned a lot. i ran again in 2010 and lost again, but worked even harder and learned even more. shortly after that election the mayor of the village at the time called me and asked me to join the board of trustees when a member had resigned due to a serious accident. so i served on the board for several years and then ran for mayor in 2015 when the sitting mayor decided to retire.
geez, you went right from lighthearted small talk to fucking depressing
yes we do. it's right on route 11. can't miss it.
i'm not much of a chef so i actually haven't made spiedies of my own. i stick to protein shakes, pb&j and scrambled eggs. that said, my girlfriend makes some great chicken and i do find it crazy that spiedies aren't known outside of the southern tier. it blows my mind. as for the hemp industry, i honestly haven't put a lot of research into it but i think that in general, we do need to open up more economic doors. we can't forge companies like ibm to come back here. that ship has sailed. we have to create new opportunities. hemp seems like it could be one of those, as could the medical marijuana industry. instead of trying so hard to fight the current and keep old business models around, let's open up the doors to new ones. i think that's the key to economic growth in new york state.
ryan reynolds was also green lantern before deadpool but no one remembers that. or maybe they choose not to remember that. anyway, just like any job or jobs, you develop a routine. i'm really big on making good use of my time, planning out my days, sticking to my schedule, etc. even if its something like "i am going to play overwatch with a friend from 8 to 10est", it's important to me that i stick to that plan. the other thing is, i don't have children yet. i have a serious amount of respect for everyone that does. yes, i'm a mayor and that's a big responsibility but so is caring for a human life and being responsible for their development. i often see friends from high school and they'll be like "wow, you're the mayor, that must be so much work!" and i'll reply "you have three kids, that has to be just as much, if not more work!" it's all about perspective, priorities and efficient use of time.
i think that the us-cuban relationship needs to improve and that we've seen some signs of it bettering during the obama administration. obviously cuba has some work of their own to do but being that they are so close to us geographically, we need that relationship to get better. and i think we can achieve that by opening more "normal" channels of communication and commerce. let cubans see what our country has to offer. i probably dodged your question here a bit by not addressing the specific policy that you referenced, but i've felt for a long time that us-cuban relations should be something to be addressed and thawed out.
i haven't done enough research into safe injection sights to be an authority on the topic. but there are two things that are certain; we have a serious addiction problem and the "old" ways of fighting drugs and addiction aren't working. we need new solutions and i think svante and the crew that helped him devise the plan deserve credit for thinking outside the box whether you like the idea or not.
best question in this thread. this is how political amas should be.
well op, answer the man. how do you, as mayor, plan to use your power to convince hugh jackman to team up with you in a movie? i imagine there is a law that could be passed. possibly some tax breaks that could be given?
that has never crossed my mind, although we have pursued a skatepark in the past. being a rural area, youth have to make their own fun a lot of times which gives us a fair amount of skateboarders and bikers. i used to be one myself. i've always believed that if you give people a place to go and somewhere to practice their craft and be constructive, they will do so. the challenge is finding a suitable piece of land and funding. thus far, we have not.
i went to college at ic actually so i'm very familiar with ithaca. svante is 3 months younger than i am. i actually turn 30 tomorrow. he and i have had lunch once and we've attended a few of the same meetings. he's a very down to earth guy. you never know, we may partner on something someday. as for the spring, i've never actually got water from there but i know a lot of people swear by it. but i use the village water since it is part of a system that the village manages...i'm probably slightly biased there.
right now i'm really into overwatch and destiny. since launch i've put over 1,000 hours into destiny. i love it and have high hopes that the sequel will fix many of the original games flaws. that said i've also played world of warcraft quite extensively, with my peak being between vanilla and wrath of the lich king. i'm currently making my way through doom and loving it.
i forgot to mention that i did play simcity when i was very young, but haven't played it in a long time.
well i haven't met any white walkers and i don't have a direwolf so...in all seriousness, politics doesn't play too big a role here at the local level. it's about getting things done for people. things like fixing the sidewalk on this street, helping connect this family to a resource that will benefit them, etc. there isn't too much drama or deal making or anything like that at the local level. village government really is street level. you can walk outside and point to the things that your tax dollars are going to. streets, sidewalks, water service, sewer, fire service, code enforcement, etc. i like that element of it.
my election was actually very intimate. someone who i consider a friend and colleague was my opponent and the election got very tense. my first thoughts when i won were along the lines of getting the ball rolling. i ran on a platform of achieving certain things for our community and i immediately got to work trying to make those things happen. i am very lucky to have a great number of people who have supported me, helped us achieve our vision, moved projects and initiatives forward, etc. i can't communicate enough how grateful i am for the things that people do for our community, for our village operation, for each other, for me, etc. but all in all, those were my first things. "it's time to get to work."
i would generally characterize my reaction as disbelief. i have always considered it a great honor to serve the public and something to be generally honored and respected, even when you disagree with the people serving. as long as they act in a respectful manner and try to do what they believe is right, i can have some basic level of respect for them, even if i despise their policies and proposals. what scares me now is that there is a person in charge who has no consistent way of thinking. he's short on patience, has no experience making decisions that effect a large pool of people and has never been accountable to anyone but himself. sometimes i think its good to upset the apple cart. sometimes a radical shift in perspective or tactics can be good. but i don't have confidence that this is the shift that our country needs and i'm not sure that a lot of people will understand that and/or the repercussions of it for years to come.
i think that's absolutely true. upstate new york has a lot of really beautiful natural resources, sites and cities. i just visited thousand islands for the first time a couple summers ago and it was a great, relaxing, tourist/vacation spot. i personally still have a lot of things in ny that i want to see and i enjoy the more relaxed rural life style of upstate compared to the city.
if all i wanted to talk about was my name, i wouldn't be here. i don't consider it an asset. it's just a designation. my mother actually named me after the actress meg ryan which i have always chastised her for.
jon snow. i think dany will take king's landing and ultimately (finally) realize that there won't be 7 kingdoms to rule if they are decimated by the white walkers. she'll go north, help in the final battle against the white walkers and die (probably sacrifice herself somehow). most characters in asoiaf don't get what they want or set out to get in the beginning so it would be the ultimate irony that she has been so set on winning the iron throne and then dies before she "really" gets to rule. i think jon will become the reluctant king in the end. it's not what he wants, but it will be what he does.
i don't think so. whitney point is a small village where most of us know each other. most people don't go to vote in a local election of this size and vote without knowing who they are voting for. they make a conscious decision to vote for the candidate of their choice. that's my opinion anyway.
that's a debate every year. technically whitney point falls in the southern tier region. i personally consider everything outside of nyc to be upstate ny because they're two drastically different environments.
jaime lannister. i think he's one of the most morally gray characters and i love his arc in the books. i'm still a little salty about how they've handled it in the show but i hope they can get it on track in season 7.
we have a lot of great places to eat. aiello's, sparky's, dominic's to name a few. we do need more entertainment. for both youth and adults. that said, i would recommend visiting dorchester park and ford hill golf course. two very underrated assets.
probably jon snow. at times when i am stressed i think about jon's decision to let the wildlings through the wall, despite his own brothers' opposition to it. jon knew that he was making the right decision and he went forward with it knowing the risks. he was ironically murdered for it but in the long run we see that it was the right decision to make and by fate, he breathes again.
i hope that's not connected to the internet in any way. support (security updates) ended april 8, 2014. maybe you should switch the local government over to linux. you'd get a lot of press for it. good luck, please don't use windows xp.
using windows xp is actually a huge security risk, especially for a government employee - of any level. even linux with wine would be better, man.
i'm also pretty sure you can get a free upgrade from the microsoft website as long as you use the accessibility programs.
wow! that's so surprising. it's so good that they have someone as passionate as you as mayor. what's your other job? how many hours per week would you say you spend dealing with mayoral duties?
that's exactly what i make for being the faculty adviser for the anime club at the high school i teach at. i need to be more appreciative.
there is a tank literally on the side of the main drag. route 11 i think
i like that idea of asking non-profits to contribute. while i firmly believe non-profits should stay tax free (i'm probably biased, as i currently work for one) as they contribute to the community at large, i also think that every nonprofit should contribute to the local community. we're i work they give us a paid off day a year to volunteer somewhere, and do various cleanups, and sponsor buildings/parks and such.
is that why you became a mayor in the first place?
relocating to southern california. the socal lowcal calzone zone.
reddit makes me feel like i'm not a total weirdo when it's made clear many people do the same weird shit i do.
as a guy just a bit older than you, having grown up in ithaca, i only have one question for you: do you really call it upstate? really? also, whitney point is pretty fun. i ran against (with? at the same time as?) a bunch of your guys in cross country. as for the heroin: look into methadone clinics. i don't know that there are any such clinics in the area, but, as mayor, you might have some connections to start the discussions needed.
how about jj's diner? bet you don't have those. not so smug anymore, are you?
my college (hartwick, in oneonta) just started a center for craft food and beverage to help support primarily local breweries as local production of hops and barley will have to ramp up significantly in order to comply with new regulations about calling the beer a "local" product. the idea is that the college can help support the industry in its growth and therefore contribute to job creation in the area. they're the only local facility that offers quality control testing and real-time crop growth advice (when to harvest, etc). so, not hemp, hops. ;)
still really surprised about the dedication to overwatch, but very impressed as well. i never really compared being mayor to being a parent, i don't know why, but thank you for that. p.s. we know about green lantern. we don't want to talk about it. or the fact that he was deadpool twice, but the first one doesn't count either. third times a charm.
as a canadian political science student around your age, watching the us from our northern armchair, reading your rational, reasonable, well-thought out responses gives me hope for you, our brothers down south. just wanted to say thanks for being a great example for people to follow and look up to.
wow. an amazing response. thanks for the good read.
someone do a hugh jackman & ryan reynolds ama request and ask them to come visit whitney point. i will be glad to give them a tour of the village and help them coordinate filming here. disclaimer: i am cautiously optimistic about logan.
my town (kennesaw, ga) built a skatepark in the local park and you would not believe how much it has changed. you see kids out all the time exercising and socializing, and a small economy has built around providing gear for kids at the park. it's been a positive addition for sure.
destiny! glad to see some love for my favorite game. what was your favorite expansion, and your favorite raid?
consider coming back for legion, it's really fun. i mean, between the whole mayor gig and all.
i've never played candy crush. i want to say that on record.
that actually sounds satisfying and kinda fun to be honest. i wanna see problems like potholes and tell people to fix them
how is your friendship with your opponent after the election? i'm really hoping you guys are like roommates or something now.
a fair question and a fair answer. most of us are used to larger scale politics, where that sort of name recognition would probably be a bigger deal than it is in a small town.
hey, you might have to make that kind of decision if the white walkers ever take over canada.
i am a store manager at my other job. over the years i've also written for a few gaming sites, namely xbla fans. i'd say on average i spend around 20 hours a week directly dealing with mayoral duties, but its always changing. sometimes its more, sometimes its less. and i never really stop thinking about it. even when i'm at home or at my other job, i'm always thinking about some program, some law, trying to solve some problem. it's all internal. and that is full-time.
that's great. our program isn't mandatory, it's optional. we recognize that not all non-profits can afford to contribute to the village's operations but we're asking and we're hoping that the program grows over the years. i think it means a lot that any local tax payer can see where their tax money is going and i hope that tax exempt entities who can afford it can feel good about helping to fund the local fire department or sidewalk repairs, etc.
the halo 2 campaign had some flaws when compared to halo: ce in my opinion. it lost a lot of the large open battles that ce excelled at and the brutes just weren't that fun to fight. that said, i was insanely hyped for it at the time, went to the midnight launch, drank the game fuel and have so many memories of the h2 era in general. i look back at it fondly.
deadpool 2 needs a scene or three filmed in whitney point. this is precisely the kind of mayhem deadpool would be into.
i think whoever owns that usename now knows they must pass it on. sometimes life calls on you to make big choices and this is one of those moments /u/mayordeadpool
come along to your local socal low cal calzone zone today!
looking for an obvious pop culture reference from a series enjoyed by millions is weird?
yeah there's another young mayor up that way. i don't know much about him but i did hear about his election. hopefully he's doing good things.
from utica/rome area. i've always thought it works this way: when you are outside nys or speaking to an audience outside nys, you call everything north of nyc "upstate". when you are in the upstate region, you call it your location central ny/hudson valley/southern tier/western ny/etc.
you're upstate. source: i'm from long island. you're all upstate. anything past the bronx.
former counselor at a methadone clinic here: don't look into methadone clinics.
wow, you're a pretty swell guy. i'd like to have a hip young mayor like you one day.
that's great to hear. that's how i envisioned it happening as well but i'm glad to hear evidence of it actually working that way. maybe someday...
i feel like the taken king was the best expansion all around. it brought destiny forward in just about every way possible. i think king's fall is also my favorite raid. i really like the scope of it. although i did just do wrath of the machine for the first time and i like that it's so different from the existing raids. i do find it disappointing however that we didn't get much background on aksis. he seems like a really intimidating and scrupulous foe. really looking forward to destiny 2. i think bungie has been extremely limited by their game engine and that when they apply the lessons that they've learned with destiny and it's expansions, destiny 2 will be a greatly superior game.
i've put the most time into lucio. i think i've got like 12 hours as lucio but i try to play all of them. my favorite offensive character is probably soldier 76...boring i know, but hey, he's effective. my favorite tank is definitely zarya. and i think d.va is currently overpowered. listen here, blizzard.
i actually did play legion for a bit. i took launch day off and leveled for like 14 straight hours. i think legion is the best expansion in quite some time. i'm interested to see where the story goes from here. hoping for an old god expansion next.
this is the kind of transparency we desperately need in politics.
i feel like this should be the cornerstone of your next campaign.
do customers still call you mayor at your store manager position? or do they treat you like any other store worker?
considering how passionate you are about doing your job, you're clearly okay with being paid so little but surely you're not being paid the minimum wage for being mayor? 20 hours per week is quite a bit of extra time to devote to it. you seem like a really cool guy, i love your passion and drive to do your job. you clearly deserve it. i hope it goes well for you in future :)
on the other hand, when boston asks various entities to pay a little more "voluntary" tax, it comes across as them shaking down organizations. "pay us or we shame you and make life harder for you, legally."
by saying this, you just made politicians seem so much more relatable. like, i did all that stuff. you're a mayor and i've had similar fun experiences. ty
can we all agree that the halo 3 campaign was pretty lackluster? not only was it short but it was artificially inflated by being mostly in the format of: - mission 1: go from a to b - mission 2: go from b to a - mission 3: go from c to d - mission 4: go from d to c etc nice to see the love for reach.
deadpool 2 needs to be deadpool running for mayor of whitney point against ryan reynolds (op). i mean, who wouldn't watch it?
i wonder if rr-the-actor would be willing to swing through next time he's in the ny area, purely for the sake of amusement? get him made the patron saint of whitney point, or something.
you went to altavista and typed "take me to yahoo?" come on jerry!
i went to high school with him. fun to see people take their complaints about potholes, etc. directly to his facebook.
yeah seriously, wtf is that guy talking about? obviously we call it upstate
i game pretty heavily, never played destiny. should i jump on now or wait for destiny 2?
i just sank all of my time into genji which isn't great because everyone plays genji. but he's just so much fun.
ryan reynolds 2020: he's not deadpool, **but** he doesn't play candy crush.
you're on target with all of this, except for what kind of offices a village of a thousand people has. i would bet less than ten computers, with maybe a beefier desktop in the broom closet as a server. not ragging on that setup at all. it's just a fact of small towns and villages. edit - actually, i wouldn't be surprised at all of it was more like 3 computers.
sudo apt-get upgrade. wireless stops working, spend 2 hours trying to figure it out. can confirm
imagine if he wasn't the manager? i'd love to be the one in charge of the mayor lol
hope he isn't a subway manager or he would be called mayor mayo
a $3,600 salary at 20hrs/week for a year equates to about $3 and change/hr. i assume very good benefits but even if he got paid double, he still wouldn't be hitting nys minimum wage.
yeah but that's boston and not a smallish new york town. it's obvious the mayor means well and the funds have a clear cut purpose/destination.
he lives upstate ny if i remember correctly. shouldn't be too tough!
315 represent! from what i understand (i moved away a few years ago), mayor barlow is doing pretty well for himself, especially having brought in a major grant to upgrade some of the downtown properties.
wnyer, same. the only time we use upstate is for north of albany or our dairy association.
i've never really had a problem with supporting, i do it more than any other role in a lot of games, but i do like to mix things up. i often find myself taking on less popular roles in games for that very reason; no one ever wants to do it. i'm a medic in battlefield, i healed and tanked in wow, etc. i do think overwatch generally does a great job of making the support classes fun though. i really enjoy lucio. my least favorite support is probably mercy.
live in town of 1000 can confirm 10 computers would be 1.5 computers for every staff member across town. server haha they use the isps email domain i should one day upgrade them to thier own... one day. they're talking about joining the whole area into a sort of city which if we take 100 miles by 60 miles will net us about 3000 people. then watch out we will be practically a city. kinda
imagine being an irate customer who is angry at the mayor and insists the manager fire him, and the manager is all like "i can't fire our towns mayor, it would be bad publicity" or some bs like that.
if he was in the military he could be major mayor
most small town mayors don't get paid at all. i live in a town of almost 40,000 people and our mayor doesn't make a dime.
he lives in bedford, which barely counts as upstate. but still, pretty close!
i've been offered money by /u/ernest_thornhill for my reddit account. no idea why though.
hope you made numerous comments in girls gone wild (or whatever the appropriate sub is these days) before giving him the password.
no benefits at all. i can almost guarantee. our small town pays slightly more, but definitely no benefits.
that's awful, but good. you know the person who is mayor is there because they want to be in it for the right reason, not for a big payout. it's awful because they should get a nicer reward.
it's just gonewild. girls gone wild is a series of vhs tapes sold in the 90s and early 2000s of women flashing the camera on spring break, primarily sold late at night on tv via mini infomercial.
many a young man's first experience with fapping matterial, those ads. i wouldn't be surprised if more than a handful of people commenting here right now couldn't rattle off the channels & regularly scheduled timeslots for those infomercials. like maybe ch.62, 1:30am on saturdays, or something like that.
do you have anecdotes about your time filming national treasure?
how did harrison ford manage to hit you with that boat hook?
what is the strangest/funniest thing to happen to you while on set?
you started in ronin, which is still the best car chase movie ever, any memorable crashes or moments from filming that epic movie?
have you ever played goldeneye for nintendo 64? how does it feel being a character in not only a movie, but a video game that has become a cult classic?
hello sean bean, i was wondering what your favorite comfort food is?
if you were going to war, would you rather take robert baratheon or aragorn with you into battle?
if you, the actor sean bean, had to go deep undercover in any organization, which one would it be?
mr. bean, can you describe the level of choreography that goes into fight scenes like you've been a part of in lord of the rings and as a followup, has anyone ever fucked up and actually injured a fellow actor in any fight scenes?
mr bean, how much did you know about game of thrones before signing on? did you know much about ned's character?
hello! big fan of your portrayal of boromir and ned stark. i wish i could have seen more of you on got! you make your characters someone that people can relate to and feel sympathy for. thank you for your work and for doing this ama! ok, question time. what was your favorite boromir scene to film? either that you had fun with or that you think helped with boromir's characterization.
what do you feel the real ending of silent hill was?
thanks for doing this ama! do you still play piano? any favorites?
how many times has a random stranger asked you to say "one does not simply ... (insert line here)"?
is the danny who owns broomhill friery in sheffield really your nephew?
did you keep/steal/buy any props from *goldeneye*? do you wish you had?
hey sean, massive fan. a few questions (you don't have to answer all): - is the story about you finishing your pint after a bar fight true? - who would win in a fight - boromir or ned stark? - does izabella scorupco really taste like strawberries? - which footy team do you support?
hey sean, if you were not an actor, where would you be right now?
i understand you live in london. as a yorkshire lass myself i'm interested to know what, if anything, you miss the most of our home land?
sean, serious question here - how often do you trim your beard? we both have similar beards and i've always been a fan of yours.
which role do you like the most to portray, a good guy or a villian? :)
do you ever keep props from your shoots (television or movies)? if so, what's your favorite?
i love your work man, got really into sharpe's rifles when i was a kid. my question: would you consider acting in the dragonriders of pern movies, should they come to fruition? i know you've done so much fantasy, but growing up i always read one of the characters in your voice, and just had to ask. super excited for legends. thanks for being awesome.
thanks for doing this ama. do you ever get mixed up with the other mr. bean?
hi, mr. bean, great to have you here on reddit! two questions. 1. what's your favorite dish? 2. if you were to play a superhero, which one would you like to play the most? thanks!
1. would you rather apologize to frodo or actually have that conversation with jon snow? 2. do you plan to work your way into the new star wars trilogy so that you can die in the first installment? somebody spared no expense and found the leprechaun in the tree, so thank you. also, let the record show that mr. bean is the first member of the fellowship to respond to my humble inquiries. i hope sean astin and dominic monaghan feel bad now. one down, eight to go.
it has been well noted that the characters you play have a tendency to die on-screen. out of curiosity, have you ever had any near-death experiences in real life? if so, how did it happen?
hi sean. don't usually comment on these but you're part of my very small claim to fame - i was in the crowd at bramall lane when they filmed you taking the penalty for when saturday comes! i remember you missing a couple and the crowd getting involved with chants of 'beano! beano!' i know you're a big sheffield united fan so how did it feel to film there? and to make that film in general?
will legends be a mini series or will it be ongoing?
what was your favorite movie/show in which your character didn't die? p.s. my friends and i agree that the fact your character lived by the end of the silent hill movie was the biggest twist. hope you have many more wonderful and inventive demises.
hey sean! what can you tell us about legends? the commercials look cool but confusing at the same time. how pissed will you be if they kill you off of your own show?
* how do you feel about not having a part in game of thrones for a little longer? * do you ever visit the filming crew and hang around? * who are you friends with the most from the got cast?
can you tell us a little bit about jupiter ascending? did you enjoy making that movie?
what was your first acting gig, and how old were you when you got it?
*the fellowship of the ring* is my favorite movie. thank you for being so awesome as boromir. now my question: does the fellowship still keep in touch? do you all ever get together to recount times from making the lotr movies?
hi sean! i came by to say that i'm a ***huge*** fan of your work, and have been ever since i first watched *goldeneye* (one of the greatest bond films, imo) as an impressionable young girl. i've seen nearly all of your films! very excited that you're here on reddit right now. on to my questions: * what's the weirdest encounter you've ever had with a fan? * what is in your pockets right now? i just found a nickel in mine. * are there any books that you are currently reading, and what is your favourite book of all time? thanks again for doing this ama, sean! :)
hi sean, myself and a mate of mine went through the whole sharpe series a while back and absolutely loved them. i'm always trying to get people to watch them, they're bloody brilliant and under-appreciated. one of my favourite of your roles, you fit richard's character perfectly. my questions are: * where was your favourite place to film during sharpe and why? * do you stay in touch with any of the lads or lasses off the show? cheers!
game of thrones spoilers (but seriously its a sean bean ama) when you read the game of thrones script, did you know going into it you would only be in for one season? or did you sign on then read the script for episode 9 and go "what the fuck? i die?!!!"?
you seem to love hinting about jon snow's parentage. what is the most cryptic hint you can give us right now about his parents?
do you admit now that one can indeed simply walk into mordor?
i know everyone here is going to want to ask about game of thrones, but as a long time fan of you as richard sharpe.... would/did you ever consider bring the role of sharpe to the big screen? also, do you find it as funny as i do that the character you've probably put the most time in front of camera portraying is just damned near *impossible* to kill?
when you begin preparing yourself for a new role, do you draw directly from past characters or do you start from scratch? thanks for doing the ama!
hello mr. bean! thanks for this ama! i recently read somewhere that you once performed as romeo in a theater production of romeo & juliet, decked out in full biker gear. i thought that sounded interesting and fun, could you elaborate on that story please? and which do you generally enjoy doing more, theater or film? i've always been a big fan of yours, you really are an amazing actor! looking forward to seeing your work to come. wish you had lasted longer on game of thrones, ned was the best of them!
game of thrones spoiler: is it a weird feeling to see just your head onscreen? i mean, surely it must be kind of strange in a way?
if you played dungeons & dragons, would you make a character based after one of your movie roles? if not, what race and class would you make?
would you be interested in acting in a game of thrones prequel depicting the events leading up to robert and ned conquering the iron throne and usurping the mad king? it could be a fantastic in-between season for game of thrones since the show's going to catch up with the books
there was one where i went back to nic cage's house, and we'd had a few drinks, we were playing pool and he accidentally knocked over his prehistoric cave bear skull and smashed it. and he was really upset about it, and the next day went and buried it in a field.
i once walked onto the wrong set. i was doing lady chatterley's lover, this was in the 90's, and it was like a studio, i had just had my lunch break and i walked back on set into the enchanted garden set, everybody was dressed in the same clothes, i sort of realized i was on the wrong set and wandered off. i was a little bit tired. i just saw all these actors that i didn't know, and i was like "*wait a minute"* - because it all looked the same, except it wasn't my film.
i've got quite a few, actually. i like chocolate. yeah. i do like chocolate. and i guess it's that and tomato soup.
robert baratheon. he's from yorkshire. that's why. why not aragorn? if robert got ahold of you, he'd crush you. you'd be careful not to get caught.
i'll tell you what i would infiltrate: camden council in london. to find out their plans...
yeah, that happens on occasions, you know? but fortunately there's been nothing too drastic, but they're usually very well-choreographed, very well-thought out. and there are stunt guys, a great bunch of people, very talented bunch, and they know exactly what they're doing. and i feel very safe with them in their company. but yeah, it's good fun, that. someone stabbed someone in sharpe, and it went through his body. that was on film as well! it was one of the early sharpes, eagle or rifle, maybe, in russia in the crimea, and the sword actually went like that *gestures to midsection* he was alright but it was a pretty shocking moment, because there were no hospitals around there, no ambulances, so if you got injured, it was pretty bad. but i've cut my hand open, you just kind of get on with the job, i split my knuckles open and got 5-6 stitches in them, on a set, and i went back and got back into the scene. i mean, that's not a big deal.
we did a good scene with me and viggo, where we just sat together chatting about our past and where we grew up and where we came from, you know, discussing how much was at stake at that particular point in the film. i always remember that. i enjoyed working with viggo very much, i enjoyed working with everyone, but viggo and i got on very well together.
there was a scene with bran near the tree - that legendary kind of family tree of the starks, near the pool of water, and i enjoyed that scene. i enjoyed the scenes with lena as well. she's great fun.
hahaha! they've not, i've seen people with t-shirts on, and i've said it myself. wait, i guess they have. a few too many drinks, and one says "one does not simply this" or "one does not simply that." it's a line i say in lord of the rings, innit? one does not simply walk into mordor. it's a great line because you can apply anything to it. it's immortalized.
yes. yeah. i mean, i knew it was coming, you know? but when i read it, you know, it just comes out of the blue and was a nasty shock. especially after ned stark thought he'd got some agreement between joffrey and the various factions, and for them to renege on that deal was pretty shocking. the scene was shot in malta, in this big square in malta, i think they built it, like a big public square, and it was good, it was weird, you know? because they made a cast of my head with hair on it, i've got some pictures of me holding my head. and it was fun. i don't know, you kind of just have to imagine what it's like to have your head chopped off, ann boleyn and how she must have felt. but it was the manner in which it was done, it was all the more tragic for that.
i got a watch, they gave me a watch at the end, an omega watch, which needs repairing in case anybody out there... and it's inscribed on the back "issued to sean bean, 006" and i think it's 1995. yeah! and that's right on the back.
i guess the humor, the people, and the particular blend of humor more than anything.
yeah, that'd be good. that's be good fun. i've never ridden a dragon before!
that would be nice. yeah. but i'm not sure. i guess that will be the main role, wouldn't it? so i don't know. good idea though. yes, many, many fond memories. and just fascinating, watching such an artist at work. he's a great man.
1) i did apologize to frodo, didn't i? or i told somebody to tell him i was sorry. and fuck jon snow. 2) that's a terrible question! i want to stay alive, and thrive!
this guy knows how to ask questions. good work buddy. i like how you roll.
i suppose the closest i came is a horses' hoof landed on my head. and it did actually! when i was filming sharpe. and i injured my neck, and i was pretty close, yeah. you can see it on film, yeah. it was a series called sharpe, yeah. sharpe's justice, i think.
oh that was one of the most exciting experiences of my life! it was a real, just, it was unbelievable. it was an incredibly fantastic just to be on the pitch wearing a sheffield united kit, trying to score penalties! my grandad and my father were there, in the crowd, so i was kind of waving at them. sheffield was playing manchester united in the fa cup, and we all went onto the pitch at halftime to kind of play a bit of foot and take some penalties, it was full of 45,000 people, and i think the teams were waiting to come on after the sendoff, and they couldn't get me off the pitch. i was so exhilarated. so we were holding back sheffield united and manchester united. the referee was getting a bit pissed off. i just didn't want to leave the pitch. the crowd was good, yeah! especially from the sheffield united fans, and i am eternally grateful for that. and the manchester united fans were a good lot, a good bunch.
i don't know, ongoing hopefully! you should tune, *all* of you!
i guess that would be sharpe, you know? the napoleonic soldier. and thank you very much!
well, it's a complex story, of a man trying to discover who he is, where he's from, what his previous life was. he gets flashbacks and he's trying to put the pieces together. and i guess that's why you see him in various different roles, various times of his life, and he's been told that he's not who he thinks he is. it's a psychological thriller with action. it comes from the characters, it's not action for the sake of action, people find themselves in very desperate situations. it's a very fast moving thriller.
yes, i saw it a few months ago. i guess boromir kind of, was one of my favourites. and the least favourite? any that were too quick!
i guess mark addy, i see him on occasions. it's a funny job actually, because you're all thrown together for an intense period of time, and then everybody goes home, it's a strange business in that way. but we always bump into each other from various productions, on the same kind of circuit.
about 4. (it's this brilliant kind of condiment, relish. you sprinkle it on your chips or your meat pie.)
occasionally we bump into each other, you know, doing our rounds. yeah. i bump into viggo occasionally, or orlando bloom.
no, i did know i was going to get it, at the end. and i signed on anyway, because it was such a good part.
i don't know?! i mean, how am i supposed to know? does anybody know? i don't think he's *mine.*
did they just sort of walk in? it's 'cause they're so small.
when you auditioned, did you know it was only for a season?
and tinned custard. with bananas. and i guess that's it really! i love milk, as well.
not fat robert though right? i mean he probably has a pretty good body slam but that's about it
hey, thanks for the response man! much love and good luck to you!
ah yes, that legendary kind of family tree of the starks.
at this point i'm shocked when a character i like isn't beheaded...
/r/watches would *kill* for a couple pictures mr. bean.
wait, wait, wait...are we just going to gloss over the fact that you just denied that you have parentage over jon snow? i'm onto you, bean.
the irony that sharpe was just about the only thing in which you didn't die
i don't think they have meat pies either, honestly i feel bad for them
that's the problem with hobbits, they always try and walk it in....
i think somebody (victoria?) is reading the questions to him and typing for him. that is why all the answers sound so conversational. i like it.
and milkshakes. mmm. mashed potatoes. *yeah*. meat & potato pie with gravy. like a cornish pasty. with henderson's relish, *yes.* that's very important to me. it is!
in the brad pitt ww 2 tank movie, "fury", an actor accidentally stabbed a stuntman with a bayonet. apparently, he thought it was a dummy.
oh god, trying to walk home in your corp shoes and your feet are sticking to the floor still
is a northerner what karl pilkington is? because i am getting that vibe.
this makes all the chain comments about food that much more hilarious. "wait a second, can we go back to that question about ice cream? i need to change my answer."
i love how you vaguely remember the stories from lotr and got.
keeps thinking of more delicious food and changing his mind. he's like a cat

everything anyone has ever said in favor of that theory is used as evidence supporting that theory.
someone tried to stab him, and failed? looks like the lannisters didn't send their regards that time.
wait, i haven't read the books but is there a legitimate non spoiler way you could tell me why ned would say" fuck jon snow" even if it's not his son he still raised him.
that's only a 25% deathrate then, innit? that's alright!
there's a 25% chance he will die at the end of it.
damn... i remember thinking the graphics were incredible.
the signmaker from one fish-n-chips shop stole his girlfriend, so he eats at the other fish-n-chips shop.
and all the tinfoil hat-wearers over in /r/asoiaf.
and dribbling down someone's beard onto the capons, fiery dornish peppers and brown bread still warm from the oven.
he's died in movies so many times, he's immortal in real life.
this is correct. such a nobhead, and he looked like richard ashcroft which annoyed me because i liked the verve
so he has the middle name of the greatest roman emperor of all time and his last name litereally means "son of bear" in swedish. just wow..
these are english words but why the fuck can't i understand you?
lol i don't want to laugh at the pain of someone else, but this is the most ridiculous thing i have read in a while on a ama. your hatred for this sign maker is spanning nations.
i'm american and have been married to my english wife for six years and i still barely understand her. when she's angry she sounds like yosemite sam saying harry potter spells.
the fire of my hatred burns bright and long. it's been...hmm...16 years. i still hate that guy
if you had to pick 3 key differences between you and the republican frontrunner, donald trump, what would they be?
hello senator, if you chose the current speaker of the house as a running mate, would your campaign be rand/paul 2016 or paul/ryan 2016?
hello senator paul, first let me thank you for taking the time to answer peoples' questions. what is your stance on edward snowden? or more generally, do you believe that there is a point where whistleblowing is the right thing to do, or should this sort of behavior be considered plain and simple apolitical crime?
hi senator paul! my question is: what issue/problem do you believe is the most important that our nation faces today and why? how would you remedy the situation? thank you! (from a huge supporter)
thanks for doing the ama, senator paul! what political figures/writers/thinkers have had the most influence on your thought, and in what ways?
as potus, will you release the missing 28 pages of the 9/11 commission?
a lot of reddit users support bernie sanders. what would you say, given the primaries turn out to be bernie and yourself, to best turn people to your side? also, i just wanted to say thanks for doing an ama! like seriously, you're one of the best candidates and you need more coverage
do you, justin amash, and thomas massie ever just hang out and get a burrito?
i love your plan to tackle the national debt. however it seems really hard to get people in congress to approve cutting back on things. how do you plan get congress to approve budget cuts to lots of programs?
if elected president in what ways would you help legalize cannabis?
hi senator paul, i greatly enjoyed your periscope stream during the gop debates the other week! that being said, i have two questions. 1) it seems that the gop party and the media have been trying to hide you in a sense, and keep people from learning about you, your policies, and your rank in the polls. why do you think they intend to do this? 2) bernie sanders recently released his healthcare plan, before the dem debate several days ago. what main faults, besides the tax increases, do you find with his healthcare plan?
senator, what is the one economic or classically liberal notion that you think fervent supporters of bernie sanders are missing or do not understand?
as president, how would you nominate your supreme court justices?
dr. paul, as commander in chief, what would you think the acceptable time to use an executive order would be?
what do you think the government's role should be in conservation and the environment?
would you rather fight one horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?
good evening senator paul, as a currently enrolled student in school , i work a part time job over the weekend to make a few extra dollars on the side. a big part of my paycheck goes torwards taxes , with federal tax being the most. if elected , how will you approach the issue of high federal taxes and unreasonable government spendings? thank you!
1. i have actual plans and policy to solve our problems 2. i in now way shape or form intend to shut down the internet 3. i have way better hair
first thing we should do is stop arming them. they ride around with a billion dollars worth of our humvees. we can stop intervening in civil wars and toppling dictators and making radical jihadists stronger.
it would just be paul 2016, saves space, we're trying to be conservative here.
the national debt. it's why i ran for office. it's why i'm running for president. we have to get it under control.
i come from an intellectual tradition that values liberty. i love reading hayek, mises, and rothbard. i started a reading program for my interns in the senate with books from these thinkers. we sit down and discuss them as a group each semester.
it should bernie vs paul. i'm afraid that it will end up hillary vs trump. which is a lose lose for most people.
thank you! a debate with me and bernie would be great. people would be well served by it. i've already publicly offered to debate bernie right now. in the dem debate bernie seemed to be uncomfortable talking about the actual cost of his programs for tax payers. we need real solutions without bankrupting our country.
definitely hilarious. i see it pop up on our social media all the time. i like the new version with me and my dad in it.
fighting for liberty does make you really hungry so yeah we do.
thank you! the first thing you have to do is have a plan. i've written detailed 5 year budget plans that have spending cuts in every department. we have to reverse what's going on in congress. the left and the right make deals: the left gets more welfare spending and the right gets more military spending. it's going to take the leadership of a president who isn't afraid to cut spending across the board.
i would remove prohibition of cannabis from federal law and give authority back to the states to decide.
it takes a lot of work. i don't let anyone touch a strand of it but me.
foreign policy. there are so many people who misrepresent my views as being isolationist and not being for a strong national defense. we make ourselves stronger by not being involved in every civil war around the world and not being the world's policeman.
so thankful that he didn't debate in the undercard, seeing him on the same stage as fiorina and santorin struggling to stay relevant would have broken his campaign.
eventually with socialism you run out of other peoples money. also, what bernie seems to not realize is that all of these new programs, taxes, and regulations have a real effect on everyday people and their wallets.
doctors don't want the government to tell them how to run their practice and patients don't want the government coming in between them and their doctor. i come from a family of doctors. far too many people are telling their kids not to go into medicine because there's so much bureaucracy and government interference.
they forced you to attend? i always thought the big crowd was legit - that's awful!
i'm running for president. i hear the current president didn't answer this vital question. we should expect more out of the next president. obviously the answer is 100 duck sized horses.
it's because hillary is secretly a neocon and they all secretly want her to win.
i'm the only candidate with both a flat tax cut that gets rid of the irs and a 5 year budget plan. we should be able to do both, cut taxes and reform spending. randpaul.com/issue/taxes
is this a joke? if it's only "a few extra dollars" then you likely don't have to file. you get the standard deduction plus your exemption amount which probably is more than your part time income. after that, the first several thousand is taxed at 10%. please tell me about these high taxes you are paying.
how hard was it to only come up with 3 key differences?
wow i didn't know you were actually pretty funny and cool. that's refreshing. i truly wish you were doing better in polls. i'm not a republican but you certainly seem like the most honest candidate running on that side.
trump isn't too bad on guns. but he's definitely horrible on internet privacy issues, whereas rand is generally good.
so you don't like their pool parties at our embassies? are you anti-fun?
i think you're the only candidate i've heard mention the national debt, which is incredibly sad. it's a huge issue. big fan btw.
id pay good money just to listen in on those discussions, that sounds amazing.
hmm. two politicians of character debating policy and fact? never gonna happen.
i honestly feel like bernie vs. paul would be pretty much a win win
to be fair to bernie the democratic national committee banishes him from all future debates this cycle if he does a non-sanctioned debate. the two party system is all kinds of messed up.
maybe we will see it in the general election debates
i love that this is the first thing he responds to.
why did every democrat but bernie vote against it?
crimes were never meant to be addressed on a federal level in the first place, the fact that this was a law in the first place is a joke. love you, rand
honestly, i see your name as a co sponsor on bills where democrats are listed as well. i really respect that and i think it's something more politicians need to do.
i'm starting to think you're winning reddit over. maybe tomorrow i won't see a sanders post.
wow. just wow that you're such a reasonable candidate and there are other war mongerers who are getting more attention.
thanks for being so awesome, rand! we absolutely need more politicians like you.
i know sauron, great guy, great developer. his towers are huuuuuuge, almost as big as mine.
hey senator, i really appreciate you doing this ama. i actually just started medical school back in june of last year, and i have started getting more and more exposure to the healthcare system since. one thing that has really stuck out to me is that private insurance companies seem to be getting between doctors and their patients, and higher co-pays are a barrier to a lot of people trying to access the care they need. my question is: do you think that bureaucracy and interference from private insurance companies are equally problematic as government interference, and if so, what would be a good way you would like to address it? anyway, like i said, thank you for doing this ama. i really appreciate you fighting for what you believe in, and you are a breath of fresh air in american politics, even if i don't always agree with you. thanks :)
quote from the text, "it is time for nasa to look at ways to reduce spending.".
was that real bourbon that you had on the daily show?
making it tax deductible is an awesome idea. god, my parents would have loved that.
what, you thought the word "liberty" in the name wasn't meant sarcastically?
we will have all of this information posted in a mega-thread at /r/randpaul
you answered the duck/horse question. you're officially a cool ama reddit guest.
"this just in, rand paul supports tiny horse animal abuse." -the media, probably
the real question is would chris christie eat one horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?
100 trumps, even duck sized, is too many trumps. i imagine them running around like minions, and unsurprisingly, being drawn towards normal size trump as their master.
all you'd have to do is switch her position on abortion, and she'd be a middle of the road republican in the 90's.
he seems that way because he's actually smart enough to know a little about his audience before doing an iama.
more than a few people just google'd *"isis pool parties at us embassies"*
trump has actually; i don't want to be that guy, but he has talked about it on numerous occasions.
why do you say it's a huge issue? many phds would disagree
seriously. record the sessions and post as a podcast. i'd tune in every quarter!
i mean, i'd also watch bernie v. trump on pay-per-view, but only because it'd be hilarious.
pretty sure the gop does that as well, something came up when cruz challenged obama (?) to a debate on immigration.
sen. tammy baldwin of wisconsin, a democrat, was actually the only democrat who voted for it. bernie sanders is officially an independent.
only 106 pages? that is way too short, people might actually have time to read it before voting
this seems like a common sense thing. can't believe it's not a law already
legalizing it and making it easier for them to bank? i dont think i can fanboy any harder.
yeah it sucks to see your horse start the race in damn near last place
marco rubio literally endorsed torture and rates higher than him. ted cruz said he'd commit war crimes with indiscriminate bombing and he's second place.
we're going to build a wall and we're going to make gondor pay for it!
who the fuck is deleting all those comments and why? they're obviously not spam or even attack questions.
how is that even legal? we should absolutely have an opportunity to hear these people argue politics without it being scripted by main stream media
yeah tammy! as a born and raised madisonian i was very happy to see her go from my representative in the house to one of my senators. now if we could just get rid of that jack ass johnson.
why hasn't this been deemed unconstitutional by the courts yet?
the thing is, you shouldn't need a law to do things like that. freedom isn't granted by law.
technically not legalizing, just allowing states to treat it like alcohol.
trump is saying the only bad thing about our nuclear triad is that we don't use them enough.. all the rest are all hawks also
we're calling for a temporary ban on uruk-hai until we figure out what's going on.
that actually kind of happened. the black gates were originally built to keep mordor in.
more people need to see this reply. too many americans look at europe like some kind of utopia without seeing the consequences of the economic system
how is that legal? why isn't it legal for a private entity to have rules regulating what its members can do?
probably better than alcohol. iirc the federal government has a lot of strings attached to highway money regarding state alcohol/tobacco laws.
why were they built with a gate that opens from the inside?
the thing is: we might seem as some kind of utopia because on the one hand, most people are used to just rely on the government(s) to fix everything while on the other hand, we enjoy the innovation that free markets like the usa introduce to us. i personally believe (might be wrong, but empirically i think it's pretty obvious) that things like facebook, youtube, google, or even reddit could not have happened in an economic environment like the one i live in. so in some messed up way we have the best of two worlds.
a bigger question would be why is politics in america governed by two private entities?
yup, states can have a lower drinking age than 21, but if it's lower, then they lost 10% of their highway funding. i think a few states tried to hold out, but they didn't last long because of that lack of funding. in my opinion, it's absolutely ridiculous for the federal government to essentially coerce the states into doing this.
best of two worlds except that your economic sysrem, as you pointed out, does not incentivize creativity or hard work and the only real job is with the government. that sounds like hell to me
i think the states should individually be free to do what they want with alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. i agree that its pretty unreasonable for all the power to be in the federal governments hands.
whoa there you're gonna have to wine and dine me first
what was your all time favorite sketch to shoot for "key & peele"?
when can we expect a "30 for 30" on hingle mccringleberry? - or at least a jersey?
how often do people shout a-aron at you in public?
hey keegan and jordan! thanks for doing this ama. on a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you both wish you still had the show to "appreciate" election 2016? who are y'alls comedian father figures? whose work do you both appreciate/ponder on, that inspires you in all that you do? and i know keanu isn't even out yet, but if you could make a sequel to it in the future, what animal would you want to feature saving next?
when did you know fargo was going to be that good? it could have been a bad tv version of a very, very iconic film - but it bettered it. any good anecdotes that you can share?
you are well known as a team, for good reason. any concern of being tied to each other like that forever? what happens if one of you ends up the andrew ridgeley?
why keanu? i mean of all the possible names, why pick that one? was it just the silly factor?
hi keegan! hi jordan! i'm incredibly excited for keanu to come out! i've watched your show for years and get excited to see you guys in cameos all the time! you've done a lot of promo with this movie, moving from city to city, working with animal shelters due to your co-star being a kitten... is it more work than your show was? is this work more rewarding to you?
when's the last time you put the pussy on the chainwax?
what inspired the creation of keanu? also what would you think is a good thought process for writing comedy?
how many different cats did you use, and did any of them get adopted by either of you?
hey guys, love your work. my wife and i watched every episode of key and peele, plus try and spot each of you in other shows. how is your relationship offset? are you guys friends, or are you like jamie hyneman and adam savage or penn & teller where you're just coworkers? i know you guys ended key and peele so you could branch out and try other things. does that mean more stuff like keanu, or what? keegan-michael, since you have a hypenated first name, what do your friends and family call you? any truncated form or nicknames? also, do you still keep in touch with any of the madtv people (obviously other than jordan)? jordan, what about you? what do you remember from your madtv days, and anyone you keep in touch with? and for the both of you, is there anything you'd like to do, but just haven't had the opportunity so far?
what's the funniest prank you played on each other?
hi k&p, what was your inspiration to make a movie about a cat? i'd like to think it's the amount of redditing you guys do.
very good question, u/suaveitguy. you know, i think ultimately we both agreed that it didn't sound as good, "peele and key." that's pretty much it. we wanted to do something that kind of like reminded us of some of the great duos, and i felt, ultimately, like if i was second, that that would afford me some leverage in future debates, and things like that. wasn't the case.
my all time favorite sketch for key and peele would have been *michael jackson halloween*. it was one of the first sketches where we just kind of said, "alright, let's just do it." it wasn't about the lines so much as it was about literally making jordan laugh, and then hearing him pepper these one liners back at me, which was really just very free pure joy. i really enjoyed that sketch.
oh, you talking about schwartsie? you talking about arnold schwartzenburgers? arnold schwartzenburgers is my shit. he's my shiznits.
it just happened two minutes ago. i came out of the bathroom on our break, and someone just yelled it. and i said, "what is your name sir?" he said, "bartholomew." so, very often. it happens very very often. it's interesting when people just say it, because i go "that's not my name..." but they feel free. it makes them feel good, so who am i to stop them?
question 2: i would have to say that if i had two parents, comedic parents, they would be peter sellers and richard pryor. those are my comedic parents, and they inspired me because both of them were actors and i've always been i'm an actor first and a comedian second, and i think they both were that. richard pryor may not have known he was an actor first and a comedian second, but he was just a rare, rare talent. and the same for peter sellers. so they are my spirit animals in regard to my vocation.
question 3: you're assuming that keanu doesn't make it out of the first one. talk about a dystopian future.
yeah, i mean we were very nervous going into it because we were such big fans of the film, and it's kind of like, why would we be in this? why would you put key and peele in this? would we not be distracting? and when we got there, noah hawley - the guy who created the show and is the showrunner - he's such a genius. he has a real patience and poise to him. i think we kind of figured it out as we were there. now as far as stories go, we were in calgary, and it was freezing.
first off, well integrated, based off some of the themes that take place in *keanu*. i don't think that there's a risk. we're gonna be together for a long time, but we have already made concerted efforts to go out and do things in our own voice. i'm not too terribly concerned. the things that we're doing that are different than *key and peele* are so varied, and so different, that you've got to understand that we're two separate entities.
you think you have it bad, but you at least aren't balakay
be glad you aren't named "jake". oh, jake from state farm?! how original! hahaha!
you done messed up aa-ron. i bet you're *insubordinate and churlish* too
ironman or batman. is that batman in like a servo suit or just like, regular batman using his stealth and his wits? because that's the question. i'm sorry, i just answered a question with a question, but i need more data.
you know, it wasn't as calculated as a lot of people think. there's definitely the fact that the movie is a love letter to movies. we do love keanu, we love movies like *point break* and *speed*, and we wanted to put these characters in an action world. really, it all came a moment where when we came up with the idea of the kitten it was the first name that came to my head, because i love names that only have one connotation. once you say you're gonna put a kitten in it, and the kitten's name is keanu, from that point forward it's a done deal. it wasn't too calculated.
it's hard to measure. we'll see how rewarding it is when the checks start coming in!
we really wanted to make a movie for us. we didn't pitch this movie. one of the key & peele writers, alex rubins, and myself wrote this on spec. so, we basically created what was to us the perfect key & peele movie and we wrote the whole thing, the first draft, without a kitten in it. and then we realized we needed something to bring us in and bring the heart to the movie, so we came up with this idea of this kitten that wears a do-rag and we put it on the poster and everybody who doesn't know key & peele would hopefully have to go see the kitten do-rag movie. besides that, any movie that we've ever really laughed at is a movie that we've cared about the characters. so, keanu is a way for the audience to reaaally, reaaally root for our character through the whole arc.
that's a great question. seven kittens were used in the film interchangeably. neither of us adopted any, but of the seven i understand that three of them have been adopted by members of our crew, and then the other four as far as i know now live on the farm where trainers live with all of the other wonderfully intelligent and well cared for stunt animals.
as with all amas, the best question is sitting right in the middle. never to be answered.
are cats really big on reddit? is that a thing? i'm not quite seeing the connection, but, you know like we said, we wanted to...there's a lot of gangsters that have exotic pets; this is a phenomenon. apparently, there was a guy in the bronx who had a tiger in his bathroom, and so that was some of the idea we were jumping off of to make method man's character cheddar be a guy that collected a bunch of animals. he also has a snake in the movie. he has a boa constrictor or a python. and then he has keanu, who is of course the least fierce animal. but, put him in a dew rag and a gold chain, and he's a badass.
keanu is a real kitten and like i think in a question we answered earlier, there's about 7 young cat actors that we used for keanu. all real, all practical, nothing cg.
and if you say peele and key really fast, it kind of sounds like *peelenke*. which is probably some russian word.
china makes solid jerseys. my penn state mccringleberry jersey is one of my most valued possessions.
remember that one, where he was in the jungle? and that dude came out with the dreadlocks and no mouth? and the vagina face? that was my jam.
as an aaron i just want to tell you you ruined my life
if i stopped you on the street and asked you to do a coach hines leg kick while i use my finger as your mustache would you do it?
twelve degrees below zero, all day every day, to be exact.
we're doing good! we're very excited to see what happens with keanu, april 29th. it was just such a joy to be able to shoot a movie, and a movie with this cast. i think it could be a movie that could be a phenomenon that goes on for a long time. i think people will watch it and rewatch it and rewatch it again, so...we're doing good!
i know a jake who works at target. red shirt and khakis are the uniform. that poor guy.
we'll say that batman, no servo suit. it's good old-school batman.
oh come on the name was a joke at john wick. a guy single-handedly takes down the mob because they killed his dog? it just screams parody movie! please confirm if john wick had anything to do with the naming.
and i would say a thought process for comedy is always think in juxtapositions. you have the most vulnerable, fluffy, cute thing in the world and the majority of our movie takes place on the gritty streets and in a dank, grimy strip club with a bunch of gangsters. so, you're taking kittens and gangsters and mixing them together. or you're taking nerdy guys who have to pretend they're assassins, guys who've never handled a gun are pretending to be the two greatest assassins in the world. so, you just take opposites and you smash them together and you use juxtapositions to make people giggle. to make people say, "oh my god that's ridiculous, how's that happening?!" so, if you're writing comedy, to think in that way is always helpful.
favorite dinosaur...i don't know that the keanuosaurus places for me.
i don't remember if i did. what's the explanation?
we play a lot of characters that would suck to be trapped in. i would probably go with...ugh, they all have problems, don't they.
it is russian actually, there's no direct translation to english but it roughly means, "don't put the banana peel before the solution. "
"it's called brainstormin' not braindrizzlin', sweet pea..."
a note for people who haven't seen gremlins 2: these are all characters in the actual movie. i hadn't seen the movie when i saw the sketch for the first time, so i thought they were making them all up
see that bandage around his finger? slapped too hard on his desk.
so it's been lucrative for us *spiritually.* so yes, that's the answer. it's in the works.
do you have a link to a completely legit buying source? i may be in the market for one
you know man, i like the one where he was the second one when he was the computer monster, and he was talking about, "i'm here right now, but i will be back as well." that's like the greatest line that was ever in a movie ever.
yeah, i remember the first scene we shot was our first scene in it, where billy bob is going up through the building shooting, and afterward we find that somebody's been thrown out of one of the windows on the ground. and between every single take, the guy on the ground had to get up and go warm up off in a van; it was *that* cold.
he should change his name tag to "heard it already."
like adam west batman? he's gonna make ironman laugh?
please tell me person-keanu has a cameo in cat-keanu's movie then...
that makes sense to you, right? i'm not winking, it just makes sense. when i slept i really *really* put the pussy on the chainwax in my dreams.
great advice. you really put the pussy on the chainwax.
i know bobby lee has stated that he won't join the cast unless key, peele, and everybody else joins.
i don't know that it's even in my top ten, the keanuosaurus.
they were driving very far away to say biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch
i believe the closest english idiom is "put the pussy on the chainwax."
can i just say it's awesome that you guys are answering questions even 9 hours later? one of the coolest amas in a while.
i remember there was one point in time where this poor gentleman was on the ground shaking because he was laying on the bare cement, twelve degrees below zero, and the director walked up to him, and was very kind, but he said, "i am so sorry, but is there any way you can not shiver when you're laying there as a dead body? i'm gonna need you to not shiver." which was crazy!
trying being a guy sharing the name of a jewelry store and a child molester now. hahhahah he went to jared haahahah fuck.
i'm thinking michael keaton batman; robert downey, jr., tony stark.
in a movie called *tepid*. it was called *lukewarm*. not heat, so much. but it was good. i mean, there was heat between us, like comedy-love. but, yeah i just thought he was very clever, very brave onstage. so i couldn't wait to meet him. but in real life, i thought when i first met him that he was very thoughtful. and grounded, which was nice.
i got up, i got some coffee, i filled it right up to the perfect brim. filling that coffee up with the pussy on the chainwax.
i would have to say my favorite dinosaur...i'm gonna have to go, trike. triceratops.
that would be egotistical. i watch exclusively bad reality television.
for some reason i can imagine that. you guys go in, and they're like "no, they did this last week." "last week? what? who's they, abbott and costello? who's stealing our jokes? we've got-" "no, the politicians. the politicians did it last week." "...oh. really?" "yeah."
boy, that's a good question. i'm gonna still go with - if it's regular old batman - i'm going with ironman. more evasive power, always perpetually has armor, and he can attack from far away. and batman's only got the batarangs, maybe he uses the car to his advantage at a certain point in time.
and the drugs. well...we may have spoken too soon...
you had that surface tension on the top of the cup? brother, that's when you really put the pussy on the chainwax.
like when we did the aerobics sketch, the sappy dance sketch.
our next movie's just gonna have a computer generated baby with our voices.
you're sure you don't want better and better hats for the rest of your life?
jordan has strongly encouraged me to start watching "naked and afraid".
i mean, let's be honest. really this is a corporate war. both billionaires.
it's rewarding in a different way. i'd say that there are things that have happened on the show that we were trying to achieve a specific goal and we achieved it. that's something that's very fulfilling. then here, it's the same thing with the cat. so, i'd say that it's apples and oranges. it's equally as rewarding.
oh yeah, we had one of our crew members come and dress like the aerobics meltdown characters, and start dancing with us in the middle of the sketch. but you gotta know the guy to know that that made perfect sense.
a baby riding a kitten that breathes fire. the baby, not the kitten. and then we're just gonna throw tyrion lannister in there, just for good measure.
straight up took over the ama to have their own party.
i just wanted to say "foal," and when you said baby cow i thought of a baby horse so i said, "foal".
it should say something that we left our show to do movies.
yeah, not a lot of practical jokes. the jokes themselves were practical, in as much as that we were taping them.
i was just thinking green peppers in my head and how much i enjoy them, but then i realized, i wouldn't want to recommend putting them on a pizza liberally. because, then you're just eating green peppers with dough. very overpowering taste, very aggressive.
maybe the most elaborate was convincing keegan that we actually had a show that aired on television, and every wednesday night i would have to go to his house and put a dvd in his television of the stuff that we did.
welcome to reddit! if you could tell one thing to every person in the world, what would it be?
hey gray, i'm a 17 year old battling brain cancer now. do you have a favorite doctor/nurse that you love talking to? and what advice would you give to me or others who are battling childhood cancer?
good morning gray. i've been helping my wife through a similar situation for a bit over 5 years now. four bouts of various types of cancer (gastrointestinal [neuroendocrine carcinoma], cervical, ovarian and now, just last month, stage 3 melanoma) how have you dealt with the depression and/or isolation that typically comes with this ordeal? michelle, as a caregiver, same question.
good morning gray! hopefully you're having a good day. what do you feel most proud of?
hi gray, thank you for sharing your experiences with us! what has been the hardest part of dealing with your medical issues? would be interested to hear from your mother about this as well.
hey grey! first off, just want to say that you're an amazingly strong young man for enduring what you have. i just lost my mom (4 months ago) to cancer after a 4+ year battle. she's the strongest person i've ever known, and i can only imagine what it was like for her, but i'm so happy that you've fought just as hard as she did, and you're still at it! people like you two inspire me and millions of others to never give up in life. also, what are your top three favorite games? happy holidays!
hi there! as a current medical student/future physician, do you have any advice for me either about a really positive experience you've had with your doctors or even a particularly negative experience that you'd want to share with me? thanks for doing this, hang in there and keep fighting! i'm on your side, fighting against cancer, just from a different angle! you are inspiring with all your positivity!
good morning awesome folks! as a fairly new father, having something like this happen to my daughter is one of my greatest fears. so i guess this question is aimed more at lady crimson: what were the early signs of gray's illness? what led to the discovery of his tumors? you guys are great and i wish you all the best in the future. thanks for doing this.
good morning gray, do you believe in an higher power? me being in your situation, id always think "why me?"
hi gray! you're the man! what's your favorite kind of music to dance to?
i can only imagine the pain you've been through. if i could ask what exactly is the kind of brain cancer that you have and are you currently in remission?
hey gray, i'm a neurosurgery resident currently at our children's hospital and work with kids with brain tumors. what are some things that you and your parents appreciated (or maybe didnt appreciate) from your neurosurgeon? it's an understatement to say what you and your family have been through is challenging, but your attitude is awesome. keep it up.
med student here. what was the thing staff (docs, nurses, etc.) did that made the biggest difference in your life? i don't mean treatment-wise, but rather something they said or did to ease your suffering when you needed it most?
morning gray, hope your day is going well. if i may ask, what advice would you give someone who has just been diagnosed with brain cancer? also thank you for the ama!
hi gray! do you have any weird favourite snacks? i personally like eating anchovies straight from the little jar sometimes, maybe you have something new for me to try :)
what are your opinions on medical cannabis and what is holding you back from cbd trials?
hey brother gray, what's your favorite baseball team?
hey gray, how do you keep up with your studies? and is the a subject that is your favorite?
do you get tired of people focusing on cancer as a defining quality of you? i mean, would you rather people talk about something else more often with you?
ayo captain gray! if you won a million dollars what would you do with it?
hi captain gray! do you play any kind of video games? pc, console, or mobile, it doesn't matter. if so, what kind of games are you inclined to? first person shooters? or racing games? or role-playing games?
hey gray, i see you've chosen to rock a double bracelet and middle finger ring, which i dig. what is the story behind the ring? what other pieces do you have in your collection?
hey capt. gray. in may 2016, i was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) brain tumour. is that the tumour you have? they cut mine out then, but it's a very aggressive tumour, and it will be back. i was told at diagnosis that i should go home and get my affairs in order. that was in may, a little over 6 months ago. apparently, most people with gbm are dead a year or two after diagnosis, and living beyond 5 years is very rare. if gbm is what you have, well done for making it to 10 years! i did the first 6 weeks of daily radiation and chemo, but have decided to let the cancer take it's course now. as you would know, chemo is very hard on the body.. i'm old, and i don't want to go out fighting. whatever you do, keep it going.. 10 years is amazing! you're well ahead of the curve.
hi gray. i'm just about to start a new job as a youth worker for a tertiary-based youth cancer service. i'm very excited, but obviously also very nervous. would you have any advice, from your own experience, about what it's like having all these people working around you, and how i could make sure i do a good job for the young people i'll work with?
hey gray, please let me know how you would want people around cancer patients treat them? let me explain: i understand that pity is out of the question, stupid encouragement like "we will do it together" is too, fake optimism, constant pity - all of this is crap. what do you want people around you to say, to do? please help us... hope you understand my question, i feel very awkward even asking you this...
i currently work as a hospice care giver. is there anything i can do to make my patient's experience/life better?
hey gray, whats your favorite movie/tv show? ever thought about going heisenberg and just cooking meth?
picu nurse here. what do we do right? and what do we do wrong? keep fighting!
what's it like to realize you aren't on deaths door and leave hospice care? what's the feeling when you have to go back?
while alot of people will hate this. do you ever feel that existing has cost your family money, time, effort for an essentially futile endeavor?
i would like to spread awareness about brain tumors. support the fight against childhood cancer. may is brain tumor awareness month. i'd like for people to support it more especially during that month
just try not to think about what you have. let your family or whoever take care of that. just focus on being a kid. you know who i got that from? m. o. m.
i feel like i get depressed and alone but i always remember that i have people to help me through those moments. and when i remember that, it makes me feel peppy again. that there are people out there that are cheering for me and it helps me not feel alone and conquer what i'm going through. from michelle, keeping him involved with people with similar conditions. like coachart. when you do things with coachart, there are families and kids with similar situations and we get to be together as a group. creating opportunities to share within the foundations we are involved with is an outlet for him to share. it creates a support network gray says i like coachart because it helps me meet people who know how i feel and it makes me feel better because other people really don't know how i feel
how does someone get so much cancer? genuinely curious, this can't be coincidental. is she somehow genetically susceptible to cancer? hope she makes it through
i don't know how you feel about it or how the incredible op feels about it but marijuana really helped me through the depression. i did a big regiment of chemo for 3 months and pot did a lot more than help with nausea for me. the euphoric effects were exactly what i needed to help keep me sane. the best effects came from eating pot butter in baked goods or spread on toast. that way it lasted longer and i didn't run the risk of a cough puke. i still smoked it when i needed immediate help though. now i use it to help with the stomach pain from a horrible surgery i went through. i hope you find something that works best for your wife.
i'd like to say thank you and i'm sorry to hear about what you lost. but just remember, there's always a silver lining at the end of the rainbow!
to find a cure to brain tumors. i have lots of dreams but that's my biggest dream. i think 7 kids die from a brain tumor each day. i could be wrong about how many but that's scary to me
hi! just the fact that i'm still here and still going. any time that i'm feeling down and having a bad day, i remember that i'm a brain tumor survivor and that's not by luck. it's a little luck but we've fought hard
just going through treatments one after another after another after. every time i have an mri or surgery, i'm wondering "am i gonna make it or am i gonna die? sometimes i wonder if this is the last one." mom said hardest for gray has been the anxiety and anticipation of going through treatments. that's always been the hardest.
that touched my heart, thank you. skip bo, monopoly deal, and uno attack. this is from joe, i can tell you first hand gray is savage in skip bo
making moments out of everything. if you're saying something can't be done, someone else is doing it
yes i do. the patient is always right. the patient and their parents are always right. listen to your patient's parents and also listen to their parents. don't look at them like they're crazy. just trust them. they know what they're going through more than you would know because that's why they came to you
i'd love to piggy back on this question as well: i believe that healing involves much more than medicine. earlier you (captain gray) said that the scariest part was the anxiety of waiting for treatments. my question is: have you received holistic care during your treatments? if so what are some of the best examples of health care professionals going beyond their typical roll to help ease your anxiety?
from michelle, something seemed off. i would say motherly instincts. something seemed off that i couldn't figure out and i would take him to the pediatirition. it was pressure in his head that would build up at night and he couldn't sleep. he would wake up very disoriented. after he would be up for a while, he would be fine. anything that is persistently off, he was symptomatic at four. i didn't get him diagnosed until six. you kind of have to go by developmental milestones. but it's hard to tell at that age and you don't want to take him to the hospital all the time from gray, people thought my mom was crazy. but she was right
i used to feel like god chose me to pick on me. i sort of still feel that way a little bit. everything happens for a reason but i wonder why god chose me to have the brain tumor? michelle says "one day gray said, you know what mom? sometimes, bad things just happen. and not for a reason"
rock and roll! my favorite song to dance to is "i love rock and roll" he just sang out the chorus, too
from michelle - he has diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma throughout the brain and spine. he is not in remission, we do the best we can to manage tumor growth and all the effects through chemo and surgeries
from joe, i actually have a classic gray story. he was beating me pretty bad in skip bo one day, i was completely out-strategized. i said "gray, you know that you are really smart, right?" he responds, "well, i do hang out with a lot of neurosurgeons."
my favorite thing right now is cauliflower rice mixed with eggs and bbq spices. yeaaah
from mom, we actually tried it like five years ago. had to get him a card. we didn't try it as a treatment, we tried it for anti-anxiety and neuro calming effect. at that point, they didn't have all the blends so the amount they were giving was so much that he would be knocked out. that prevents us from being able to maintain accurate neuro status and that's very important
dodgers! i have friends that play on a little league dodgers team so that's why
donate all to brain tumor research. to find cures for brain tumors
zootopia for movie and young justice for tv show. it's like the justice league but they're kids. so like, martian manhunter's daughter and the flash's son
thanks! what is the best way for us to support it?
**transcript:** **awesome joe:** alright gray wanted to send a video for the first one. gray, the question is what would you say is the thing that keeps you so positive in the face of having dealt with this for 10 years. **awesome gray:** alright because i feel like it express art without having to use my words because some people think say oh he's just saying anything words are words. when in my opinion i feel that i can express how i feel. and if i'm ever feeling angry i can use that anger to input into and do it my art using all that negative energy and make something positive out of it. **awesome joe:** and what are you doing right now? **awesome gray:** we're doing christmas crafts! paging /u/arexbawrin and /u/atropicalpenguin
thank you both so much for taking the time to do this. honestly.
it's amazing that he is so smart for a 16 yr old who obviously has had to deal with so much else in his life. when your typical 16 yr old who had a great life is much less educated and has such a bad outlook on life. keep up the fight
i'm sorry i couldn't understand some parts and i wanted to make sure i got the whole message. can someone write the transcript?
somebody on reddit has to know johnny depp in real life, tell him about this.
idk what that even really means but it's such a lit response. now i want pirate gear for christmas too!
this made me lol! where does one find pirate gear? good luck, matey.
if you don't watch the anime one piece, you definitely should. it's about pirates.
this is super touching. no questions from me but this inspired me to donate to coachart today. i'm sure many others are going to do the same based on this.
we've tried with sporadic success, but more often than not it doesn't really do much for her. no chemo/radiation for her, the most was sandostatin, but the nausea is a thing due to the damage from the surgeries. phenergan doesn't even work.
amazinggray. i want to say your story really touched me. it is truly incredible the heart and soul you possess. thank you for this post. anyway, i see you have an interest in games. well, i do not know if you are aware, but there is whole new world of modern board games. many of them pirate themed. i would like to send you one, for yourself and the other kids in treatment. i think you guys could have a lot of fun with it. if this interests you, please send me a pm. i can try and have it there by christmas.
two of my biggest scares as a younger nurse were when a mom told me "something is off, this isn't normal for them." in both cases i ignored the concerns and placated the parent as i could see nothing concerning, in both cases the patients nearly died, i've learned to listen when family sees something i don't.
from michelle, gray had a doctor that was one of the first to treat kids with chemo first instead of radiation. it was much less invasive. he wanted to try less invasive treatments first. he used to always say that he was "cautiously optimistic" which was very comforting. his current pcp is great
hey gray, thanks for sharing and doing this ama. it's incredible what you've been through. i think you are right, sometimes terrible things happen to us and the people we love for no reason. two and a half years ago my daughter passed away and i felt the exact same thing, that god was picking on me, or punishing me and my wife for whatever reason. it's still hard to try to find meaning in any of it. the fact is, the world is messed up and full of bad things. the only thing that brought us through was our faith and the hope that we can see her again in heaven. maybe there is nothing after we die, but i will hold on to my hope that one day we will have new healed bodies, and be reunited with our friends and family. it may not mean anything to you, but i will pray for your healing. if you ever want to talk about this, or anything else, feel free to send me a pm i'd be happy chat!
my lovely lady found a recipe for a boiled cauliflower and sweet potato mash. if you find the recipe... don't get your hopes up. just stick with the riced cauliflower and eggs. ;)
i'm curious as to what hospital is making lit grilled cheese now
hey gary, if you get a chance checkout green lantern: emerald knights. one of the better dc animated movies to come out in recent years and has a similar animation style to jl and yj. p.s. based on your ama responses you sound like a cool kid. i hope nothing but the best for you and your family.
so wise. rather than just characterizing our emotions as 'bad' recognize the emotion and do something useful with it. i need to do more of this in my life with other emotions.
thank you, my silly deaf ass was having trouble understanding!
i feel bad that i needed this to understand some of what he said.
i'm 22 and fucking hate everything. this makes me feel shit
seconded. i don't want to be rude, the audio quality isn't great and, as someone who isn't a native speaker, it's hard to get the hold of what gray is saying.
he didn't say he wanted to meet a porate, he wants to dress like a pirate
please don't fail him reddit. send him a shit ton of pirate gear.
the way i always get through it is to imagine it as the worst dubstep album ever.
mom's have a truly amazing 6th sense about their kids.
although cauliflower drizzled with balsamic vinegar broiled and topped with parmesan cheese is amazing.
from michelle. yes, i have a bunch of different oils i'm going to start testing but he needs to be at a more baseline neuro status before we start
as a grilled cheese lover, i too would like to know where, and are they covered by my insurance?
man, this kid has reallly got shit figured out. he's happier than most of the people in our generation and has faced death so many times.
he literally answered with, "when life hands you lemons; make lemonade." he didn't get angry...he took what was given to him and made something beautiful.
it wasn't just "deafness." op was difficult to understand because of the toll that his medical condition has taken.
why? it's not like they don't realise his speech is sometimes hard to understand. joe has probably listened to it so much he recognizes different words. i think it's great someone took the time to write it down so everyone can understand gray's thoughts. i think he has a great attitude to life we all should learn from.
don't man, make it want to change your situation because you can.
*i feel like i can express it through art, without having to use my words. you could say "he's not really saying anything, words are just words" but in my opinion i can really express how i feel. like if i'm feeling anger, i'll do it- i'll put into my art all that negative energy and make something positive out of it.* **and what are you doing right now?** *we're doing christmas crafts!* ----- i'd like to point out this probably isn't perfect, but it gets the point across. stay strong, gray :)
a real pirate will know where to buy the best gear though.
for anyone wondering, flip side refers to "tomorrow", and not the afterlife.
i had one last month and the only thing i could think of is that that was the most sovietic experience of my life. it makes sounds of old machinery that you listen on the cold war movies or something. it's so strange because it looks super high-tech but at the same time they can't do much to lower the sound of it. it's like you're inside an engine. i slept through most of it, though
on the other end of the spectrum, i've seen munchausen by proxy first hand. pandering to that kind of behavior is dangerous
i think his trials are precisely why he is so happy. as a society we see happiness as dependant upon circumstances. we question how joy can be felt in the midst of hardship. however, we recognize that the people who pull through their trials see things differently than those who do not. these trials challenge us to answer the difficult question, "can i be happy despite my circumstances? is happiness something i can control?" in fact, many of us ask: "how can my circumstances make me happy?" or "what will make me happy?" *the answer to happiness lies within the question we ask ourselves and how we see the world.* gray has chosen the path of internal locus of control (we can control ourselves despite our circumstances) which leads to fulfillment and joy despite circumstances. many of us choose the the external locus of control (we have no control over our fate or behavior) a little philosophical, but worth thinking about...
i don't know why but i really respect the way you phrased that.
some chronic illnesses won't kill you, but they narrow your life down to sitting in your room, alone, counting the seconds. and you can't make meaningful changes
i honestly believe existing is a curse, i have used logic (i think, probably heavily biased by emotion though) to come to this conclusion, only way for me to change my mind is for someone to prove to me life's worth living. i also can't kill myself because the thought of not existing is just fucking horrible and acary
christ i'd never heard of it being referred to as the afterlife, now you're just bringing down my mood man
i found out that one place near me only takes 15 mins to compete the mri. it's like $200 more then the other places and because i was in a time crunch and they had an opening i just said whatever and paid the extra. omg if you are anything like me and can't stand those things this is worth every single cent.
my mom was accused of that once when i was feeling pretty sick. i kept passing out, was dizzy all the time, and just didn't feel right. i also craved ice to the point where i'd get furious if my parents threw it out. we went to this one doctor like 4 times and for some reason she never tested my iron. i heard her talking shit about my mother to a nurse while i was there saying she just wanted attention. i went to another doctor and the first thing she did was test my iron and she said she had never seen iron levels that low. a couple months of taking iron pills and i was completely normal again.
well what else are you gonna do? i always see my cat or animals and they just fucking live their lives. i wonder what they think about, albiet its probably basic as fuck, but maybe we should be less critical and more basic... find something that you don't hate doing and do it a little more (hobby wise).
he just made me cry a little. while taking a poop.
it makes me so sad that i'm a college student and i'm too broke to buy my family gifts this year, shitty hours at work and too much time for classes. i would buy this kid some pirate gear in an instant if not just to make his day.
i didn't really mind mine too much, except that i was laying flat on my stomach, one arm extended (the bit of me that was getting mri'd), the other bent and my chin holding up my head, which got kinda sore. once i got used to that, i think i fell asleep for a bit. but i cannot imagine doing that regularly. my mom did when she had cancer, and her claustrophobia affected her too. fortunately, mine didn't kick in. did you also have some irrational fear that you had metal objects/shards in your body that you didn't know about? for some reason i had the strongest worry about that, even though i knew i never had any metal lodged into my body.
jesus, does the original doctor know that it was iron now, at least? i'm still too petty to imagine not calling up and telling her how wrong she was
this happened to my mom when i was a kid. i have a liver disease and stage five polycystic kidney disease. we went to the hospital because i was having problems, and my mom over heard the doctor in the hallway saying "the kid(i was like 5) is terrified of needles draw more blood to freak him out, and then write her a prescription for anything and send them home." and something about that should shut my mom up.... guess who got fired after they found out my dad worked at that hospital?!
genuine question: what is it about craving ice that is linked to low iron? my sister craved ice when she was pregnant... is that just a crazy hormonal pregnant woman or do you think that is linked to low iron as well?
no, i wish my mom did. i was only 13 at the time so i wasn't going to do it. however, i still feel like i want to call her and shut her up. wish i knew who she was! lol
you've been quoted as saying the iranian nuclear agreement was full of 'holes'. can you be more specific? do you think the treaty should be repealed?
my sister-in-law has cerebral palsy and receives money from the government. she has periods where she is in a lot of physical pain. she would love to get a part time job somewhere that is flexible and understands her needs so that she can get out of the house more. however, if she gets a job of any kind her benefits will be taken away. why would benefits be structured in a way to incentivise people to not join the workforce. why would anyone think this is a good idea and what can be done about it?
hi tim, i'm a representative of district 23 who will be voting in the primaries. how will you address issues of bipartisanship if elected? what issues do you think you can compromise with republicans on?
i understand that you are against tpp what are your thoughts on ttip and tisa?
hi mr. canova, the wolfpac resolution to amend the constitution on the topic of election reform has not yet passed in florida, will you support it?
hi tim. as we know, you are running against dws for her seat in congress, and not her position as the dnc chair. however, if you were made chair of the dnc, what would you try to accomplish?
tim, i am a student currently living in the 23rd district. i feel that because of the notoriety of dws, the needs of the district have not come up as often as i like when discussing politics, because usually the conversation is steered toward national issues. if elected, what are your priorities for our district specifically? as an aside, it truly means a lot to me as a voter severely dissatisfied with dws to see someone accept the daunting challenge of taking her on. i can't remember the last time she had any challenge on the primary level, and what you're doing hasn't gone unnoticed. thank you so much.
hi tim, are there other progressive candidates that you think we should be supporting? thanks for running! just wanted to remind redditors that we are campaigning for tim at the subreddits r/timcanova and r/political_revolution , the later being where we are focusing on many progressive candidates for the long term movement.
what advice would you give those who are making their first step into running for public office, given the recent surge of sanders supporters who are doing just that?
1.) what are your thoughts on the tpp? 2.) in your mind, how does a good trade bill look like?
hi tim, longtime fan, what do you think is the best way to create a real progressive revolution in the us? shifting the democratic party from its current corporate agenda, or the rise of a third party?
dear mr. canova, are you at all concerned by the fact that so much outside money is being poured into your campaign? what is the split between money raised from within the district that you are running in, and money raised by outside donors?
if elected, what will the first things you will do?
what will you do to tackle the over 1.3 trillion dollars americans face in student loan debt?
hello tim. when you were initially deciding to run were you intimidated by your opponent? did your opponents position within the party make you hesitant to run? thank you!
hi tim! have you heard about the leaked dnc files from #guccifer2 and do you have any comment? also, what do you think about whistleblowers like edward snowden?
hi tim, what would you do to change the trend of inaction in the democratic party? the republicans formulated and executed the widespread gerrymandering in 2010 and significantly increased their political power. it feels like the dems just are content to sit on their asses in comparison to the active nature of the republicans.
politics aside, what's your favourite kind of pizza?
if you lose the primary, will you support the democratic nominee in your district?
hi, tim. i saw you saturday at the leadership blue gala in hollywood. i was volunteering there and wanted to say hello, but never got the chance. i wanted to let you know that if i had an "i heart tim" sticker, i would have been wearing it! my question: i know you oppose open borders, but support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. can you expand on your stance and ideas on the issue? do you consider yourself a moderate on this issue compared to your fellow democrats? how does your stance on this contrast with dws?
i was hoping he'd answer this but it seems like he's just ignoring it.
this is the biggest red flag of his campaign. creating a more stable relationship with iran while curtailing their ability to get nuclear weapons is a win win. reversing the deal gets us nothing, and leaves iran with no economic incentive not to pursue nuclear weapons.
my fiance is in the exact same situation but with wilson's disease and other complications stemming from that. there are times where she wants to do something to earn money whether it's an actual job or just freelance work/etsy stuff. she can't. and if she does, she looses support for the 50k+ medication she needs to take to keep her alive.
how does she feel about volunteering? there's a lot of great non profits, animal shelters, veterans centers, retirement homes, or local communities that could use volunteers and would probably be more open to the flexible scheduling.
perhaps this is my cynicism but the idea of compromise see to be missing from both the bernie revolution and the tea party.
i would like to see universal registration, i believe like oregon now has. i have been supportive of score voting and instant runoff voting for many years.
yes, and i believe i answered this in a past ama.
true, i am not running for dnc chair and certainly don't expect to be made chair. what should be done at the dnc? ban corporate lobby donations to the dnc (wasserman schultz had reversed pres. obama's 2008 ban) and get rid of super delegates, many of whom are corporate lobbyists. have the dnc work with all state parties to press them for universal registration and open primaries. and to ensure that the votes cast are the votes counted, real monitoring of the software of voting machines and tabulations. i have heard a rumor that some democrats want to offer the dnc to bernie sanders if he does not get the democratic nomination. perhaps that would help unify the party, i don't know. like many, i am still hoping bernie will get the nomination at the convention next month.
from most of what i've read outside of reddit, dws seems really progressive and decently liked in her district. it seems most of the attacks levied against her have come from outside her district, mostly by angry sanders supporters. hillary won about 72% of the vote in the area. what are the realistic chances of those remaining percentage being able to convince the rest that she's not a good option?
this past saturday at the annual florida democratic caucus meeting, debbie wasserman schultz was asked by carlos calzadilla, a recent high school graduate if she would debate me. she was asked in front of room filled at the labor caucus. i was not there, but from what i was told she had no answer, she was red-faced, bowed her head and scurried back to her seat, and the room then erupted in laughter and applause. she deserves ridicule for ducking debates. i am now hoping to hire carlos as a field organizer! i think anyone who sees wasserman schultz live should ask her the same debate question and they should videotape the exchange. she should have nowhere to hide, perhaps except on the softball chuck todd and rachel maddow interviews!
is there actually a surge? i know bernie urged supporters to do this, and many on reddit responded favorably. just curious if this is a real thing or you're just guessing based on the feedback here?
i am running as a democrat and i am committed to reforming the democratic party. if i win this race, i hope i will be in a position to push for such changes. is this going to be the best way? i don't know. we all know that the election system is unfortunately really stacked against 3rd parties, and that's a big problem.
i wonder if that would help as much as people think. its not very different from voting before an election. candidates with good name recognition and established rapport with voters would quickly outpace new candidates, in terms ofnnetting these vouchers.
no, i am not at all concerned. in the 1st quarter, about 10 percent of our fundraising came from donations within florida. wasserman schultz also raised about two-thirds of her money from outside florida. my donations are an average size of $17. she's taking a lot of money from pacs funded by corporations based outside florida, a lot of delaware chartered corporations. and i had more individual donations in florida than she did!
convene a bipartisan caucus of house and senate members committed to overturning citizens united, committed to publicly financed elections, and unwilling to accept corporate money. i would support the brand new congress in challenging those who refuse to get on board with these reforms.
daiya cheese, black olives and spinach: at least that's what it's been lately!
obama had a weak bargaining position for the aca, so it's not surprise that he couldn't make a better deal. once the republicans made it clear that not a single one of them would vote for it, he needed the vote of every democrat, including those for which it would be political suicide. therefore, he had to make concessions to mollify the more conservative members of his party in an effort to secure their votes. the bill we got is far from perfect, but i don't think a better version of the aca would have made it through congress.
please continue upvoting this comment so that people can stop assuming he has no public opinion on this. this seems very evenhanded and reasonable.
so it took us all of 30 minutes to figure out this guy is just as deflective and unresponsive as every other politician out there. welp that was quick.
i learned at an early age that asking a politician a question is a fools errand. asking a politician a good question is a good way to be ignored, and expecting a good answer is like expecting an addict to give away his stash.
saying something is "full of holes" is not the same as saying it does more harm than good and shouldn't have been attempted. i don't know anything about canova's stance on this though, so i can't speak to that directly.
tim's ideas on iran policy are shaped by his pro-israel stance. in fact, mr. canova has pledged a closer allegiance to the desires of israel's right wing government than dws. i can provide links to quotes and articles if any readers doubt these statements (they can be also be found in the 'down voted to oblivion' section in r/grassrootsselect).
agree. only reddit is dumb enough to believe that they have found a special politician that does not pander or do any other politician things. this clown is riding the bernie train for free.
the amount is around 860$. over a 3 year period if you work more than 8 months earning more than that, your benefits are discontinued and you have to re-apply. source: ticket to work member with long time difficulty regarding above question.
you may not be the person to ask, but i am currently applying for disability-- and i make content on the internet with my free time. i was wondering how things like patreon or online donations factor into the sga? i tried to figure it out on patreon's about section, for example, but it's all in legalese. are they considered gifts or donations? do they affect the sga?
though that is good personal advice, it doesn't address why the system is set up in some odd situations to disincentivize finding a job.
compromise isn't a dirty word to sanders supporters. but you compromise on solutions, not beliefs. bernie is good at compromise, he pushed through lots of amendments in congress with bipartisan support
oregon here. we are not harassed or oppressed and our votes count. i've seen no flaws in our voting system so far. i can't believe every state hasn't adapted to our way of voting.
if bernie was to get the nomination next month despite hillary winning the nomination via primaries, what do you think the larger implications are? how will this affect the democratic party, the general elections, and the foundation of the system as a whole?
why do you hope bernie gets the nomination when he has less pledged delegates? doesn't that go against your opposition to superdelegates?
regarding open primaries, why do you think people who aren't democrats have a right to choose the nominee of the democratic party? i also notice you didn't say anything about caucuses, even though they do more to suppress voters then anything else. without supporting the restriction of caucuses, combined with the pro open primary stance, one could make the claim that you, senator sanders and your supporters are simply attempting to shape the system so it favors the next progressive candidate. that doesn't seem fair to me and other longtime registered dems. what would your response be to that claim?
so you would support the popular vote and pledged delegate vote being overturned and the voice of the people being silenced because you agree with the losing candidate more?
already done. i've already requested my absentee ballot to be sent up to my school for the primary!
a lot of the time people are anti-gmo not because of them being supposedly dangerous but because it gives corporations leverage over small farmers.
i believe the main hindrance to a 3rd party is the electoral college. i also believe this is the main reason why abolishing the electoral college, a mind-numbingly antiquated system, is not talked about more by party elites. if elected, would you support abolishing the electoral college?
how do you believe a caucus of congress members can overturn citizens united and enforce publicly financed only campaigns? my understanding of this issue suggests we need a supreme court who interprets the first amendment differently than the court who decided citizens united or that we would need to change the first amendment.
okay, now politics included, what's your favorite kind of pizza?
or vegan? (whoop, potential vegan rep out there...)
i'm not sure being jewish has to do with anything. either its a good plan or it is not.
what is the god king? is this some insider joke i am not understanding or what is going on?
i mean, we all know the answer: he's in a district with a large and active jewish voting population. he literally cannot have any other position if he would like to be considered a viable candidate.
you didn't really think he was going to answer any substantive questions did you? this is just a fundraising call.c
agreed. i also think it is full of holes, but it was the best option he had. rejecting the deal is akin to saying "it's cool, we'll just invade them in a couple years." i will always choose diplomacy, even if a plan has holes, over worsening tensions.
he's a symptom of how frustrating the sanders campaign has become to people who care about actual progressive reform and change instead of just bernie sanders. dws has not done a great job as the dnc chair, i'll cop to that. she's also on her way out of that position anyway- dnc chairs pretty much never stay for longer than a single cycle. her actual legislative work, however, is reasonable progressive. she is not a moderate in any way, but 2+ milllion dollars of progressive money has been spent on a fruitless primary challenge against her in a district that bernie couldn't even win to begin with. that money could have gone to challenging actual blue dogs or pushing for wins in vacant gop house seats.
what he's doing right now isn't very good either. if anything it damaging. a good chunk this election year has been the rejection of this type of behaviour. either play it straight or don't came to the game.
there are a couple different amounts you are allowed to earn and still get benefits. for 2016 anything above $810 triggers a trial work period. in 60 months you get 9 months where you can try working, earn as much as you want and see how it goes, after you've used those 9 months you can earn no more than $1130 a month in substantial gainful activity (sga) and still get your ssdi. even if you do this for years, if you want to earn more, you can do so under ticket to work's period of extended eligibility. it gives you 36 months, during which time you don't get ssdi if you go above sga, but you don't have to reapply for benefits if any months fall below a certain amount. the monthly thresholds are higher if you are blind. source: i've been working at sga for 8 years and recently went into extended eligibility with a full-time job.
i believe a warhammer youtuber had to stop making videos because she was beginning to earn more than was allowed and would have lost benefits
it's a tricky situation and set up like it is to stop people from taking advantage of working while getting free medical care. it would be really hard to draft laws allowing people on assistance to work to their ability based on their conditions because it really is different from person to person. i think the ideal situation would be universal healthcare from the government so people like ops sister in law would be able to work when they can and still get the benefits they need.
which state are you running in and how do i donate to you?
having a fptp voting system is certainly a flaw. there's always room for improvement!
are you saying tim canova is more high-profile than cory booker?!
like, fundamentally, you can't have expected everyone reading this thread now to have seen the answer in a previous ama... or to trawl through post history. it's not even sassiness; he's just lazy.
i won't speak for anyone but myself, but the hope that bernie could still get the nomination is one in the same as the hope for an fbi indictment will come down on hillary. the implication is then that dispite winning she is unfit to run, nothing more nothing less.
it would be nice if you were running against dws, this guy barely answers and is incredibly vague when he does. i'd have to look over the rest of your views, but at least you know your shit.
i'm glad you are addressing this and i'm sorry that you are being downvoted. if dws was raising 90% of her money out state we would hear so much shit about it... this is a very reasonable question.
these are some weird questions. you really think the 30% vs 10% has a bearing on who will better represent floridians? did you consider that more of wasserman's donations were from corporate pacs?
the pizza question again! anything with daiya cheese!
if he was vegan he would have led with that instead of stating he was running for congress.
debbie wasserman schultz is certainly a viable candidate in fl-23, despite the fact she supported the iran deal.
well christ i figured if he was any good as his job he'd be able to stand up to at least a couple hours of questions from reddit in the middle of a weekday. this is like the cushiest hour to be hosting an ama because all professionals are at work so you don't have too many heavy hitters in the comment section, mostly just college students (who can be tough but are much more agreeable to a progressive like op). frankly the reddit demographic is predisposed to liking him, but between his curt answers, shitty attitude, and blatant ignoring of the tougher questions, he's manage to in short order piss off what should be his cheerleading club. frankly a politicians job entails answering tough questions and effectively navigating the media while seeming personable and identifying with people. the fact he can't do that in a sheltered environment on the internet is embarrassing for him and damaging to his candidacy.
i'm not saying this particular deal is bad, but not all unfavorable deals are better than worsening tensions. see neville chamberlain.
it's sofla. there are certain political realities here. the question is, do we think he is better than debbie on most issues, i think he is.
why not just disable ads while continuing to make the videos? then later on when your ad revenue can overcome your benefits, use that instead.
i agree that's a huge, glaring flaw, but i think he meant there aren't any flaws that only oregon has due to their policy. fptp is garbage, but we have that in the whole country.
it was a yes or no question and he answered, the extra bit there at the end is just a bonus.
which, let's be frank, isn't happening. if something materializes she's getting a pardon faster than nixon.
this site doesn't explain much, could you give more details about this? how many more states need to pass legislation to kill the electoral college?
that is the inevitable end result of countering the bernie sanders circle jerk.
see, my problem with statements like this is my way of refuting them is to say 'grr, annoyed vegan grumble grumble' when that then proves your point... even though the majority of my friends don't even know i'm vegan... grr...
yep, and he's not running to be commander in chief, there is so much good he can do by championing his other positions that his foreign policy stances don't matter as much i'd say. plus, i think dws only voted for the deal in exchange for some favors from obama, so there's basically not much difference between their real positions here.
you can't get a pardon without a conviction and an indictment is a far cry away from a conviction.
in fact, nixon was never even indicted. obama could pardon her right now if he thought she was actually guilty of something- the caveat being that her acceptance of a pardon indicates she was ever guilty to begin with.
and if she accepted that pardon, she wouldn't go to prison, but she'd be the weakest candidate in the history of the united states.
**grandma:** we forget about all this until someone from your generation wants to hear about it and is prompted to ask about it. it's not something you want to drag out and talk to everyone about all the time. if someone were to ask me i wouldn't hesitate to tell them. i'm not ashamed of it. it was shameful for the government. uproot everyone from where they were living. like my dad. i felt so bad that we had to lose our business and build back everything when we came back. but he never lost faith he was always working working working. he helped a lot of people. 2990 people? oh my. i better shut up and go to bed. i guess they would rather hear about it from someone who went through the experience rather than reading about it. i think every generation has some experience that's not a happy one.
**grandma**:did i tell you this one story about how my husband was in north carolina and there was a water fountain that had a sign above it that said "whites only". so my poor husband didn't know what to do so he asked someone. the person said "you're in uniform of course you can get a drink of water" **great aunt**:i know a friend that went to the south. they didn't know what to do because they were sent to came because they were yellow. he didn't know whether to sit in the white section in the front or the black section in the back.
what do you wish that non japanese had done in response to the order?
this is awesome that your grandmother/great aunt are willing to do this. my grandmother and grandfather were also former internment camp incarcerees. i was wondering what their perception was towards the forced internment during the whole ordeal and, now, looking back in retrospect?? after asking my grandmother about these things, it's surprising that she recounts it being a relatively fun time in her life. however, she was still a very little girl, about 6, so all she did was play. she said her older brothers/sisters and parents were much more stressed about it
don't know if you're still here answering but if you are... did your family lose everything and have to rebuild upon leaving the camps, or was there any sort of recompense at all? there were many japanese living in my area prior to internment, many of whom owned homes and farms in the area, however from what i've gathered, none of it was returned. you can look at my high school's old graduating class photos, there were many japanese students at the start of the 40s, then suddenly, there were none at all, i was wondering if this was a common situation for you or people you knew.
how do you feel about actor george takei being a "spokesperson" for those interred? do you think the work he's done has helped in any particular way? what improvements could be made to make the current world more aware of what occurred?
my aunt is talking about how someone she knew was drafted before the war. **great aunt:** after basic training he was released for 2 weeks so he could visit his family. but when he got to the california border they wouldn't let him in because he was japanese. here he was in an army uniform but he wasn't allowed because they were afraid he was the enemy. when he couldn't go to tule lake where his family was, he went to amache. (amache is in colorado). a lot of people from cortland went to amache. my sister went to went to visit him when he came. now i'm not sure how many people this happened to or any of the details, but i know this happened. i wonder if they have statistics about how many people were drafted before the war.
hi! think i'm late... :( i'm from brazil, the country that has the biggest japanese colony. here our grandparents were forbiden to give a japanese name to their children, to teach japanese in schools and other mild things. but an interesting thing happened after the end of the war. part of the community didn't believe in the defeat of japan, they were so nacionalists that they thought that japan was unbeatable and hiroshima and nagasaki was surreal at the time. therefore they thought that the newspapers were lying, and that japan actually won the war. they formed a nacionalist group, called themselves kachigumi (winners), that encourage it's members to kill people that accepted the defeat, the makegumi (defeatist, or dirty hearts). how the japanese community in your country received the news about the defeat? and i wonder if your grandparents still have ties with relatives in japan, here we lost all the connections with the japanese relatives, wich i think is sad.
where were you incarcerated? how old were you when you were released? what types of discrimination did you face when you were released?
doesn't have to do with internment camps per se but how did you and other japanese-americans view japan during the war? were you anti-japan, or maybe even indifferent? did you know anyone who actually supported japan?
what sorts of things did you do to make life "easier" in the concentration camps? do you have any stories of creative things people did to organize events / build community?
i grew up with jewish grandparents who survived the holocaust and life in camps and came to the us when the war ended. it deeply effected the way they raised me and the beliefs they instilled. so, my question is, how much do you think being interned effected the beliefs you held in later life?
di'd you have enough to eat? how were the conditions in the camp? we're they as bad as the german camps?
how strong was the resentment against white people? i assume grudges were held afterwards, but what was the general feeling once you got out?
what did you think of the executive order? did you think it was racist of any sort, or did you think that it was for the "safety" of america at war?
i've recently been to poland and visited some of the concentration and death camps. there we've had heard some testimonials from people who have escaped. have you ever considered escaping, knew someone who did, or heard of people who escaped?
had the president made any public remarks that indicated he was capable of doing this or was it not a surprise? i'm sorry america did this to you, and i'm concerned our current government is capable of doing something similar.
how come this executive order stood and some local judge didnt shoot it down?
my grandma passed away a couple years ago. she was interned in jerome, arkansas. back in a time when segregation was still around, she was treated like whites in terms of privilege. i have a few questions: 1) do your relatives have an animosity towards fdr? i know my grandma resented him. 2) did your relatives lose property? my grandparents used to own farmland in socal, but lost it all when the government came in.
what was the hardest part about reentering society after internment? also, thoughts on the cousins trade?
did you meet anyone new that you kept in touch with? how did you get news about the war from inside the camp?
if you're still answering, as i know this might be late... were you given warning prior to the signing and execution of the order? was it sudden uprooting or a slow and organised ordeal?
do you think internment could happen again? i suppose this time with mexican or muslim americans.
why did you choose to stay in america after the government did such a terrible thing to you for no good reason?
you'll probably never see this comment. my girlfriend is japanese (she was born here in the states) and had some family memebers in the camps and we went to see allegiance (george takei) musical yesterday at the movie theater for a one day special event. it really struck me how bad america treated it's own people just because of skin color and how ignorant we as a country were back then. i'm sorry america did that to you.
this is pretty interesting. seems like japanese americans were also treated better than blacks back then. i'm not 100% sure, but i can't imagine anyone letting a black man drink out of the white only water fountain, even if he was in uniform. anyone else have any insight on this?
great aunt: i don't know. i was 14. i didn't care at the time grandma: haha. you could be like my chinese neighbors that wore a sign that said "i am chinese, not japanese" great aunt: i don't know. i never really thought about that. it's hard to give an answer. when i was older i thought, you know, they shouldn't have done that. but when i was 14 i was very naive and i didn't think about that grandma: i thought it was totally unfair because i am an american
my great aunt is now telling this story about how in camp her husband was drafted, but when he went to get a physical the recruiter rejected him and the 10 other men he was with. the recruiter felt bad that they were being drafted when they were in camp. so her husband came back with the 10 other men that were rejected and everyone was wondering what happened.
my great uncle says it was fun for him too. he lived on a farm far away from anyone japanese. suddenly as a teenager he was surrounded by all these japanese friends and japanese girls his age. he had a blast.
not op, but my family owned land/operated a farm in central california. when they were ordered to leave, many families ended up losing a lot of their farmland. my family was one of the few lucky ones; when they were ordered to leave, my great grandfather's neighbor, a white man, promised to look after their farm and promised to return it when/if they were ever let out. when they finally left, he returned the farm in full.
**great aunt** not when you came out of camp. everyone got around $25 and a bus ticket. i dont remember the exact amount. but it was nothing you could make a living out of. **my younger aunt**:there better not have been anyone. haha. if they did they were in violation of the law.
**grandma**:there's a lot of people who never knew about our situation. a lot of people didn't know about it like my neighbor. whenever i mentioned "camp" she thought i meant summer camp. **great aunt**: that was the guy on star trek right? i noticed him because they finally got an asian guy and i used to watch star trek. i think i saw wevery one in a while in the pacific citizen he would say something. one time he came to the crocker art museum and i was like "oh well there he is" **young aunt:** well they don't know about social media. so if they don't ever use social media they don't know him. **great aunt**:i'm not a gopher. i just want to lean back and let everyone else do the work **grandma**: maybe if i was an advocate of something. but no one is going to listen to me now
good lord. i can't even imagine being told i can't see my family when i'm granted leave. that's honestly one of the most heartbreaking stories i've ever heard of. let your family know, the u.s navy has much higher thoughts of japan and their service to our branch now. and are grateful of the base they graciously allow us to station over there.
my grandparents were interned. my grandmother still has contact with her relatives in japan. both of them can speak and read some japanese, but they never taught it to my mother. in school out here i heard that many japanese in south america were forced to move after the war. apparently they tried to get them to move back to japan, in which many of the japanese had never even been giving that they were born in south america. is this true?
tule lake. well first i went to walerga temporary detention center 18. i didn't because i went right back to japan town. there was no discrimination there. my parents bought a house for me and my sister and they lived in an apartment across the street. [my parents] rented out space in the house for isseis (first generation japanese americans) so they had a place to stay. my mother cooked for them. i think my parents did a good job. i am very proud of what they did.
asking the good questions and no answer... ugh. thanks tho.
**great aunt**: whatever you do when you're 15 or 16. you go to school. we just kind of hung around and i don't know. i'd go over to my friend's place. **grandma:** did you live in the same block? **great aunt:** we met in high school and we lived in separate blocks. during the winter when it was snowing we'd just see each other in school and then go home and do homework. they used to have dances and we used to go. (*granddaughter: lol sorry the answer to this question is so short. we got interrupted by the news that the kings traded away cousins. my family are hardcore kings fans.*)
how could anybody possibly believe they were as bad as german death camps?
if they don't answer, i can say my dad, who was in the camps, felt some resentment. he went back to japan after the war for about 15 years before coming back to the u.s. he would talk about how much they lost. they had a large farm in a nice part of california and the kids were all doing well in school. anyway, there's a lot to it. i'm sure everyone was different but my dad and his brother's definitely felt resentment.
**great aunt**: i don't know. who cares? i'm 14. i don't care. but later on they say that it was political. so you should check into it and see how political it was **grandma**: but it was sure hard on people who had businesses and whatever. sometimes people just disappeared and you didn't know until a few years later. the government would just take them.
**grandma:** i made friends with someone in the camp who was white. she got special permission for me to leave and we went to a restaurant in klamath falls. we waited about an hour and the woman said "this isn't right" and we ordered food and then left. later on after the way i told my husband "lets go to that restaurant and see how they treat us." this was long after the war
he seems to be the kind of people who dont know about the tragedy of abe lincoln the wise.
definitely ask more! there were japanese internment camps in the us, canada, and australia. now, they affected people living in certain areas and not every single person nation wide, so it is possible your family wasn't in one. but i bet she has fascinating stories about it all.
if you are interested there are some good canadian novels about the bc camps and aftermath. joy kogawa's obasan and kerri sakamoto's the electrical field are both excellent
i see and thank you for your comment. your voice has been heard. have a great day!
blacks were never allowed to drink from "whites only" fountains, and the rest of the fountains were labeled as "colored" because this same rule applied to hispanics and native americans. not having seen a japanese person before the locals probably had no idea how to react/classify them so they just said "whateves". source: family that came from the south
how were sentiments from the american chinese and american koreans towards the american japanese?
i can just imagine them stuck in the camp and him being like, 'hey ladies...'
stories like this, lost to the annals of history save for it being passed down as a story of heritage, always make me sad that we will rarely see movies or hear stories about everyday heros like that. it seems so simple but there are so few people out there who will do something that doesn't benefit them at all... just being a good fellow hooman.
my family was interned. they said you were only able to keep a certain amount of money going into the camp, a few thousand. beyond that you had to give up your money, property, and take what you can carry, unless if you had a very trusting non-japanese friend to look after it for you. plus, a couple decades or so ago all japanese people that were interned were entitled to a small compensation... i think it was like $20,000.
wow, so cool that they owned 2 homes so that they could help others! how many first generation japanese americans did your family host? did new people come in as the other ones left (kinda like a typical bed & breakfast), or did they mainly rent it out to just one family for a really long time?
i just find this ama really facisnating. my girlfriend's grandma was also incarcerated for being japanese. she's 90 also lived in japan town... sf? not sure if that's the same one but very interesting.
wow thanks for sharing your family history, that's really enlightening. i can definitely see 2nd and 3rd generation citizens identifying as american. even though they fought against the us i'd probably brag about my uncle or great uncle being a kamikaze pilot. if i put myself in ops grandmas' shoes, and i emigrated from the us to, say, india, i'm not sure that i wouldn't be rooting for america in a global war pitting the two countries against each other. at the very least i'd be remorseful if my birth country lost. on the other hand, it would obviously be advantageous for me personally if indias side won. but then again i would have many friends and family members in america. i'm interested in what others think.
i guess because rounding up your suspicious 'forgein' population is only one step behind rounding up and executing.
i'm fairly certain he's asking about the german interment camps. the ones no one knows about for some reason.
so she was in a camp in oregon? or was this a klamath falls somewhere else?
don't be an idiot and downvote the guy for giving historic information. this helps put a bunch of questions i have had into context. he is in no way saying it is justified. he is just explaining why the us seemingly went crazy out of fear of a whole race of people. something that is very relevant today.
wow that's crazy, i can't believe i've never heard of that incident. thanks a lot for the info man.
i'm confused at these answers. so... some don't think they're similar, but it feels like the anecdotes say otherwise?
this really makes me question the legacy of fdr. he is our hero on the left, but this action by him, to victimize people based on their skin color is just disgusting. weren't we supposed to be fighting hitler for doing the same thing? i'm a huge fan of socialism and the new deal, but this is just too disgusting to handle.
this is 100% fact, my grandmother spent several years in a camp in bc, her family lost everything, so after the war my great grandfather decided to move the family back to japan. so many people dont know about the camps outside of the u.s. the other thing is, my grandmother never really held a grudge about it, it was a terrible experience but she still ended up marrying and american soldier and moving to washington.
just a reminder canada is not as nice as we think! they also had residential schools for the indigenous population up until the early 90's. sad stuff happened at those places.
actually, they weren't always sure how to handle hispanics either. a "mexican" category was added to the us census in 1930, but before that they were legally counted as white. and then roosevelt wanted better relationships with mexico, so he declared that latinos would be considered white again. my grandfather got a full ride to u. alabama in 1950something as an international student from guatemala. he looked more like my kitchen coworker than ted cruz. i'm not sure he ever had enough facial hair to grow a beard. but when he arrived, no one knew what to make of him. it's like what you said- no one knew how to react to him. according to my mom, the fact that he was a foreign student gave him some degree of exemption, and he made up the rest of it by making friend with the entire football team and cheerleading squad. once the football team decided he was white, he could drink from whatever fountain he wanted.
also want to point out that a lot of japanese people, and east asians in general, have very similar skin tone to white people. that probably really confused them.
generally speaking, very little sympathy. lots of fear of misunderstanding. remember, this is 1942. five years after the rape of nanking and *during* japanese imperial control over korea. standing up for fellow americans was one thing, especially when you had few tenuous rights yourself. standing up for people who were directly related to those who were actively slaughtering your family back home was quite another. an easy way to get disowned by your family at home and abroad... then *mistaken* for japanese when government came for round up.
for this exact reason, i interviewed my grandmother - video and audio. it truly fascinates me and keeps me optimistic during these times. plus, it's a memory that will live on for my family and for future generations. it's sad to say that within 5-10 years, most of these stories will be buried forever.
they could still tell us to fuck off now. but they don't, despite the fact that a lot of civilians despise the sailors there.
i, the granddaughter, can answer most of this question. they hosted a lot of single men that would work in the farms and send money to their families. they did this before and after the war. new people came in as other ones left and my grandma and her siblings would cook the food and clean the rooms.
there was a japan town in sacramento and that's where my grandma lived. there's only a couple left - la, sf, san jose, and seattle i believe. after they were evacuated others took over the buildings and many were unable to return to their homes after the war. then governments built freeways and other sorts of projects through the middle of them. after most japanese folks settled in a different area of town, the government decided to build a freeway straight through it.
yeah my grandparents were mildly horrified to find out about that uncle, again they're very patriotic. also back then, it was pretty old fashioned with the whole family association. you know the classic, if you have a "bad seed" in the family then the whole family is bad. so i can see people trying to cover a shame such as a japanese pilot in the family under tight wraps even if no one in the us personally knew him.
i would argue it's many, many steps behind. if germans stopped at the rounding up part it would be a footnote in history instead of the largest tragedy of all time.
i mean the way they saw it back then was an entire race of people were going to war with america, they attacked without provocation or warning, and then the above incident saw that people that were native to that land but living in america aided their former countrymen.
this is the grand daughter here. yeah i know. i was pretty confused. most days my grandma gets it and is pretty mad about the racial profiling (we even went to an anti-islamophobia press conference together). today she didn't seem to remember anything that prompted all the racial profiling of muslims. they were trying to say that they didn't remember why people would be so hateful of muslims. i guess 9/11 and stuff totally slipped their mind.
and they only just apologized about it, as they continue to allow them to live in third world conditions.
japanese were considered "honorary whites" in south africa during apartheid, too. this was more to do with japan being willing to trade with south africa (and buy a lot of s.a. exports) than anything else.
many don't really want to hear these other contexts, it didn't happen in a simple bubble. americans and brits living in japan were put on boats and sent away regardless of their rights or status under japanese law. americans knew about increasing mistreatment of westerners in japan in the 1930's, and the internment of westerners in china, so there was already a lot of fear and animosity.
they could, but it would take a lot of work, given that their constitution says that the us army is their army too.
fair enough i just thought it was a similar thing like germany, part of their surrendering contained a deal allowed certain foreign military bases to be positioned there.
genghis khan killed 10% of the world's population, not defending anything that happened in wwii or saying it's ok....just saying you used the word "largest"
white racialists or white supremacists typically have some respect for the japanese/chinese/koreans because they have high iqs and low crime rates. the arguments they make for black inferiority can't be used against the japanese/chinese because they outperform whites in school etc...if anything, they are seen as at the opposite end of a spectrum to blacks. plus the japanese are light skinned. strictly speaking, white supremacists are kind of north east asian supremacists on the criteria they seem to think are most important...but then they argue that asians are too naturally conformist to have developed the advanced civilisation of the west on their own, or something along those lines, so they find a way back to saying whites are the best lol. just reporting what i've noticed about those ideologies. those impressions and feelings probably go way back.
it's as if these people totally think that the assumed assimilation of asian americans happened without conflict. as if in the past, japanese americans assimilated quietly without being labeled as traitors, or as if chinese americans were not thought of as "stealing our jobs" during the time of the chinese exclusion act. it actively erases the fact that asian americans were once perceived as not assimilating enough and deletes the history of persecution of asian groups in the u.s. then they use asian americans as so called proof that there is a group of non-white americans that "peacefully" assimilated into what they think is american culture.
its only like that because asians as a whole are a fairly small amount of the total population. politicians dont care about anyone that doesnt get them elected, also "asian" as a term is ridiculously broad. the asian population is set to increase by alot, but tht is mostly driven by indian and to a lesser extent chinese immigration. not japanese, korean, thai, etc.
the first part of your comment is really interesting because up in canada it's the complete opposite. the way some people talk, it's like "the chinese" are responsible for all of the ails of this country. there are legitimate concerns about foreign investors who don't live in canada buying up property and letting it sit empty (which is more of a class issue than a race issue) but a concerning number of canadians are content to make blanket statements and blame chinese immigrants for almost everything. this is especially true in vancouver (where i live), which is ironic because we've had chinese people living here almost as long as we've had white people.
there are lots of chinese immigrant trumpists in the u.s., largely because they are racist against other minorities and think trump will put the "bad" minorities in their place and elevate the "good" chinese. there were huge chat groups promoting these ideas during the election. of course, it helps that the chinese government desperately wanted trump because they knew he would be easy to manipulate, and therefore supported him in propaganda.
i don't care what anyone says, as a chinese american working in the financial district of new york city, one of the largest cities with a bunch of asians, the blanket statements are real. i can't imagine how it's like in the boonies (aka anywhere past the holland tunnel /s)
it probably was. the only countries i'm aware of that have ever asked the us to put bases there are south vietnam and south korea. the rest of them are either joint nato bases or from peace treaties as far as i'm aware.
it depends on how you define genocide. if we're talking in terms of pure kill count as an indirect result of government policies, then stalin and mao would be ahead. if we're talking about a concerted effort to kill people, then hitler would win by a long shot.
i like that the all blacks are apparently a prominent topic in nz hs history classes
not the ones at my high school. roughly 13% of my class subscribed to white supremacy views enough to get nazi tattoos. when my mother was debating with one such kid she said, "my son, your classmate of 10 years, is japanese. what would you do if hitler came to power again?" he looked her dead in the eye and said, "i'd kill him".
omggg i get this all the time lol. "what...are you?" "i'm mixed. chamorro/irish" "chamorro? what's that?" "ever heard of guam? it's kind of like hawaii...but...not" "isn't that a fruit drink?" that's a real conversation i've had lmao. it can be really frustrating being mixed sometimes. especially when your "brown" side is something not very common. now where i live depending on the time of year people seem to assume i'm white or mexican.
i think asians assimilated better than white people.
apparently you are all connected to a chinese hive mind that receives directives from china. the british government also told all white americans to drink more tea, because that is how things work.
there's a big difference between the chinese who've been living in canada for that long, who are mostly cantonese, and the more recent immigrants, who are more likely to be mandarin speaking and mainlanders. also i'd definitely attribute the housing bubble in the gta and vancouver area to the chinese population. not even overseas investors; i just moved into a new home and all the neighbors i've met so far are chinese. source: parents immigrated to canada 16 years ago, live in fairly chinese community.
there's a lot of tension between the mainland "chinese" and the older generation that immigrated from hong kong. there's always been an overall disdain for mainland chinese in hong kong culture, but especially in canada, white canadians aren't the only people blaming chinese immigrants. my parents immigrated from hong kong about 30 years ago and blaming problems on the recent influx of mainland immigrants is a common dinner topic.
chinese american here, also interested in this. why would the government of china issue this to people who aren't their citizens??
i agree, i would say most of the first generation chinese i know voted for trump. ironically these people dont think about trump's anti china comments. however as of right now they are kind of vindicated cause you know lower tax and trump has been pretty pro china after the election.
not necessarily. peru, for example has a huge japanese population and even had a former japanese-descended president. they still refer to any non indian asian as chinese.
it happens all the time with my friends as well. unless someone has been raised around or has worked/spent time around asian cultures then the blanket statements are real. even in sf i sometimes see that, but in the south it's on a whole 'nother level. like, "is it true that y'all eat dog?" sorta shit.
actually ive met a lot of asian americans and ive noticed that some of the most racist states towards asians are from "liberal" cities. new jersey, new york, cali are all fairly progressive towards blacks but terribly racist towards asians. aa men at least tend to fair better in the midwest or the south believe it or not. those places just get a bad rep because theyre particularly racist towards blacks
and you think the south during jim crow didn't operate under blanket statements?
people from the caucasus (e.g. chechens) literally are caucasian... not so white, though.
genghis khan (10-15 million killed) and timur the lame (17 million killed) may have bested hitler.
he's/she's forgetting to mention that there were riots involved during the hosting of the south african rugby team, which ended up being a pretty big deal for new zealand politically. the springbok riots if you're interested.
that doesn't even make sense if it's remotely true. japanese were germany's allies. i feel stupid for even pointing this out.
really? i'm not a fan of model minority theory, either, but you realize that asian americans have were segregated through the exclusion act as well, yes? don't go around trivializing other people's experiences to make a cheap point. speak for yourself.
my wife is cambodian-american and i am white. we travel a lot and get a lot of funny interactions. my favorite is traveling in central and south america. i know spanish well and she doesn't know any. but the locals would always come up and talk to her thinking she is from the area because of her skin tone. she would just look at them confused, and then look at me, and i would translate back to her and the local. they would always look at her like she was the stupidest person they ever met. it happened all the time.
europeans didn't assimilate, they conquered and took over.
i'm not 100% positive but i believe it may have been somewhere in tennessee or georgia? i vaguely remember him mentioning they were a few hours outside atlanta though i'm not sure which direction. they were driving from chicago to florida to meet up with some friends and go to disney world so it would have been somewhere along that path.
i, too, would love to know what part of the south, in 2002, had such a thing happen. hell, even knock 30 years off and it sounds ridiculous for my tiny little part of the south.
i just want to note that as a southerner who's made it a point to not be an asshole to people, i'm kind of bummed out about being lumped in with the lot you're describing. guess this is a small sampling of what's it's like to be the target of prejudice. maybe more white people should experience it so they can be more empathetic.
i agree with your comment and the one you're replying to. it's insane to deny that it's impossible to separate race and southern culture/politics/whatever. but it's not *everybody* down there. not that you said it was everybody. you just said often. which could have a ton of definitions, and would ring too creepily true some places, and less true others. i just don't want someone coming to this comment chain and being like "look at these ignorant or horrible liberals" :
didn't the vast majority of native americans die from disease?
this weren't genocides though, they were wars. mao killed many through famine and so did stalin. these aren't concentrated killing of people they are wars
can't edit on mobile. not to be confused with the spring bok-choi riots which is a whole nother issue i won't get into, touchy subject.
i used this argument talking to my trump supporting family while discussing the recent immigrantion issues. they said if the native americans had been smarter they wouldn't have let us. that's some real cognitive dissonance right there.
having grown up in ga, that would have been shocking in 2002. that kind of "we don't serve your kind around here" would have been an out of place relic in the 80's even. most racists would have just grumbled under their breath or make snide comment rather than tried to refuse business. everyone knew that was utterly illegal and more trouble than it was worth by that point. you're talking 50 years after segregation was outlawed and 40 years after the civil rights act. two generations had grown up with that sort of thing being illegal by 2002. so count me as *highly* skeptical. plus people have tv down here too. it's not a third-world country without electricity. people know what an asian person looks like even if they've never met one. (and my 95% white-bread high school had about a dozen students from east & south asia.)
it definitely happens. i was staying in the flatonia, tx area for training five years ago. my trainer told me point blank she was shunned for talking to the hispanics working at her plant. "you can pass for white, so you should be ok" she told me. my husband couldn't pass for white, and shit got really dicey because we looked like an interracial couple. if looks could kill... eventually the cleaning staff explained it would probably be better if we stayed in the hotel rather than explore the town. i grew up in san antonio. it blew my damn mind that there was a town less than three hours away where this shit happens. where i work it still happens. i've had people up and quit when they found out a black man was going to be working with us. people astound me.

are you concerned about the trump administration's positions on net neutrality and surveillance?
who runs your twitter account? and why was it so blatantly partisan during the election? you guys were tweeting insults about bill clinton, conspiracy theories with no proof, and other things that had absolutely nothing to do with leaks. i used to really appreciate the role wikileaks played in opening governments, but your organization has completely lost all credibility as far as i'm concerned.
why have you been silent about assange's situation at the embassay?
you, obviously, have access to all your own internal communications, such as emails. why not publish those in the name of transparency? alternatively, if someone hacked into your own accounts, stole all your communications, and "leaked" them back to you, would you publish them then? basically, "quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" ("who watches the watchmen?")
are there any things that you wouldn't condone leaking? anything that has come in that was just too much of a risk, or would have too much impact on something?
how did you decide timing of #podestaemails and how to groups emails into parts?
i feel something that needs to be addressed is this: if wikileaks truly wanted what's best for america, why not release all sensitive information well in advance, to give the american population time to respond sensibly and soberly to leaked information? the timing of the leaks caused a lot of fear and uncertainty. by timing leaks so close to the election, the logical implication is that wikileaks explicitly wanted donald trump to win the election. what makes you think it's acceptable for one organization to try to determine the outcome of a national election in this way? how do you defend the ethics of this? transparency is an incredibly valuable thing for democracy and i commend that element of your efforts, but knee-jerk reaction is ridiculously dangerous. (edit for typos)
why wasn't the dnc corruption, or any of hillary's corruption scandals released; you know, when bernie was still in the race?
what was the deal with releasing the encrypted files just a few days ago?
how much information comes from sources wikileaks is aware of vs. those that are anonymous?
what inspired you to upload encrypted future wl publications on tuesday?
cybersecurity firms have identified that the sources of your intelligence, notably the podesta emails, have likely included russian hacking groups. when publishing documents from such sources that are likely to withhold specific documents, how do you ensure that what you're leaking shows the entirety of a collection and not just those documents that tell a particular narrative?
recently you published a tweet that linked directly to a post on r/the_donald - do you think there is any issue in aligning yourself with such a partisan sub?
stats on the ddos attacks? what are plans to mitigate the attacks?
i think a lot of your recent actions have made people jaded and have made them believe you are a partisan organization. personally, i appreciate the transparency you gave to the presidential race even though candidate i preferred lost. with that said, we've heard in the past that you have leaks on donald trump. will you release this information to the american public just as you did with hillary clinton? the public deserves to know in the exact same way they deserved to know about clinton.
is reddit on to something with the child sex trafficking?
assuming this is the proof for the key on julian dead man switch after they cut off his iternet.. is he alive? i'm scrolling g through thread now for proof of life.
notorious conspiracy theorist is proven wrong again. more news at 10.
we are concerned about anyone that gets access to the mass spying system the us has built. we will be happy to publish any documents on changes/abuses/policy changes on these topics and others from the trump administration.
yep trump is going to crush net neutrality. are you guys still going to support him if he doesn't grant assange amnesty?
i assumed they thought the reddit darlings would be totally on their side and not call them out on their shit.
this really needs more attention. wikileaks' information has always proven to be genuine, but the nonsense posted to their twitter account makes it quite clear that the leaks are being curated to push an agenda.
exactly. their ama has been a train wreck and a complete disappointment...not answering anything they don't want to and certainly not being transparent. as for the election they could've done much more; they could have released damaging info on trump as well and probably brought both parties to their knees.
this is a really good point. i truly want wikileaks as a resource, and i do value it. however, in order for wikileaks to have legitimacy in the broader mainstream public and for us, your hesitant supporters, to be able to tout you as a legitimate resource, these concerns need to be addressed. i would hope wikileaks would agree with me that no one is above criticism, even wikileaks.
it's hard to fathom they weren't able to obtain his full income tax returns considering his social security number was publicly leaked.
this question is most interesting to me. why has wikileaks' social media been so silent, letting people go days and weeks speculating whether or not assange was dead or alive, when a simple tweet could have quelled everything?
we at the team are monitoring his situation very closely. it is of course highly concerning that his internet is still severed without explanation. he has over the period occasionally been able to do interviews in person or over the phone which showed publicly he was still alive. generally the staff, except a couple that have a public profile do not speak publicly. there are obvious security risks for the team (a us secret grand jury still continues to this day), however, we have at this moment decided to do this ama as a team to answer questions at this difficult time when we are very aware that our editor's communications situation is tricky.
they aren't going to answer this, snowden was right. they've become politicized and julian has his own agenda. in fact, many people forget that many of his anonymous supporters left him because he want them to do his bidding
some of that will leak the source. so it will have to be edited. then once it's edited, how can you trust it? but good question.
we have an editorial policy to publish only information that we have validated as true and that is important to the political, diplomatic or historical. we believe in transparency for the powerful and privacy for the rest. we publish in full in an uncensored and uncensorable fashion. we have had to, and will have to, take risks ourselves (the secret grand jury that began due to our 2010 publications continues to this day) in a number of the publications we do. but we are not risk adverse and will continue to publish fearlessly.
bystander here. does anyone know why the leaks were released in batches throughout the course of the election? to me that was the part that seemed partisan, but is there a reason for chopping them up i don't understand?
those are insurance files for next leaks. if assange dies, dead man's swich will activate and relase private keys to decipher insurance files. and truth would be still leaked...
people aren't going to read this dude, where is the tl;dr!
our submissions system is based on the concept of sources being as anonymous and protected as possible. we dont want to know who our sources are for their protection, and ours.
the encrypted files we released a few days ago are insurance files. we have done this before. insurance files are encrypted copies of unpublished documents submitted to us. we do this periodically, and especially at moments of high pressure on us, to ensure the documents can not be lost and history preserved. you will not be able to see the contents of any of our insurance files, until and unless the we are in a position where we must release the key. but you can download them and help spread them to ensure their safe keeping. to download them you will need a torrent client (like transmission or utorrent for example).
it is curious. so far we dont know what to make of it.
additionally, why did they start publishing documents whenever they feel they can impact the elections the most instead of publishing them as soon as they were ready for release like before? honestly, it's hard to believe they're not a partisan organization anymore. but this thread is going to be brigaded by the_donald in like 10 minutes so i'm not sure why i'm even posting.
hasn't trump expressed interest in executing snowden? or imprisoning him?
this meandering post is non-responsive to the point at issue - which is about wikileaks's failure to remove personally sensitive material from its submissions, like social security numbers. the public doesn't have a right this private, sensitive information any more than it has a right to your bank account information
this ama is a total farce. wikileaks has lost all credibility. it's basically the "headline news" to rt's cnn. it used to be legit, but russia got it's mitts on them, so now assange's stooges do the work of the kremlin.
it would need to be submitted. they don't actively hack or persue.
because they want people to talk about wikileaks. if they confirmed that assange was fine and just playing skyrim se or something, they'd lose some publicity
yup and as far as i can tell they're ignoring all of them
what is this "dead man switch"? some heart sensor connected to ifttt? if assange(0) instruct gmail to email all passkey?
it'd take them a week to untangle this mess of accusations.
how much does that individual play into op's theory?
i understand where you are coming from. at the same time i think its fucked up that you have some sort of information that must be so very important and you withhold it. how does that not go against your group's purpose?
no its important, the leaks were definetley viewed as assange vs hillary by a lot of many americans and most agree they had a some if not a large impact on the election. this can easily be construed as partisan in many eyes, especially since the leaks were almost all one sided, and things like trumps tax return stayed hidden and his financial ties around the world relatively ignored. did assange just want to throw a grenade into the whole process? because that's what it feels like to a lot of us. also if you get your leaks from russian hacks, aren't you just playing into russias schemes while they can use you as a middle man/scapegoat?
if this question gets answered i will eat a small hat shaped food item.
i'm more concerned about myself, as a non-significant citizen, who has never been employed by the government - if someone leaked to you government records containing my phone-calls/emails/browsing-history/tax-returns - would you publish or censor?
i wonder if assange and the team would be comfortable with their social security numbers and other sensitive information hitting the web. can we find this anywhere? has it been leaked already?
the balance of power --has prevented world war for awhile now, yet it looks like they are intimidated by china and russia and do not release information on those countries which have even less transparency. beware the law of unintended consequences--unless you are looking for war to no longer be contained and to(edit) spread world wide--again.
a mouthpiece of the russian government has intervened in the american election to help sway the outcome towards their preferred candidate and the republicans could not be happier about it. so many words i never thought i'd say.
all credibility. i couldn't agree more. what a shame, i believed in them. another good idea run by people too easily corrupted by power. weak move, wikileaks.
yeah, such scumbags. even if you pretend they are investigative journalists they lose all credibility when they bow to sources desires to release documents at moments of the highest impact. unbiased journalists shouldn't care about *when* the impact happens.
damn it! if only there was a way i could get locked in a building and play skyrim 24/7 with no responsibilities.
this is a bad attempt at pr for them. they figured /t_d would support them fully but they didn't realize there would be real questions asked from both sides. they also don't tell us anything about where they, personally draw the lines. i'm sure they're good people who feel like they're doing right - but there's too many questions/not enough will for them to answee
we are not withholding that information. we publish as fast as we can. the insurance files contain the publications we are working on, as soon as they are ready we will publish them. however, we are under many attacks at this moment and so, to ensure they are not lost, whatever happens to us, we put out these insurance files.
whoa, they actually paid attention and then reacted in one of the most "caught red handed" ways possible.
holy fuck i live less than a block away from comet and this whole thing is such bullshit hahahahaha. comet is not a dodgy place, it's a fucking pizza/ping pong joint that everyone from my neighborhood goes to. and if you think weird murals in restaurants is odd, you obviously haven't been to many hipster dc restaurants.
syn requests are part of a connection handshake. the hackers extend their hands ("syn"), the server extends its hand back ("syn-ack"), but then the hackers never start shaking ("ack"). so the server is left waiting for the shaking to start, occupying a communication port and tying up resources. this only ends when the server gives up. in the meantime, while the server is waiting, the hackers can withdraw their hand and make many more handshake attempts just like the first one.
they would publish it. absolutely. they say over and over they do not censor
i'd like to see their email correspondence. what are they hiding? or would it simply be embarrassing?
what the fuck did i just watch. this is some crazy shit. jesus christ.
is this how cloudflare and the like work? they are able to better handle the multi handshakes?
this is so true it's amazing. they think it's acceptable to lay bare the guts of an organisation, where the hell is the transparency for wikileaks? if they don't have an agenda and aren't doing anything dodgy or lying let's see their e-mail correspondence.
i don't remember the whole thing, but the podesta emails are legit because you cant forge google emails. something like that.
something something child eating pedophile elites using ping pong/comet pizza as fronts. not gonna lie, as a casual observer there are some odd usages of some select phrases.
some things that look suspiciously like a child sex ring. no proof yet.
small footnote on his comment: syn ack stands for synchronize acknowledgement. so the hacker is synchronizing with the server, and server is waiting for acknowledgement of the connection but never gets it.
and what's even worse: the syn packet contains the sender's ip. but if you never actually want the connection established, you can write any address in there, and the server will send syn-ack there. so you can't even find out where the traffic is coming from, unless you control the network.
is this a financial attack because of server costs? i never considered that.
they're clearly using code language for something. "should i play dominoes on pizza or pasta?" "a map was left on a handkerchief, possibly pizza related" "missing you and your hot dog stand" the only question is what else could they possibly be talking about? coke parties? call girls?
did you enjoy filming ghost world? what do you think of the ending, is it open ended or is there a definite answer? p.s. i love you
mr. buscemi, have you seen the fx series fargo, and if yes, what did you think of it compared to the original movie?
thanks for doing this. what question were you hoping would be asked but wasn't?
hello, mr. buscemi! huge fan of yours. what are some of your favorite albums?
greetings! favorite memory working with tarantino? thanks!
hi steve! you're in so many great movies that if i'm surfing the channels and one of them is on, i have to stop and watch. (fargo, billy madison, con air, etc.) what are some movies that you have to stop and watch every time they're on?
i loved trees lounge! do you think you'll ever get back into writing? or maybe especially writing / directing / starring?
which pizza topping is better: french fries and oreos or peanut butter and gumballs?
if you could time travel which decade would you choose and why?
steve, i'm a huge fan.. i absolutely loved you in boardwalk empire. so what's your favorite boardwalk food?
mr. buscemi, i greatly appreciate you taking the time to do this ama. what role have you passed up and later regretted not accepting? top 3 favorite books?
hi steve, what's your favorite pastime? say you had nothing to do and no obligations, what would you do?
how many cups of coffee would i need to give you before you tip me?
i think its absolutely amazing you used to be a firefighter and i love reading about the support you've shown to fire services across america (the photo of you volunteering after 9/11 is one of the best things i've ever seen) my question is what made you decide to be an actor?
what's the weirdest pronunciation you have heard for your last name?
hi steve! which melody do you hum to keep yourself calm?
hello steve!? my question to you is, do you like soup?
steve, if you were locked in a vending machine, what would be the first snack you'd eat?
hi steve, i was just wondering what would you consider to be your spirit animal?
how did you get involved in this documentary project?
how do you do fellow kid? what is the weirdest thing you have heard about nicholas cage?
steve, is there a place in the world you would love to visit and haven't yet?
if it was your last day on earth and you were making a sandwich, what would be in it?
hey steve. i enjoy your acting. have you ever been on reddit before? what do you think of it so far? are you a big web surfer at all? any memes you love or hate?
steve your awesome! what's your favorite film you've done with adam sandler?
what, in your opinion is the funniest movie you've been part of?
do you read philosophy? if so who is your favorite philosopher and why?
i have not seen the tv show fargo. but i hear wonderful things about it. i do hope to watch it... someday! someday i hope to watch a lot of shows, haha, that i don't seem to see.
you know, we used to go bowling together, and yeah, i'd say john. john was better. i think he's just a better athlete in general.
well - maybe people will realize by now that i don't feel very comfortable doing these things, so i guess i don't put a lot of thought into - to be honest, i'd rather not be answering any questions. i guess if i *had* to think of a question - um... you can put "long pause here" - i don't really have one.
um... i love elvis costello, and i think one album that i go back to of his is "get happy." but he's done a lot of amazing work over the years. same thing with tom waits. you know... "mule variations" is an incredible album, as is all of his work. i'll always go back to "abbey road," even though i haven't listened to it fully in years.
oh no! um... hahaha... well, *this* is certainly not my element. i like being outside, sometimes? i don't really have one element. i tend to adapt. i like to work. i'm not one of those actors who... you know, has to do a play every year. so i wouldn't say the stage is necessarily my element. yeah, i like being outside, haha!
just his enthusiasm, you know? he was so excited to be making a film. and... to be directing his first film. in rehearsals, the rehearsals were just as exciting as the filmmaking! he would set up - this whole improvisation of us robbing the jewelry store, so that we would improvise and act out what went wrong. he just had, you know, has a lot of joy, in him! and it was - it made all of us also feel like we were working on our first film.
um... goodfellas is one that i always stop and watch. just recently i was... watching tv with my brother, and we came across casino, and we had to watch that. pretty much... any scorsese movie, haha, i think i would stop and watch! and then a movie that i've always loved but i hadn't seen it in years because i'd watched it so many times that i didn't know if i could watch it any more is it's a wonderful life. also... let me see... fat city, with jeff bridges and susan tyrell... any john cassavettes film...
yeah, trees lounge was something that - took everything out of me! i so wanted to write something, and direct something, and write something that i could be in... but i never necessarily saw myself as a writer or a director. i had been doing work with a good friend of mine, the actor mark boon, jr. - he plays the character of bobby on sons of anarchy - and we used to do a lot of theater together, throughout the 1980's on the lower east side and in the east village - and so we always created our own work, and that's what i was trying to do with the film, too. you know. to write a part for myself, for boon, for my brother michael who's a wonderful actor, and for friends of mine, like rockets redglare, who's a wonderful comedian and actor... so... i've continued to direct sometimes, and sometimes i have a hand in some of the things i've directed in, in the writing, but yeah! maybe in the future.
um... well, i'm kinda curious what happened to garland greene? i guess if he got on another plane, haha, that could be a con air 2. sure! i had a lot of fun making that film. and i thought it was a great cast, and i thought jerry bruckheimer and simon west put together a really great cast, and it was fun to hang out in the desert with all of them. so yeah!
well, uh, for all the deeds fans out there... french fries and oreos, definitely.
as far as roles go, i don't tend to hold onto that stuff. if i passed on anything, i think it was for the right reason. top 3 favorite books... yeah, you know, there's this book called you can't win by jack black (but it's not the jack black that we know of today - this was a guy at the turn of the century, who used to ride the rails, and led the hobo life, and wrote about it as a cautionary tale - he drank too much, he did too many drugs - but it's hard not to read that book and not want to live the life that he led! it's a book that really inspired william burroughs, and actually, he had two books i really love - he's got a lot of books - but i really loved his books junkie and queer). junkie really describes the life that william s. burroughs lived in new york - his life of, i guess he was writing about the 1940's, and then queer is when he lived in mexico city, and jack kerouac's on the road has always been a favorite too.
superman. that was one of the shows i loved as a kid, too. although i loved the batman series as well. but superman is definitely the one i remember first. there was nothing like the excitement of that show coming on tv, when i was a kid. and i did have a superman outfit - a costume that i got for - i believe my 5th birthday. and on the cape, of the costume, it was printed - i forget how it was worded, let me see - it was something like "you cannot really fly while wearing this outfit." but then it said "only the **real** superman can fly." i swear to you. that's what it said. **only the real superman can fly.** i really did believe in superman.
i would tip you after one cup of coffee. if you're nice.
wow, til steve buscemi used to be a firefighter on 9/11. i'm going to go make a til post about it.
the weirdest one? um... i dunno. sometimes people will say "bushoomi" or if they pronounce the c as a hard c - i guess it's hard to describe in print - like "booo-stemmi."
my spirit animal. so tell me what a spirit animal is? *yeah.* maybe my spirit animal is - a - monkey.
i don't think he's weird at all. i think he is who he is. and i'd love to do con air 2 with him.
well... where would i go? i don't know. i don't think about traveling that much. one of the most beautiful places that i've been to, though, was sicily, and i'd like to get back there someday. *where would i go?* maybe south america. i've never been there.
you know, i have to be honest. it's these questions that make me nervous. i don't know why! i think it's a very personal thing to ask! you can say that: i'm kidding. but yeah, i don't know why these questions make me nervous. hahaha! but they do!
well, i'm very partial to billy madison, because that was one of the first films that adam did on his own, as part of his production company. and the film that we did before that was called airheads, which was directed by michael lehman, and that was the film adam and i met on, where we played brothers in the band, "the lone rangers"... and i always have a great time working with adam. i loved the character i played in the wedding singer. i just worked with him again on the western that he's shooting now called the ridiculous six. but yeah, i would say... i don't know if i have a favorite, but i really do love the character in billy madison.
it's very good but i feel like nucky thompson would have fixed all of the problems there quickly.
trees lounge........just a great great movie. i love that movie.
he called you in for the *sit down*. david chase is such a gangster
did john oliver request you to show up as a cameo on one of his episodes, or did you make the request? your appearance was so random on last week tonight.
is this the advice? because if it is error error error
til that tarantino made them do the robbery scene even if its the one thing we don't see in the movie... interesting.
it's funny that you describe "fargo" as commercial, because on this side of time, it's more obscure than the big lebowski, while "the dude" has been plastered all over merch and purchased by people who've never even seen the movie. that said, i think i liked fargo better as a movie (but you kind of have to have lived in the midwest to truly appreciate it, i think).
well he tips if the waitress does something extra like fill his cup of coffe at least six times.
i have recently discovered that i will stop and watch goodfellas even if there's no sound.
heh, brit here, literally all we remember about your performance in con air was your amazing caricature as a pedo. you nailed it. feel free to join our political parties.... edit - didn't mean that as a slight, love your work, and thanks for the boggly eyes and the cross-atlantic entertainment. there are not many people that can do that. edit again - i'm a brit, and i thought that guy was the best actor in conair. despite cage... edit thrice - cheers mate, from all of the uk.
if you tell yourself you're the real superman, you can fly too.
what's nice? take you in the back and suck your dick?
did you ever feel like you had a look that was too distinct to be an actor? i think its a huge asset, but do you feel that way? did you always?
would you mind if i repost your post about it in a few hours?
hah, the john goodman hotel story reminds me of the scene from barton fink. did he give you a present and tell you not to open it?
i would so watch con air 2. you sir are one of my favorite actors, period. your character is just legendary. i always love what you bring to the table each time. thank you for being you.
sounds like you're on the fence about the cheerios.
i really enjoyed that character too even though i felt so sad for him.
hm...how so? i don't understand why her death would be the only resolution. mind 'splaining?
quickly? no way. he would ignore them and let them fester over the course of a season, showing annoyance instead of decisiveness. at the end, when forced to act, he'd come away with a partial victory.
i completely forgot about that movie! must watch again soon.
you've been waiting for this moment. i'm happy you're here.
your entire post history is walter quotes. that is fantastic. smokey this is not 'nam this is bowling, there are rules!
take mr. buscemi's advice: don't take mr. buscemi's advice.
actually, without hindsight neither is really all that commercial.
fargo was pretty big when it came out. i don't know how commercially successful it was, but i remember hearing about it a lot at the time.
no need for sound. i could overdub that movie. terribly, but i could do it.
aol makes 500 million a year off dialup believe it or not
steve may get onto me for misquoting here, but i remember something about multiple orthodontists offering to fix his teeth and him saying that if they fixed his teeth he'd never be able to act again. not sure if that answers your question but i figured i'd throw it out there.
he was happy at the end though, so it's all good :)
the old man basically says he's waiting for death. eventually, the bus shows up and takes him away. there are no other passengers on the bus. it isn't on a schedule, labeled in any way, and doesn't indicate that it is going anywhere. she then takes the same path he does. she doesn't have to wait for the bus, it comes to her exactly when she wants it, implying, to me, that she caused her own death. she also did all the tell tale things that people do before they commit suicide, like giving her things away, and forgiving everyone. there are other more subtle clues, such as the bench image that i posted that says, "life, not in service". at some point in the movie, she says, "if so and so happens, i'll kill myself" and that thing happens. she sort of said it jokingly, but i remember it having a weird vibe. i remember there being other things, but i haven't watched the movie in a few years. i'm definitely going to go back and watch it again soon.
his comment really pulled the thread together man.
dude's been on reddit for seven years and just doubled his total comment karma an hour ago.
/u/walter_sobchak is a truly dedicated servant of reddit.
i mean fargo is at heart a traditional great drama film that appeals to adult audiences.
is that movie good? i love simon pegg but i haven't heard much about that movie.
this must have gotten a lot more upvotes than when you were first here. 3847/3513 = .91 /u/walter_sobchak has gotten 91% of his cumulative upvotes from this single comment. he didn't double it. he decupled it.
how does he "nail it" i'm from california so if you could break it down a bit i'd really appreciate it.
yeah, but it's so understated that it's on a parallel with comedy but what really makes it a masterpiece is that because of that understated drama and understated comedy it somehow borders on the absurd.
i enjoyed it, but it wasn't like shaun of the dead or anything.
i always assumed he was just deciding whether to kill her. maybe we each see ourselves in his actions?
my brain is just not firing on all (whatever number it's supposed to be) cylinders today. i meant hearing impaired but i'm gonna leave that mistake up.
no, man, you got the wrong guy, i'm the dude. or his dudeness, or el duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.
i don't think much will ever be like shaun of the dead.
i thought it was supposed to be implied that her innocence cures him.
this is the correct answer. it was a redemption story, i don't know wtf these people are thinking.
that's what i thought, however it clearly wasn't well done if the general consensus was that he was gonna do stuff to her
if it feels the need to tell you on the package that it is "flushable" then do not flush it. toilet paper and human waste are the only things you should flush down your toilet
every trade is looking for apprentices my advice to you is stick with it. one day you will be certified and it will pay off. learn as much as you can and try to take over the job. tell your boss to get out of your way and tell you how to do it. as an apprentice if you can keep your boss from touching his tools you are doing an excellent job
when you say 90% of calls are simple things, are these things we homeowners could do without many specialized tools?
hey so the sink in my bathroom smells like sulfer farts. i get that the trap is probably full of all sorts of disgusting organic matter just rotting away. hair, gunk, etc. problem is my sink is sitting atop a 'pedastal' free standing very close to the wall. i don't think i can get to the trap to clean it out. what do i do? additional question: how do i make my water hotter in the shower. i have on demand hot water. do i adjust that device? or allow the shower knob to open further?
you're a saint for doing this. i have a shower handle that has a hex nut that keeps unscrewing, and the handle keeps falling off. should i use a locking agent on the hex nut, or will that lead to more problems later on?
hi, i work hvac/plumbing administration. wanted to ask you a question unrelated to minor plumbing needs. we've been noticing that there is a growing age gap amongst plumbers in our state (maine) with the average age of plumbers being in their 40s-50s. do you find that you have the same experience?
liquid "plumber" and other chemicals. effective or not worth the damage to the pipes?
im 20 years old and in college, but am considering going into the trades. im considering plumbing as well as a few others, but am wondering what the industry looks like right now for someone my age?
i bought a house recently, and the master bath does not output any hotwater. if i move the lever to the hot side the water will just stop running, and conversely getting stronger the closer i get to full cold. also, i don't seem to have a shutoff valve anywhere for the master bath- is that common?
is there a special way to determine where pipes are creaking from hot water expansion? and if i find them what type of brackets should i use to secure them? anytime i turn on the hot water you can hear creaking in the wall but it's really hard to pinpoint exactly where.
what's the most disgusting thing you had to do in your line of work?
a few days ago, i accidentally flushed a plastic fork. i haven't had any issues so far, but should i be worried? should i report it to building maintenance or something?
is the day after thanksgiving really called "brown friday" in your profession, due to a large number of calls for plugged up toilets?
i recently re-floored my upstairs bathroom with vinyl locking tile. i slightly lifted my toilet just enough to slide the tiles under(very slight). ever since then, i've been hearing this back up sound through my pipes and to my sump every once and a while. did i possibly break something while elevating the toilet? it sounds like a gurgling sound about twice a day.
my house used to be a duplex so we have two of everything. the water upstairs has stopped working but i'm having trouble finding where the lines leading upstairs are. what's the best way to trace it without tearing walls apart. and what could be the cause?.
how do you know when you need a new toilet? my toilet takes 2 or 3 attempts to flush *any*thing. it also randomly makes a running water sound, a few times an hour. my wife blames me.
i am also a water and sewer treatment operator with 10 years experience in this industry, and 5 years in plumbing before that, mind if i chip in?
my bathrooms shower/tub faucet drips constantly at a steady drop or two every 3 seconds, what can i do to fix it?
have you ever had people invite you to join their holiday parties, meals if you're over fixing their toilets/sinks?
the plastic drain pipe underneath my sink have a leak. they have the plastic fitters on the joints that hand tighten. i've tried a few different times fixing it but it still leaks. should it be replaced?
my dishwasher often has ponding water in the bottom. what do you suggest? thank you for this, not enough people realize how important clean water is to society. i mean it's taken for granted. edit* thanks for all the great answers!
how much do you hate diy electricians? met any live plumbing yet?
does this sound serious? a week ago we noticed that there was a leak from the upstairs glass shower. in the room below it on the ceiling there is a brown water spot, that has been getting bigger. it goes away if we don't use the shower. it seems to be from the drain in the shower, because if we just don't use the shower and throw water down the drain(from another source) the spot appears again. is this something that would require us to take out the ceiling?
my wife wants to replace the tub faucet and knobs before our newborn arrives. i've never done that before. is it something simple to screw on (as she claims), or is there more advanced plumbing that will have to be done?
i keep hearing conflicting information, but are bathroom wipes safe for pipes or should i use toilet paper still?
what's the weirdest reason for a call you've ever had?
have you ever had a "porn scene" unfold in front of you and actually gone through with it? very interesting ama, thank you!
when changing solenoids in the old american standard urinals that had the solenoid in the top of it, how do you keep the o-rings in the female couplings when putting the pipes back together?
anytime we turn on the faucet in the tub, half of the water immediately goes up to the shower head. what would cause that?
my toilet rocks a little. i'm thinking i'm using the wrong wax ring (has a black plastic piece in the middle) if i swap out that and replace with a wax only one do you think that will solve my issue?
i have a bathroom in my basement where all the drains go into an ejector pit. sometimes when the pump goes on and shoots the water out to my septic i get a sewage smell in my upstairs bathroom. we just had the septic pumped out earlier this year. any ideas on why this is happening? the smell only seems to come when the ejector gets used a lot in a short time.
what is your opinion on air admittance valves? i know a lot of plumbers are against them, but i really don't want to cut a hole in my roof for a proper stack.
does semen actually clog drains up or is that all a hoax? asking for a friend.
when i turn on the shower and set it for hot water, only a little bit of water comes out. our handyman thinks that it's just the showerhead that's clogged, but if i set it all the way to cold, it flows majestically. i now have to choose between hot water and flow rate, so i end up taking lukewarm showers at best. i fear i have to replace the actual plumbing lines behind the wall as the house is old (built in the 50s). what do you think?
i don't know why this is so below. this should be engraved on every toilet. flushable means "yeah it can go down the water hole" but it also means "we can't assure you it will deintegrate into smaller pieces so it will eventually clog your pipes if you flush this too often" and it's a pain in the arse for water treatment plants. piece of advice for those who doesn't know this yet: condoms shouldn't be flushed. listen to the plumber: toilet paper and human waste
sorry if you've covered this elsewhere, but if i do not yet have clogging (from grease or otjerwise) but suspect that i may in the near future, what can i pre-emptively to clear it?
i discard liquid food in the wc drain, shouldn't i? have never had a problem.
to expand on that; i teach at our local apprenticeship school, if we could find guys/girls that have a good attitude and the willingness to learn that would make my job so much easier. i teach skills that no one can ever take away. sit in class, appreciate that someone is taking their time to teach you how to do this work, and be prepared to take the reigns and prove that you want to do this work. i don't know what scale is where you're at, but it's good money to be made and benefits on top in most places.
the anode rod in the heater is bad. it can be pulled out and cut off to fix the problem but i recommend calling someone to do it as it can cause problems and you need special tools for it
define shower handle. i'm assuming you have a store bought hand held shower head. and it doesn't swivel properly so when you shift it to wash yourself the supply line comes loose. buy a better quality head
im 34 and my helper is 30. i started plumbing when i was 19, i don't see any young helpers anymore. kids are not getting into this line of work
maine has this issue state wide sadly. our young workers take better wages in other states more often than they stay.
you just described the appliance repair trade. i think this is similar for most trades in fact. one of the main reasons mike rowe (dirty jobs) keeps pushing folks to go into trade school, rather than college.
ive been plumbing since i was 18. im 26. not a single person ive worked with otherwise has been under 35. most of them are 50+
absolutely the worst thing you can do to a drain line
as long as people are alive we will need plumbing. it's not a trade that will go anywhere. it pays quite well and we need young blood
remove the trim of the faucet. the circular disk that is right against the wall hides the shut off valves. sounds like they didn't open the hot side. it'll be a flat head screw
that's because they didn't drill a hole big enough. the only way to stop it is to find the tight fit cut the pipe out and make a bigger hole. you're 100% right that it's expansion. probably sounds like water dripping in the wall. cheapest route is to just deal with it. it won't cause any problems
i had to lay an extension ladder on the ground above a sewage leak under a house and crawl on top of the ladder to keep myself out of the sewer and fix the leak
yes. the fork may not have made it out of the toilet. take a big wad of toilet paper and flush it. if the toilet stops up the fork is stuck in the toilet and will continue to cause problems. if you are able to flush multiple wads of toilet paper i wouldn't worry
i've never heard of the water just not working. sounds like there's debris in the stop valves. take them off and clean them out
yea, many times. have been called out to a party then asked to stay
i'm not a plumber but a contractor that goes into people's homes on average of four times a week. it's very awesome how often people ask you this. coffee and water is offered to me about 6 out of every ten jobs i do. i really never say no to a nice cup of coffee especially in the winter. and i'll always take a bottle of water. i would say about once a month i'm bought lunch or breakfast which i appreciate so much and make sure to do every time some one works on my house. i've had dinner with families prolly six to ten times in my whole career but that's because im usually gone by that point. even if no one will be home while i'm working on the house most people offer me there keurig machine or something similar.
yes, you'll need to open the ceiling. bite the bullet and do it sooner rather than later, because you're likely getting some crazy water damage up there. rotting wood, growing mildew, the longer you put it off the worse is going to be. it might be that a simple small hole will suffice to fix the problem. but the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to be.
if it's being replaced with the same basic type (single handle, two handles, whatever) it should be pretty much plug and play. so to speak.
yes and no. i had a woman who i promise wanted to get a good pounding. but i couldn't act because of sexual harassment shit. if she had grabbed me it would have been on
what about that pyrex container of pasta-soup that i should have dealt with months ago? note: it started out as just pasta.
once i started living on my own & having to actually pay for things, i figured out it was way easier and cheaper to take the time & try to fix something before calling in for help. i taught myself how to do some basic sink fixes and i am an absolute pro at unclogging drains. i know how to jump my car (this may seem like an easy one but a few years ago i knew *nothing* about cars, now i know a little bit) and will be taught how to change a tire soon. (ok ok i know! i didn't have a car for a long time!) i find this sort of work (plumbing, hvac, fixing cars) so interesting & useful. i'm 29 and female and am seriously considering taking some classes or workshops on more useful skills.
it's called a p-trap. it's constantly holds water so you don't smell all the nasty shit coming up your line. also, i wouldn't recommend a snake unless you know what kind of pipes you have. older houses have cast iron piping that rusts and you could easily poke a hole through it, creating a whole new mess of problems. source: used to be a plumber
as someone who stupidly used a pipe snake in the toilet: do not listen to op! don't do it!!! it will scratch the shit out of the porcelain and it will forever be stained.
this is true for tankless on demand gas water heaters?
as an engineer: i love how you're getting clarifications on everything and listing assumptions.
meanwhile in canada in my plumbing class right now there a about 75% 19 yearolds
it kind happened that my age grouo, currently 28, we're kinda told "goto college for xyz else you'll get fucked" so none of us looked into trades...and we still got fucked and many wish we went into trades... now i work in insurance...i have a degree in history and sociology...whhhyyhyyy
because, in fairness, there is really nothing to stay for, despite our psychotic "open for business" governor.
appliance guys are taking a hit from youtube as well. when you can order parts online and there are dudes showing you how to disassemble your refrigerator or change a dryer drum, harry homeowner winds up with decent success rates. then you get called in for fuck ups and make out a little better on that call, but with small ones going away.
if i was 20 again, i'd go to trade school instead of college. what a waste of money that was (for me)
that just means you will corner the market in a decade.
my wife's hair clogs up her bathroom sink and drains slowly. if not the liquid chemical stuff, what do you recommend for clearing a slow-draining sink?
thanks, i was just about to start taking it apart to see for myself when i saw your ama. now i feel more confident. will report back with results
see stuff like this is why i hate plumbing. i can do most things but just plain don't want to. thanks for letting me pay you to put up with this shit (heh).
i had this exact problem, only my wife hadnt noticed she dropped the plastic fork in there. snaking didnt move it and i replaced the toilet. after getting it outside i smashed it open and found the damn fork.
he was eating his taco-in-a-bag while on the toilet and, laughing at a meme while redditing, dropped his fork. happens about once a week to me.
all these joke answers, but very likely it's something thats been on the to do list for a while, and when you have a baby life pretty much stops. so if it doesn't get done now, it will be a few years.
because the new faucets will match the baby. duh. /s
it's basically digested by now, it's basically puke
try a welding intro course - half the men in my class dropped out but i've never seen happier women. a lot of it doesn't apply to anything in a normal home, but it opens up a world of sticking things together with fire. melt stuff : )
replacing alternators and starters are very easy on most cars. learn how to do that and you can save a lot. also, obviously oil changes. i know there are places that do it for $20, but you're getting a shitty filter, and shitty recycled conventional oil. it's worth doing yourself and using the good stuff. also those shops have a tendency to overtorque the drain nut and crack the oil pan, in which case you'll be out a lot. also on older cars, spark plugs are very simple, you just have to be careful not to let them crack and fall into the cyclinder.
i'm not handy at all. in fact, my construction worker step-dad laughs his ass off when i tell him it takes me 4-6 hours to do things he could do in 10-20 minutes. but a couple plumbing things i've done on my own with only youtube videos to help: replace all of the mechanical stuff inside the toilet tank (which includes the rubber thing between the tank and the toilet itself so it doesn't leak) replace pipe from toilet tank to wall valve replace entire drain assembly and pipes under a bathroom sink replace kitchen faucet for someone who isn't handy in the slightest, i feel pretty damn good about handling all of that. yeah, it took me forever, but it saved me a ton of money and helps me feel more personally invested in my home. anyway, my point is that there's some stuff that might seem big to someone inexperienced, but youtube and patience have done wonders with making these repairs accessible to pretty much anyone.
can confirm: poked through 100 year old pipe. $450 later...
so when my plumber hydrojetted my cast iron lateral, that was a bad idea?
a few years ago i was working at a temp agency, where i was sent out on different jobs every day. ended up at a place that had ordered 1000 metal bars for road work stuff. these all had 4 nuts in them. it turned out that it was the wrong type of nut (either us but it needed to be european, or other way around, can't remember). they were all fastened with red loctite. blowtorch, patience and grit. it was fucking hell. then, once i was done with half of them the manager comes out saying: "oh yeah, you can stop that now. the supplier said they will just take them back and deliver new ones instead. good work though!"
in places with population growth, not stagnation or decline.
ontario here, i distinctly remember wondering where the thousand kids who all wanted to be plumbers were going to find 1000 plumbing jobs at the exact same time and why 50% of the curriculum wasn't plumbing since there's no job that makes more than a plumber according to everyone's mental math (the mental math always comes down to making your own hours = infinite hours / unlimited money)
there is still a gap in canada, i'm a pipefitter and the amount of over 50's we have is incredible.
i mean no offense but you kinda got fucked cause you have two almost useless degrees
to an extent i agree. i'm a millennial that has stayed because i love my home. our business environment sucks and our population is dying off quicker than we can replenish it. i hope things brighten in the future but for now i stay for my family and because i enjoy the beauty and isolation of the state.
i sit on a computer all day. some days i wish i went to trade school as i enjoy woodwork and building things, then we get 20 inches of snow and i like being inside with my databases.
am in my 20s in trade school. thinking i should of went to college. grass is always greener and such?
that means when my dad retires (hes already 60) ill probably be a 30 something year old guy telling 50 year old guys what to do. it will be weird for me.
"you have reached your maximum transmission limit for the current billing cycle"
i'm the same way about working on my car. i absolutely despise having grease on my hands
why is everyone but me using a plastic fork on the toilet??
depends on how mechanically inclined you are. a chainsaw can kickback and kill you but a lot of people still trim their own trees and cut their own wood.
i had the same problem called my plumber he said check that hole inside the front of the bowl. it can get clogged if you have hardwater. when you pull the handle its supposed to start to flow of water. you can chip the material out with a screwdriver.
you joke, but that's basically the thinking behind all baby products: repackage existing product in "special for baby!" marketing and sell at 30% mark-up.
as a female bodied person who tried to get in to carpentry, i wish it was as easy as people make it out to be. so many places simply won't call you back if there's a female sounding name on the form.
well i am going to apply. i am a woman and would love to work a trade. i am always wanting to learn more and eager to.
why in the world would half the men drop the course? seems troubling given welding is supposed to pay really well.
i agree that you can save a lot of money on many car repairs by doing it yourself. oil changes just aren't worth it though. even an oil change at the dealer isn't expensive enough (about $40) to make it worth the effort of doing it myself. same with swapping tires. i can pay a local garage $20 to do it in 90 seconds. but replacing an alternator, or starter....definitely do it yourself if you can. also, the biggest scam is paying to replace the cabin and engine air filters. don't every pay anyone to that. on most newer cars you can do this yourself in 60 seconds without any tools.
i didn't know shit about cars until a few years ago aside from watching top gear and how to do an oil change. i had a string of mechanical issues that i was able to fix myself by just doing research. shortly after i bought a used truck, the a/c stopped working, so i got a kit and attempted a recharge, it worked for a few weeks and stopped again. i looked up diagrams and followed the hoses and found a leak. found the part online for $40 and replaced it myself in 15 minutes, recharged it and it's been fine for 3 years. starter went out in my car, looked it up online, 3 bolts, a plug, and $100 later, car was running again. my most recent challenge were replacing the brakes and alternator on my subaru. including the time to go buy the alternator, the whole thing took me maybe an hour. as for brakes, i watched a tutorial on youtube and replaced my pads and rotors for less than $200...advance auto parts coupons are ridiculous if you use them correctly.
for some one that's claims they aren't handy you are doing great. i grew up in construction, i still second guess myself when it comes to plumbing. if you do something wrong it can cause a lot of permanent damage.
the last part with the manager telling you to stop was probably because at the start of the day it hadn't been resolved yet, so he wasn't sure if they'd take them back (maybe the error was on his end) so in that event it would be better to get a jump start on the physical correction rather than sit idle waiting for a response from the supplier. it's just good management in a bad situation.
or in small towns like mine. we only need one plumber...but we don't have one. the last plumber was the town plumber for like, 40 years. he finally retired and now we're having trouble getting stuff dealt with. the problem is, it's not exactly a great area to move to, and it's not like you'll *make bank* here, so...yeah.
apparently in 10 years canadian plumbers will be taking over america.
i'm canadian and went to school for hvac in 2013 at 30 years old. soooo many kids. the school is just pumping them out with no regard for what the work force looks like. half of my classmates are not in the industry or going back to school already.
history is fantastic if you are planning on going to grad school, want to be an intelligence analyst, teaching, or want an office job.
if you think liberal arts degrees are useless, they probably are for you. you likely don't have the creativity to sell the degree path you chose to an employer. that is why you likely campaign for people to get stem degrees, right? stem is great for people who either don't want to have to figure out what to do after school or already know what they want to do. no employer will be looking for a non engineer to fill the engineering position, and most people with bachelors degrees in engineering (without further advanced degrees) tend to work in engineering. a social science major--assuming he mastered the skills of critical thinking, writing, speaking, persuasion, social intelligence, 'well-rounded-ness"--can sell himself and his degree to any firm in any sector. both are worthwhile paths, they are for different people. there is nothing wrong with liberal arts degrees; they, like stem degrees, are not for everyone.
yeah, the beauty and isolation bit is what keeps me around for now, but looking to the future... i always feel our business projects start out as very earnest attempts to bring more activity in to the state and end up as sort of sad jokes
i like to think i could've been a great baker but if i was a baker i would wish i was an it guy. i keep my hobbies separate from my occupation and i'm happy.
i was a union pipefitter and was made general foreman on a major job when i was 26, shortly after my apprenticeship. dudes in their 50's really don't like being told what to do by someone half their age. but it paid around $115k not including overtime so i didn't mind.
only 25 and i run a litigation support office. since we focus on copying/scanning documents, most of the employees are 30s and 40s from the copy boom about 10-15 years ago. they just can't figure out how my 3 years of experience tops their 15, even when i have to repeatedly explain simple tasks and train them. my age doesn't help, because they're older and "more experienced." it's "not their first rodeo" as one likes to put it.
"oh yes i'm very sorry sir, i know you would like to use the toilet but you haven't yet ordered the #2 deluxe package. that burritos will just have to wait."
but human excrements is no problem. this is the same level as people refuse to eat the brown part of a banana. but have no problem giving oral. the human brain keeps surprising me.
you haven't wiped properly until you've tried a plastic fork.
bingo! there was *no* hole at the front of the bowl. completely clogged. all better now.
be prepared to kick ass and take names. the trades can be harsh even on the toughest man. the work is hard. you will injure yourself. most importantly, it isn't some sage space, pcprincipal protected nice working environment. people will say rude things. you will be offended. if you flinch, they will smell the blood in the water. i have seen my fair share of women in the trades, and none of them are to be fucked with. they will snatch your nuts and play craps with them if you do. not trying to scare you or turn you off. there is nothing more that i would like to see than more quality women in the workforce. just a heads up.
sadly, a woman like that takes far longer than 30 seconds to replace.
thanks! as i mentioned, it just takes me a long time. the toilet thing was 6 hours. the drain assembly was 4 hours. i wish i was joking.
oh, i don't disagree with the idea itself.it was a smart idea. the things were shipped in from china, and it was all about time management. he needed the things a couple of days later, and would not have had time to wait another delivery from china obviously. in the end i assume they were able to get it from a closer source. that didn't stop me from wanting to take that blowtorch to his face after being told that all my work was useless though, paid for it or not :)
the problem with small towns is that everyone's uncle is a plumber.../electrician/carpenter/hvac guy. miraculously without being able to do any of those in any professional manner.
we saw the shit storm coming, so we decided to try to help. who better to deal with a shit storm than an army of plumbers? but we underestimated the speed and ferocity it would hit with, and now we fear it may be too late... sorry.
yup pretty much all the skilled trade type jobs in canada are like this right now. they spend all their time talking about how so many jobs are opening up how everyones getting hired and making 6 figures etc, then you graduate and realize it's a cash grab by schools. plumbers and electricians seem to be working into their 70s and they're training about 1000% more students than there are jobs. so basically 80% of my class is unemployed or working in an unrelated field.
i have a degree in history and work in investment banking...
i actually have some optimism for the future, at least for southern maine. the portland area is a much cheaper area than the boston area, but putting an office there wouldn't add too many logistical difficulties. also, i think that as working from home becomes more accepted, maine's "quality of place" will attract high-income professionals. unfortunately, both of these scenarios might be far off.
to be fair, 26 year olds don't really like being told what do by people twice their age.
but soo effective for such a rudimentary fix. solved my slow draining shower instantly (wear rubber gloves when you do it)
women hair in the bathroom is the bane of my existence. first i worked in a youth hostel where cleaning the female showers was the most disgusting thing in the world (some women literally just put a huge ball of wet hair on the sink), then i had a girlfriend whose hair was everywhere, then i moved in a shared flat with a woman with long dark hair and finally moved another three times with the same problem. i had to clean all the pipes every half a year cause all of them were clogged. if you are a woman and have long hair, do everyone around you a favor and use a sieve in the bathroom.
get the wrench he suggested, fought this same issue for over an hour before googling and found about that damn wrench!
as somebody who's done both, i'll take grease every time
i'm a nurse, i can do poop, vomit, urine, blood etc but don't you *dare* come at me with something you coughed out of your lungs. i will slay you.
seriously. you can't even work on them without a bunch of bullshit monopolized certifications from the state. every time someone comes in with a fast and cheap fix, the government is all like "you're running a prostitution and black market organ ring, so we're going to sanction you."
much of that is out of necessity. it's a hardship out here for many families to hire a professional.
we can tell when a shit-storm is coming. you know what a shit-barometer is? it measures the shit-pressure in the air. you can feel it. you hear that? sounds of the whispering winds of shit.
yeah i only had one adult in my life tell me that i was selling myself short getting an english degree. he was my boss at the restaurant i worked at in high school. and although he's a successful restaurateur i didn't take his advice because he's a college dropout who had only worked in kitchens all his adult life. funny that he was more honest with me than any academic advisor or college educated relative about the value of a degree. now i'm not saying the blame is all on others. i should've made better choices, but some better advice would've been nice
check out the ridgid faucet & sink installer. one of the best tools i ever bought. i've used it to replace maybe 5 faucets (and supply lines to match) and this thing makes it so easy. i hate spending time on my back under a sink!
exactly this, my dad had to replace our external power conduit (breaker box was fine) after it was ripped off the wall after someone hit the lightpole... and we had an estimate by professional electricians that estimated like $2k+ do redo the pole and main wiring... we ended up doing it ourselves for just the cost of the material about $300 and it passed inspection...
better advice, more direction, less pressure to go into college immediately. i have an english degree, too, because i enjoyed it in high school, saw that my english teachers were happy, and was discouraged from going to music school. if i'd had time to get experience in life and discover what i would really not mind doing my whole life, i would have just read all those novels on my own time. it took me 10 years total between college + work experience to get a full time tech support job. i could have gotten the same job in 4-6 years by taking 2 years off before college and then studying any computing field to get an associate or bachelor's degree. when i meet younger kids and can hear embarrassment in their voices when they say they're currently doing gened, i encourage them and remind them that it's a much smarter idea than jumping into something because it was the least boring class in high school.
welp, house is filled with creepy centipedes, how do i get rid fo them?
the wire coiled up on it rotates while you're holding it, like holding onto the head of a low speed, high torque drill. that alone is scary to me, it's not strong enough to break bones i don't think but once it starts wrapping you there's nothing you can do about it. stuff like that can get really hairy really quick, it feels like it's going in straight then all of a sudden it bowed between your hands, the bow whished around and landed on your arm, the stopping force caused it to coil between your hands, the coil shortens the available snake and starts pulling it back at both ends, and before you know it the entire snake is in the room, writhing around and coiling tight on anything it touches. on the other end of that, masonry saws look intimidating as hell but i've never used anything that cut so easy. i don't even think they can kick.
did you have to stick your hand down the toilet and chip it while your wrist was basically hitting the taint of b and c? i hate toilets.
the reason the electrician quoted so much is because fuck working with the mains. fuck. that. one misplaced hand or tool... glad no one got hurt.
that's the great thing about house centipedes. they're nature's exterminators and only appear when there's an actual infestation of some other insect/bug. once the infestation is over, they leave in search of more food.
aww *hail* no. i don't fuck with *any* high torque rotating machinery, no fucking way. guy in high school was fucking around and ended up with his entire forearm wrapped around a lathe like a fucking spaghetti noodle because the sleeve of his hoodie got caught in it. also heard some horror stories from old co-workers about an unfortunate incident involving a cement mixer and a man who ended up at least ten feet longer than a human has any business being before the machine was shut off and stopped moving. ever since then i've had a *very* healthy respect for anything with an exposed driveshaft. something that's designed to twist a steel cable through all the twists and turns of your plumbing? fuck *everything* about that, i don't even want to be in the same room while that thing is running, much less operate it myself.
hey jeff! huge fan! what was your favorite scene to film in big lebowski?
hello jeff, i heard for the big lebowski, the jellies worn by the dude were actually a pair of your own. this true? do you still wear said jellies?
the fisher king is one of my favorite films ever. just brilliant and you're great in it! what was it like working with terry gilliam and robin williams?
how many people call you 'the dude' on a daily basis?
hey jeff, do you prefer playing good guys or bad guys???
jeff, which movie do you prefer to watch, tron or tron legacy? did they let you have any input on either storyline, most importantly though tron legacy as we all had plenty of time to think about where we thought or felt the story direction should go? tron has special meaning to me. as a kid my dad took us to see it in the theater. we were so blown away by it we sat through it twice, without paying for the second showing. my first experience with being a nerdy badass. so when tron legacy came out i made sure and bought tickets and took my dad to see it. we sat through it twice as well. thanks for the memories.
holly shit, the dude. if you could give us all some wisdom, what would it be?
just saw starman recently. the bird mimicry was uncanny, how'd you come up with that! also recently saw some of your lovely photography. do you have a favorite camera/lens combo aside from the widelux?
what memories do you have of starman? how do you remember the cooperation with john carpenter?
how do you feel about playing the giver when the role was initially intended to be played by your father? does the role and/or story have a bigger impact on you?
i'm very excited for the giver since you and meryl streep are some of my favourite actors! how was it like to work with her?
hey dude, i've heard the only scene in the big lebowski which was improvised is the line where you call the big lebowski a "human paraquat". is this true, and what is a human paraquat? thanks for taking the time to do this ama!
greetings mr. bridges. what was your impression on the ending of k-pax? do you believe that prot was an alien who returned home with another patient, or just the coping mechanic of robert? what drew you to no kid hungry and what do you believe people can do to help? also, any news on tron 3?
hey, i gotta beverage here man! fav line. anyway love your work. when are you doing another comedy!? holy crap jeff bridges responded to a question of mine!! forgive my noobness, but this is awesome. thanks jeff! by the way didn't mean to imply that r.i.p.d. was not a comedy or funny. i just dig your style man, but do you have to use so many curse words?
jeff, fisher king is one if my all time favorite movies. you and robin williams were just perfect! what was it like working with robin? would you work with him again?
on a rare occasion, i will have one when i am feeling like having something particularly sweet, like drinking a dessert. i like my russians without too much milk, not too much kahlua, just the right proportions.
i didn't draw from john wayne's movie. i remember when the coen brothers first asked me if i wanted to make this movie, i was surprised because i thought john wayne did a very successful movie, and i said "why do you want to do it again?" and they said "have you read the book?" and i had not, so after i did read the book i understood why they wanted to make the movie again. it read like a coen brothers movie. so i jumped onboard, and i didn't really reference the john wayne performance, it was mainly taking my cues from the character in the book.
oh man, that's a tough one! because each scene is so good, you know? the coen brothers wrote such a brilliant script - i don't watch many of my movies on tv, but whenever i'm flipping the channels, and i'm a big flipper when i watch tv, when lebowski comes up, i think "oh i'll just watch a few scenes" and then i get sucked in, because the scenes are so funny. i particularly like that scene where i'm in the car with the big lebowski and he hands me that toe.
that is true! and the costumer for the big lebwoski (and also true grit and many of the coen brothers films) came over to my house, and went through my closet, and there are quite a few articles of clothing that they used for the dude from my closet. the baseball shirt with the famous japanese baseball player on it i stole from my brother beau, that is in the movie. and there might be some other ones, but nothing is coming to mind, i would have to look at the movie and see.
you know, it changes from time to time. i am headed out to comic-con right now, so tomorrow when i get there, i think it will be a good dozen people. it changes from day to day. when i'm at home with my wife, it may never happen.
i'm not sure there's really a difference. i don't really see it in black & white. we all have good & bad aspects to each of us. i don't really approach them that differently. i enjoy playing both.
well, you know, certainly those 2 movies qualify for the home movie aspect of watching those movies for me. where i remember all the good times i had when i was making them, what i had for lunch, what i did after work, those sorts of things. and so the first tron, i really have fun memories from it, it was such an innovative movie at the time, it was shot in 70 mm black & white, and then hand-tinted by a bunch of ladies in korea, the whole thing, to create that world. it was very innovative. and then the other movie was fascinating too, it felt like a lot of it i was actually in the tron world for real. i think i was one of the first actors to have my whole body scanned, so they could make me look young, they actually, you know, put my body into a computer, i remember having that process done and it felt like i was living the tron world for real. and good. well, i'm glad that you had a good experience with the first tron and i hope you and your dad dug the second!
open at your own speed, but open. dig what's happening to you. by "dig" i mean get into it. there are lessons for you there. and when it gets uncomfortable, that's an important time to open and dig. there's treasure in them thar hills.
is lox & bagels a sandwich? i like lox & bagels, i like kind of building that, the ritual of getting your bagel, i like my bagels toasted, almost burned, and then you put a medium spread of cream cheese, and then i like onions quite a bit, so i will put quite a few onions on it. i'm not really into tomato, but once in a while i will surprise myself with tomatoes. and then i'll put the lox on there, and then put some peppers, and then i will cut it in half and go to town. that's the first thing that popped into my head when you said sandwich, but it's hard to beat a good cheeseburger. as i'm thinking about it, and then the eastern thing is cool too, falafels and pita pockets, those are awful great too. i like sandwiches, now i'm thinking about all kinds of sandwiches.
well, i often use my father in my acting quite a bit. i kind of conjure him up and invite him to come into my being, and so i'm sure he was with me a bunch when we were shooting the giver, or i was with him, however you want to put it. like i was saying, so many of my roles, i think of my dad - but this one was a little different for me. i think about my dad all the time when i am working, and maybe with this role it was a little bit more.
well, that kind of depends on the mood i'm in, you know? right now as we talk, i think if somebody offered me that, and i had some bread, or some celery, i could do a peanut butter sandwich crunchy or smooth, i think i would go with crunchy peanut butter with the celery. right now i'm kind of in the mood for celery and some crunchy peanut butter. but next time i might go with the smooth, you know?
iirc paraquat is an herbicide that was sprayed on marijuana fields in mexico by the us gov in the '70s. a lot of the pot was subsequently smuggled into the states and smoked- leading to concerns about toxicity and health problems. in other words, a total bummer, man.
that was a very specific question from a guy who never posted before. smells like his manager.
another comedy? well, the comedic aspects are in most movies i do, i think. i did r.i.p.d. which came out not too long ago, and that was a comedy. i think they really screwed up the editing of the movie, we had a wonderful time making it, with ryan reynolds. wonderful time working with the director. but the suits just cut it against the grain, and i thought, screwed it up. but it's got some funny parts in it.
today is going much better than i had originally anticipated. i did not expect to hear jeff bridges define what love is.
hey man, thanks a lot for that perspective. unfortunately, i spend a lot of time away from my wife due to my business travel. also, she's a vp at a studio here in la and it's extremely hard for us being immersed in a culture that doesn't view marriage as a long term commitment. we try very hard to make time for each other when we're apart, even for the most mundane details about everyday life. it's very encouraging and interesting to hear your perspective as someone also involved in this industry and who happens to be much more in the spotlight than we are.
i always like to drink my white russians with a little straw!
you need to do more westerns. you as either of the lead roles in a lonesome dove remake would be awesome.
i actually auditioned for the part of the female lead. tell the coen bros. they should do more casting calls in jackson, ms!
it makes me happy to know that jeff bridges enjoys the big lebowski as much as the rest of us.
"the goddamn plane has crashed into the mountain!"
"you're not wrong walter, you're just an asshole!" this concept applies to so many facets in life and society. it has been an enduring memory for me. keeping in mind that sometimes even if you're right, it is better to give leeway to others, let them find the path. don't force your will on others because whether as a nation, community, or individual, even if you're right, people don't respond well to assholes. at least that's like, my opinion, man.
it's gotta be a trip watching yourself give one the best comedic performances ever. do you realize that as you're watching the film or do you get pulled in and go, "this dude is fucking good!"
holy shit beau bridges is your brother. how did i not realize this?
the fisher king is my favorite movie ever made. i fell in love the first time i saw it, and all these years later it is still what i put on when life gets me down. was michael jeter as amazing in life as he was on screen? he seemed to have a sort of happy magic in all of the things he did, and despite not knowing him i was immensely sad when he passed away.
thank you, mr. bridges, for taking the time to answer me.
i was one of those poor kids who had to arrive early to eat.... thank you
being a former poor kid who had to show up early for breakfast at school. i tip my hat to you.
i believe the best movie villains are played by actors who think they are playing the hero of the film.
heh. whenever some device or equipment around the house can't seem to be repaired, friends & family members are prone to yelling "tony stark was able to build this in a cave! with a box of scraps!"
woah this is should be a big story. if that film wasn't a hit, marvel wouldn't have become the gigantic movie power it is now. and now we find out that they basically winged the whole thing dang.
everything is better when hand-tinted by a bunch of ladies in korea.
dude, i just want to tell you, like personally, that you are *really* knocking this ama thing out of the park. 11 out of 10. most celebrities don't even come close to this level of involvement.
thank you so, so much for the reply! this is turning out to be one of the best amas ever, all your answers are so detailed and insightful. honestly, thanks for being this awesome. also, holy crap, i had no idea about the coen brothers actually having written the script specifically for you. that's amazing. one of my favourite lines too! there isn't a single situation in which it cannot be used to combat an argument. also the whole zen buddhism aspect of it is so cool, i had never though of it that way before, but i can totally see it now. i'm going to read the crap out of that book, thank you so much for letting me know about it! p.s. oh my god. jeff bridges actually answered me. oh my god. *fangirling so hard right now*
smart. you can't lock yourself down to one style of peanut butter.
that's a very accurate way to describe it. i'm still excited to see how they're planning on doing the big reveal for the movie. it seems much simpler to do in writing. i see now why i am not in the movie business.
what is love? jeff bridges just told me, just told me, oh lord.
it could only be better if we had an audio recording of him saying it
i appreciate your thoughtful response to jeff bridges coupled with your username.
bartender here, i think if jeff bridges, came into my bar, and ordered a white russian, my head would explode.
duvall killed it but a jeff bridges augustus mccrae would be awesome
i watched true grit for the fifth time an hour ago as preparation for this ama. still great!
anyone who doesnt is letting their view by tinted by nostalgia. the john wayne one was campy as fuck.
i know! a lot of actors will try to really separate themselves from a single role that they are well known for, and try to put more emphasis on newer, more obscure work. jeff bridges never seems to shy away from the dude.
brandt's face while lebowski says that is the funniest part.
i learned that sometimes it's better to be kind than right. that's a lesson that walter never learned.
have ya seen adventures of baron munchhausen? my favorite gilliam film aside from fear and loathing. loved it as a kid. still do. up on netflix now.
right? i got fixated at that part and dwelled for a moment on the poetry of it.
the guy in front of me at the theater absolutely exploded in laughter when the scientist responded that he was not tony stark. i mean, it was a funny line, but the guy cackled for a solid twenty seconds.
they did a great job on my car windows but the freight charge was unbelievable.
this question requires an answer! out of jeff bridges and meryl streeep, who is germany and who is england?
good work! that was some fantastic stuff he just revealed.
i'm now confident with saying i like both types. i will link to this anytime someone questions my choice of smooth pb
yeah it would be hard to beat duvall in lonesome dove.
i am so jealous that you have time in your life to prepare for an ama.
the way i heard it is "john wayne plays john wayne. jeff bridges plays the damn character".
the girl was *much* better in the new one. i thought matt damon was not great (and he is usually awesome).
brandt's face any time the big lebowski is talking is just absolutely hilarious.
this is so totally true. one of the biggest, best things i've learned from being married. it is soooo much better to be kind than right. it is so much better to be compassionate than to try to hammer your point home. what matters is the relationship, not the circumstances.
well, jeff's character in iron man comes to mind. i can't find any interviews off-hand but almost every time an actor is asked about a villainous character they played, they seem to insist the character is not a villain, but really misunderstood, or their motivation was good. "what was it like playing the bad guy?" "oh i never thought of him as bad, just trying to win the struggle" or similar. like jeff said we all have good and bad sides, even the real heroes. it is history that defines who the heroes and villains are.
i recently started reading dudeism literature and digging dudeism, all of a sudden jeff bridges does an ama... its a sign
haha, i know, right? so far every single one of his answers has been interesting and thoughtful. man, i have new found respect for the guy. he's awesome.
seriously, this is one of the best ama ever, jeff is really giving us his inner thoughts, not some fabricated answers. this is fucking brilliant, one of the many reasons i love reddit.
agreed. what is with the call for remakes? lonesome dove is a classic, no, the classic.
sweet zombie jesus philip seymour hoffman was the only person who could have made such a minor role as brandt as memorable as he was.
you probably thought todd bridges was much younger.
that's messed up, man. we didn't have tokens. we had fingerprint scanners that would automatically take money from your account/not charge you if you had free meals, or you could just pay cash.
clu from tron: legacy is another great example of that, actually. he's just trying to do the right thing for his people. the character is actually noble, in his own way. it just comes out a little... differently.
tony stark was able to build one in a cave!! ...with a bunch of scraps!
become an ordained minister of dudeism. i did a few years back.
since you seem like a pretty big fan of his (like me), i'll share this quickly: i saw him in a small santa barbara movie theatre a year or two ago, and i fanned out too hard to be able to approach him. he was just standing there waiting for his wife (as i was for my girlfriend), checkin out the movie posters on the wall, and it was a perfect opportunity to strike a quick chat, and i wanted to talk with him so badly, but i completely froze. i guess my point is that, when i saw him in person, i realized how much i really looked up to and admired him for what he's done for culture. my impulse was to want to just ask him questions for hours on end.
umm... the trailer i saw did have black and white until the reveal.
privy is used in this sentence as "sharing in the knowledge of (something secret or private)" to rephrase the original "i didn't know about this new shit" has the same meaning. another definition of privy is "a toilet located in a small shed outside a house or other building; outhouse." using the word shit is an allusion to this second meaning.
brandt has got to be one of my favorite characters in film. when he hands the dude the ransom note and lowers his hands like a robot...oh, man, it kills me every time.
wtf fingerprint scanners? we had student ids with a bar code.
i got really high and watched the big lebowski and looked it up wikipedia and then found dudeism and looked it up and looked around the site for a while and when i woke up the next day i read an email that said i was an ordained minister and i was like "did i get so high i became a dudeist priest on accident?". yeah, i did.
dangit! i know what you mean. the freeze is so annoying. like, imagine all the stuff you could talk about, if you could only get past it. somehow i think that would have been a very interesting conversation! but anyway, thank you for sharing the story. and yes, you're right, i *am* a big fan (to the extent that the first and the only time i made the reddit front page, it was a post about jeff bridges). uh oh, now i seem some kind of stalker. being a fan is hard. : p
i commend you, as i said to the other guy, it's a pity that the first guy cashed in on the karma :(
either google has betrayed me or i have suffered a synaptic lapse.
can you do weddings and stuff since you're an ordained minister?
looks like *you* picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.
hi sacha, you have done a lot of crazy things along your way. is there anything you wouldn't do because it's too gross or freaks you out?
how hard (not your penis) was it doing the wrestling scene in bruno?
did you catch any flak for your oscars performance?
hey sacha! couple questions for you what's the craziest fan experience you've ever had? have you ever had a fan believe you to always be one of your characters, rather than an actor, due to the style of some of your movies? thanks very much! much love
what question would ali g most like to ask donald trump?
hi sacha! big fan of your work, looking forward to seeing the new movie. if you had to pick one out of your characters to live as for the rest of your days, who would it be and why?
hey sacha! have you ever thought of doing a certain character but decided not to because the world isn't ready? maybe the character was a bit *too* controversial?
do you regret doing anything at all that you've ever done?
i love hearing you every time you are on howard stern. what are your favorite things to do to publicize a movie? are there anything's the studio has you do that you dread doing?
so what in the hell was censored from tv and can we expect more of that from your new movie??
do you worry that american audiences won't get the full comedic effect of the "football hooligan" stereotype?
how have you managed to have so much creative freedom in what you do and say? have there been things that the studio or distributor said no to and you had to fight for? have they ever won?
will you please, for the love of god, star as freddy mercury?
just one thing: how did it feel to be practically the only one in les mis to actually use a french accent?
how did you get pamela anderson to agree to being kidnapped in borat?
would you rather have penis sized nipples, or a nipple sized penis?
hey sacha, borat is one of my favorite movies of all time and it never fails to crack me up. have you ever kept in touch with any of the people you encountered along your journey? would love to know if you've talked with the jewish couple, that scene was hilarious!
being british and a comedian, was charlie chaplin any inspiration on you comedy and filmmaking?
yes, it's called *grimsby* in australia and england, but it's called *the brothers grimsby* here. that wasn't my idea.
u/iamnotevensorry, yes there are lots of things i would not do. i only ever really do something if i find it hysterically funny. and i have a mental problem, which is, i don't see the consequences of my actions. so, i will often come up with something in the writers room, with me and my colleague, and not really think through how i'll feel when i get to the day when i have to shoot it. so, case in point, the naked fight seemed very very funny when i started talking about it in the writers room, but it got to the day, and when i was confronted with a naked 260 lb. man, who had not cleaned his asshole for 25 years, the joke suddenly did not seem very funny.
the worst part filming *borat* was the naked fight, because i had a 250 lb. man's ass on my face, and his buttocks was so big that i couldn't actually breathe when i was underneath there. so, i had about 30 seconds of air under there before i had to breathe in. and i had a signal with the director, which was when i thought i was going to pass out, i would hit the mattress three times. if you look at the *borat* film now, you will see that i do hit the mattress three times, and the director didn't stop filming, which meant i was faced with this very stark choice, which was either to die, or to breathe in the rancid air from my costar's rectum. and when i was underneath there, i decided to die. luckily, my co-star moved off and i managed to finish the scene. otherwise, that would have been a very inglorious end to my life.
u/simb5, i think it's probably bruno, because his hygiene is the best. when i was in *borat*, i wore a suit that hadn't been washed for a dozen years, and i can't wear deodorant, i'm walking around with a staff for a year at a time, and occasionally i even have a 260 lb. man sit on my face. so it's quite unpleasant to play. but with bruno, he's clean, he smells great, i have at least one or two people shaving off all my body hair every day, and he's very well moisturized. and of course he has a bleached anus, which any man secretly wants.
it was very nerve wracking because i almost got killed two nights in a row. we did the first one in texarkana in arkansas, and that ended up going very badly. they started throwing metal chairs into the ring and a huge sterioded ultimate fighter ended up jumping into the ring and attempted to beat me up. so i had to escape. we drove through the night to another town in arkansas and did the cage match again for the second time and it ended up provoking a riot in the stadium. but luckily i had built a trap door in the cage which led to a tunnel that was reinforced, and at the end of the tunnel there was a car that was running with its door open, ran out, and me and my co-star got off scot free.
u/limbodog, yes the producers of the oscars were upset, but they've been upset with me before. i assume i will not be invited back.
incredible! a dream come true. he is the maestro, probably the greatest living film director, and possibly the greatest film director of all time. i had the privilege of studying how he made movies for six months. he usually sits alone watching the movies, and i asked whether i could sit quietly next to him and learn how to direct. and after a month, he allowed me in the chair next to him, and it was incredible. the guy is unparalleled.
this reminds me of youtube comments where they believe borat or bruno are a real person. it's hilarious
trump is a misogynist and i think it is disgusting the views he has on bitches.
thats probably the best dvd extra i've ever seen. i could. not. believe. that guy didn't lose his mind. that might be the most patient man on the planet.
yes. i did used to do a comedy character on the circuit who was called the mujahideen, and he was a very nice fundamentalist terrorist who just wanted to be loved and deliver stand-up comedy lines. in the end the character was too divisive. fine by me, i then came up with ali g.
yes. there was something that i regret not doing, which was, i was on this australian late night talk show, and the talent booker had made a massive mistake. he booked the australian prime minister on the same talk show. i was doing *bruno*, and i had a strip tease routine fully planned, including tearaway pants and this g-string. and my intention was to lap dance the prime minister of australia, and stick my crotch in his face. it would have been an international incident, and probably would have got me barred from australia. but, unfortunately, i wimped out of doing it, and eventually was also barred by his own security.
u/rekips, i tend to do whatever i want when i'm publicizing a movie. in cannes, it was my idea to go in a green thong on the beach and surround myself with some girls. and when i was publicizing *borat*, the studio did not want me to stand outside the kazakhstan embassy and deliver a press conference, but because i own the characters, i have the freedom to do whatever i want with them. so, i managed to avoid the normal boring press junkets that other actors are forced to do. and of course, pretend that they enjoy.
uh, u/tall_and_thin, i will not. i explained why on howard stern yesterday--check it out.
not gonna happen. the band owns the rights, and they wanted freddy to die halfway through the movie, and the rest of it be about how the band went on, "going from strength to strength" whatever the hell that means. so after 6 years, he gave up. (source: his interview with howard stern this week.)
my favorite book at the moment is a book called "thinking, fast and slow" by professor kahneman, which is a book on how the brain reacts in instinctive and often illogical ways to stimuli. and it explains things like why we would vote for a presidential candidate who could destroy our country.
if i remember correctly he dropped it a few times when his character was doing something particularly underhanded/stupid. it was pretty funny thinking back on it.
pamela was the only real actor in the whole movie that was in on it i remember reading
there was a guy called mohamed al-fayed whose son, dodi al-fayed, tragically died with the late lady diana in paris. he came on the ali g show and was hilarious. so he was probably my favorite. my least favorite was i did an interview with david duke as ali g, and it was quite unpleasant because he brought some neo-nazi security with him and my researcher had to spend the evening keeping the security guards away from me. and even though my researcher is jewish, he had to pretend to be a complete antisemite and neo-nazi in order to keep the body guards attention and let me interview duke alone. in the end, i never showed the duke interview, because his views are so extreme and horrifying that giving any publicity to him felt immoral.
in germany it is called "the spy and his brother".
i live in texarkana, and this is heartbreaking to me, because bruno is so fucking funny.
the mafia impersonator sounds like he is actually you. are you sure you aren't him?
probably wouldn't have been so patient if he wasn't 4 feet from a camera
same! it's one of our favourite jokes in our house!
you would've had to face a serious booting for that
was it abbott? oh my god it would have been amazing...
just out of curiosity, are you allowed to go to kazakhstan if you wanted to?
strength to strength? i mean, not to knock the other band members, but all of their best work was done when mercury was alive. the average person couldn't name a queen song that didn't feature his vocals. you could arguably *end* the movie with the band moving on triumphantly after mercury's death, but to have his death halfway through the film is a disgrace to his memory and his importance not just to the band, but to music in general, as if to say, "oh, that doesn't matter, we're just fine without him". fuck. that.
i think the rest of queen thinks that we will rock you is their really big hit.
holy shit, i was supposed to read this book for an ethics class, but i blew it off. gonna go find it now. thanks sacha
if it's any consolation, that was a truly *excellent* piece of cinema.
i remember reading somewhere that he said it was the only part of that movie that was staged (for obvious reasons)
it's so heavily on his mind that it gained 10 pounds
step 1) buy anal bleaching kit at local adult sex shop step 2) apply gel to anus area. step 3) after desired time passed. rinse and wipe away. step 4) insert your boyfriends penis in your anus.
were those guys chanting "fuck that shit" @ 1:50? ... bit of a mixed message.
never saw bruno but i may go watch it after seeing how pissed off these people got
it seems i forgot just how...gay that scene was. in arkansas no less! i'm not surprised he almost got killed, the south is still pretty intolerable of gay-pda.
that's the kind of result-oriented president we need.
wow, all of a sudden it feels really 2008 in here.
i believe chris rock did a bit on this, but no white man would switch place with any black man.
he chose to die, instead of breathing in through the unwashed rectum of a 270 pound man
also. queen (brian may) wanted freddie to die in the middle of the movie.. and the 2nd half to show how queen continued strength to strength after his death. not only did queen not release any good music post freddie, but as sacha says, people want to see the movie because of freddie. what kind of movie kills off the star half way through?
i didn't even know queen was still active following freddie mercury's death. til.
but that was with freddie mercury. are you talking about some lesser known later version?
i have that book and i have to start reading the first page after maybe two years. it's so big. and i never seem to find the time.
the silence after "hot guys in the world" comment looking up at the stars is breathtaking.
iirc she was the only person there in on it, all of her security and the public had no idea.
for a man of his status, al-fayed was incredible how he played along and took the jokes. brittons, is he known to be this laid back and guesting tv shows?
"oh i just hate those homos so much i would fuck them right in the ass! right in the ass i tell you!"
they're the pinnacle of "i can't believe this is happening"
i'd switch places with most black men who are rich.
"i mean i want something good for my last meal, am i right?"
how did those guards not corpse!?! damn impressive!
lol you just blew my mind. never thought his name was a hommage to freddie
the doors were active after jim morrison's death too.
it is a really dense book, and it actually works well to read a chapter and digest it for a while. i think you get more out of it if you don't try to read it all at once. the book challenges a lot of the standard ways of thinking and of viewing the world. definitely worth the time.
that sounds like a good story. i wonder why he never mentions it.
without context this doesn't really answer anything. who is james?
the meme surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the reddit together.
i'm sure chris rock is ecstatic to find out you would happily violate the parameters of his physically impossible joke.
do you think terrorists do the airoplane sounds when feeding they're kids?
mr. simpson shush! disparaging the boot is a bootable offense!
to be fair, they did release couple good songs - no one but you and say it's not true. the rest is utter shit.
and, as an homage a few decades later, *scream* even earlier in the film.
i hope he said that to his face because it's so true
he should ask a bunch of questions about lorne next time he has an snl alum on.
i wish gabe loved valve's products and customers as much he "loves" dota.
that was a really good move to cast drew barrymore. there's a meta thing going one when you watch a movie that says, "oh, she can't die, it's drew barrymore" and that movie really exploited that well.
i wish gabe loved his customers like kanye loves kanye.
have you done anything recently that made you think, "i can't believe i did that?!"
how long did that "hahahahahahaa" email take to type?
channing! the world has gotta know, what are the components of your perfect sandwich?
what's currently your favorite tv show and which character do you think embodies you the most?
channing thanks for taking time to hang out on reddit today. everyone has a golden rule in life, besides having great abs, whats your golden rule?
you can only bring three things to an island for the rest of your life. what are they and why?
what is something that not a lot of people know about you?
do you do full frontal in magic mike xxl? asking for a friend
hey channing. just one quick question: what toppings are on your ideal pizza?
if you could play someone from history who would it be?
what was the last picture you took with your phone?
how many times is too many times to see step up? i think i may have a problem.
so, if you could have one super power, what would it be, and why?
hi chan, who is your favorite musician and what songs do you like?
what's the dirtiest thing a fan has ever said to you?
what is your favorite thing to do when you're having a bad day?
do you ever get lost looking into matt bomer's eyes?
kill one, marry one, and fuck one... ray romano, danny devito, and gilbert gottfried?
hello channing tatum! this is something i've always wanted clarified since it happened...were you ever in sea-tac airport at the chili's restaurant looking for a beer but idless? i was the one working there who had to make the difficult decision as to whether we could serve you or not. it all ended with a picture of you giving each of us a peck on the cheek, myself included. it's still one of my favorite stories to tell so i hope i wasn't just duped by a very convincing look-alike.
is there anything you can tell us about your upcoming gambit movie? thanks for the ama
tatum. favorite movie title besides magic mike and magic mike xxl that can double as a porno movie name? example: "gone in 60 seconds". go?
i read that you had a care bears themed birthday party as a kid - so awesome - which character is your favorite? do you still have any of your bears? thanks! :o)
do you enjoy making millions of people sexually frustrated on a daily basis?
if you were a hot dog, and you were starving, would you eat yourself? also, what is it like to work with jonah hill?
hey channing! i've heard you're good friends with shia labeouf. what do you think of his recent motivational speech? did he bring you to tears and inspire you to chase your dreams? do you think you can make your own motivational video and one-up him?
hey, question: why did you name your daughter everly? it's a really nice name. also, do you like get nervous before acting or do you just go ahead and do it ?
is it true that in 7th grade you got in a fight because you wore an "i hate pizza" shirt to school?
would you play james bond if you were offered the role?
hi chan! really cool that you're doing this! how has becoming a dad changed your life?
my best friend sent me a screenshot of your twitter yesterday and said "ask him why he's so dang hot" so here i am. channing tatum, why are you so dang hot? and which character of all the films you've been in do you think is the closest to your actual persona? why?
hi channing!! who would win in a fight, you or joe manganiello?
hey channing, can you share some tips/tricks to stay in shape? (diet/workouts) thank you!
would you rather fight a danny devito sized john stamos or a john stamos sized danny devito? you're both naked.
mr. tatum, you're one of my top 10 favorite actors, and i happen to be a straight male. how do i get away with going to see magic mike xxl in the theaters, without my sexuality coming into question?
will your cajun accent in gambit be better than your hispanic accent in 22js? ;) "my name remy."
hello mr. tatum!! its great to see you so passionate about the runa foundation. how did you first out about this cause? also, what new exciting dance moves will we see in magic mike xxl. can't wait to see it. :)
i loved your support of the lgbtq community at the la pride parade. fantastic! from which of your (male) magic mike costars would you most like to receive a lap dance?
tanning chainum, how can i convince my gf to have a threesome?
what's the weirdest place you've ever dumped out?
i just went to iceland and tried to do a small expedition across the glacier and we didn't make it. we had to be emergency evacuated as there was a white out blizzard which i got to take a poop in. it actually freezes before it hits the ground.
i'm sure exactly how long. i hit the h and a for a long time before i realized i could copy and paste. i'm not the most tech savvy person around but it did become a lot easier and faster.
k get ready: it's very complicated. bread, white. peanut butter, not crunchy, creamy. grape jelly, double portion, more than you think should actually fit on a piece of white bread. bread. and then some cheetos shoved in there, and then you're good to go.
it's really hard to not want to be joffrey on game of thrones. my favorite thing that i've seen yet wasn't on tv, it was on youtube. it was called kung fury and it was the best thing i've seen in a long time.
that's a complicated one to answer. jonah is one of the most fascinatingly dualitied people. he can completely be one of the most intellectually smart and quick people that i've ever been around, and then he can come down to my level and just be very kid like and just play without any pretension. i love him. he's like a brother to me.
this is probably going to be superlame but my golden rule is the golden rule. do onto others as you would have them do onto you. and that's about it.
how about a magical seashell that's always filled with bourbon. and i would like a magical palm tree that had a lot of shade with instead of coconuts there's just peanut butter jelly sandwiches with cheetos underneath. and my wife that is always happy and possibly naked.
always a hard question. i think a lot of people of people say how lucky they are. and i don't think people really understand how lucky i am to even be in a conversation like this right now. it's nuts. i mean, i somehow made a lot of right decisions, i'm sure i made a lot of wrong decisions, but i don't even know the constellation of events that led to me getting there. just how crazy it is. looking around and seeing how many ridiculously talented people i'm around everyday.
oh man. crossbow, straight up, and i'd want an army of ninja chimpanzees that crush people all around me.
i'm kinda boring. i just like peps. pepperoni and cheese. i'm not a very adventurous eater. i like what i like and stick to it.
i would actually love to play genghis khan. but john wayne did that. and it wasn't such a good idea i think.
it's kind of boring. cookie dough. but then you can put cookie dough on just about anything and i would eat it.
the last picture i took on my phone i was going into a meeting and there was a tv on the wall playing cnn and they were talking about jurassic world shattering box office openings so i sent that to my buddy pratt. i'm just really proud of him, happy for him. it also said something about southeast texas weather pressure. that's what i was really trying to tell pratt, to make sure he was aware of a pressure front coming in.
hahahahaha! i guess you need to see it as many times as it takes you to realize how bad my acting is in it. and fast forward to the dancing parts after that.
i wish that i could make anyone at any point just happen to be naked. not for the reasons that everyone thinks. because people get really nice when they get naked. like okay, i can't be an asshole. people aren't assholes when they get naked (for the most part). they are thinking about what they look like. shitty answer, i tried to do something funny and it didn't work.
kendrick lamar is dope. i like kinda everything. i listen to ben howard a lot, i mean i love anything pop and i really love old stuff. i'll put on nina simone pandora and let it rock. i like everything but polka music. no offense to the polka community.
oh fuck. god let's see. no one has anyone said let's go to the alley and fuck or anything like that. it's kinda shocking that no one has said that. their behavior gets bizarre and that's the strange part. also othing that anyone would ever say to me would be worse than what's going on in my head.
oh man. i love pinterest. swear to god. just to not think about all the shit i have to do or what's going wrong, i just go and look at pinterest. or flipboard.
to be completely honest, clubbing. i straight learned how to dance in the club. i don't know how to describe it any other way. i never took a dance class or anything, when i was really really young i remember going to the theater with my mom and my sister, so me and my mom sat in the theater away from my sister and her friends, it was breakin' 1, and my mom said after the movie i started trying to do headstands. my mom said i mortified my sister. but i think i was always fascinated by physical things. but i can't tell you i had any training other than going out to florida clubs and getting sweaty.
gilbert gottfried, danny devito and ray romano? i'd fuck danny devito, as i was saying earlier it could be fun. i'd marry ray romano, because i think he has a pretty solid perspective on marriage. i don't know who would be the male or female, you figure it out. and i like gilbert gottfried but i wouldn't mind killing him.
that absolutely was me. because i love chili's. and no one believed me that i got into an airport without my id. i just wanted a beer and some chicken crisps, and i actually couldn't get either of them for a while, because i remember you guys didn't have chicken crisps either! what's a chili's without chicken crisps?
we finally found someone that i really do believe wants to make gambit, it will be the second standalone character. and i just really think because gambit is not the most popular or the biggest hero, i think there's a really unique opportunity. marvel's done a lot of great movies that have made a ridiculous amount of money, and it's always good to figure how to change the form.
hahahahaha what! that's like a psychological profiling question. yeah, why not. i like to eat. let's just be real about it. jonah is one of those people who if you just sit back and just watch him you in no way shape or form can understand how he's doing what he's doing. he's the fastest most quickest wittiest person i've ever met. and i think people when they think of comedic actors they forget that they are people with a point of view and experiences and depth. and jonah is one of the most sensitive and deep people i know. and that's why i think he can be a comedic actor and a deep actor asd well.
i wish i could say i love the everly bros but that's not why we named her everly. the simple story is my wife was driving down the street one day and heard it in her head. so happy wife happy life. and yeah, i do get nervous to act, it kind of depends on what it is really. doing snl was by far the most terrifying thing that i've ever done, because there is a lot of reading involved, and i don't read that well out loud. i get terrified and freeze up. so it really depends on what kind. if i'm really super prepared and i'm off book, i'm not nervous. there's no wrong way to do it, just different ways to do it, because you never know what is going to work.
oh that's tough. it would be a very hard turndown. but i don't know. there is a very strong strong voice inside that tells me james bond probably should always be a true united kingdomer. i'm all down for changing things completely but the true nature of 007 is i feel just very innately english, it shouldn't be an american putting on an english accent.
i don't know. i wish i could come up with something funny for this answer. my mom is beautiful and my dad doesn't suck either.
hell yeah its okay if you call me chatum, it's actually way cooler of a name. my favorite movie that ive been a part of is magic mike, wait scratch that. it's step up. where i met my wife. because if i don't say that my wife will kill me.
if you have to have abs for her to stay with you, might be a sign for you to reevaluate how much she loves you. i don't know. running dawg. running and situps.
oh man. if you eat it and it makes you happy you probably shouldn't have it. and if you do it and it sucks you're probably doing the right thing. but you can't have one with out the other. a lot of people just work out and don't actually diet and they wonder why they aren't getting the results they want, and some people do the exact opposite and wonder the same thing. i really think you have to do both.
can i just fight a danny devito sized danny devito because i think i could take him and i would be on top or i could just use him as a spinner as i'm assuming we're going to have sex after we fight if we're naked.
the funny this is about xxl it is such a movie that is made for women but if i pitched the movie like it's the movie road trip then guys would see it. truly it's just about a bunch of guys being friends and hanging out who just get raunchy with some women at the end of the movie. everyone will have fun with this movie.
offer her something that she wants if she doesn't want that. and two it can't be a double standard. if you want a threesome with a girl then you have to offer her a threesome with a guy. it's all equal opportunity. so be careful what you ask for.
does this mean where i fell out of a car or where i took a dump? please clarify! haha
i have a little 2 year old baby girl and free time is sparse and few an far between and any time that i get is spent with her and my wife. in between all the danny devito sex and fight sessions.
that makes me so happy to hear. if 23 jump street were just you two sitting in alone in a blank room in the middle of ohio i would go see it. you're relationship is adorable.
i've never thought this hard about what i want done onto me.
i guess the daughter doesn't make the cut. lol but yay for bourbon
you seem like a nice guy who appreciates what he has. that's great
but you put cheetos on your pb&j and that means the world.
i'm pretty sure you already possess that superpower!
channing can we go fuck in an alley? please its for science
it is my solemn promise to you that should we ever cross paths, i will point to the nearest alley and request a fuck with you. scouts honor.
you should try www.reddit.com actually, you should probably stay away. there are some weirdos here.
you should've tried to call the sequel magic mike 2 electric boogaloo in honour of your dancing origins
confirmed, channing tatum wants to kill gilbert gottfried
wait. you got into an airport without your id? i want to be a movie star now!
i loved gambit since i was a teenager. always wondered why they never made a movie with him in it playing a big role. have you any idea as in when gambit should be coming into theatres?
fucken hell... he's answering shit honestly? respect.
i'd like to point out that the last batman, the last superman, and the last spiderman (sort of) were redcoats. stealing bond from them is more than justified.
you fucking gave her your username, didn't you? rookie mistake
i feel like when anyone asks this question of, "what do you do to be so in shape?," they expect the answer to be something other than eating healthy and working out. it will always be dedication to eating healthy and working out... every damn day. simple as that.
tell him to just take a girl, he may even get laid afterwards
he can now say that you personally told him to watch it.
ok, channing, real talk. does your wife get jealous of all the time you spend having sex with danny devito?
that's the most positive and depressive thing i've ever heard
with ice cube yelling at them in front of japanese jesus.
thought of it in less than a second. however, as a heterosexual male, i am not sure i would actually want to see it happen.
she looks like a famous actress but i can't really place her.
for real. dudes probably seen more titties in person than i have seen on the internet.
take me with you. i'll just sit by the dumpster and watch, i promise.
seriously, channing tatum is pretty fucking cool.
party proper here.. it was for a film class or something, students sent in scripts that shia acted out in front of a green screen. he didn't wake up and go "time to motivate some would-be beans"
to be fair why wouldn't he? he's an actor not a politician giving an ama
how do you think canada feels? one superhero that anyone cares about, and that aussie hugh jackman has kept him all to himself.
but let's face it, they're way better at american accents than we are at british ones.
that's why you gotta pick a name you're not even comfortable saying aloud to people.
today dozens of redditors discover that what they are doing is called funemployment
i want your life goal to be to see more digital breasts than channing in real life.
you can video tape it too so i never forget and can show my grandchildren
"i'm crushing on a girl but she's hooked up with a few of my friends, should i do it anyway? ... hell yeah"
incredibly attractive man marries incredibly attractive woman, more at eleven.
thank you! it's my first attempt to step up and be like the masters!
are you ever flipping channels at home, see "seinfeld" is on, and watch it?
are there any jokes that you love to tell but audiences never quite get it?
hi jerry. how come you don't do movies? you're amazing. hope all is well
jerry, you're the man! i'll do my first open mic soon and i'm wondering **how do you organize and develop your material and various jokes?** do you have notebooks full of detailed notes and jokes, or do you just sketch them out and wing it on stage?
do you have a joke that you're the most proud of because you invented it? is there a joke you wish you made yourself?
what is your relationship with larry david like today?
hi jerry, not that you've run out of people to have coffee with, but have you entertained the idea of doing new episodes with previous guests?
which dead comedians would you have liked to have on comedians in cars getting coffee?
hello....... jerry. what, if anything, did you take from the seinfeld set?
jerry, i love the show, especially all the trips through the hudson valley and west connecticut. what's your favorite drive through south ny or west connecticut?
what is your least favourite car that you have owned?
what are some of the phrases you still use from "seinfeld?"
how do you take your coffee? you seem to drink a lot of it in seinfeld and comedians in cars getting coffee.
hey jerry. i'm studying for the bar exam. any advice?
any behind-the-scenes story you can tell us about the president obama ccc episode? seemed like a lot of fun.
jerry as someone who watched your show religiously, i've always felt a true connection between the crew to truly make the characters come alive. its as if i was watching my best friends live right in front of me. thank you for your show, the laughs, and more importantly the memories. that being said, how often do you hear from everyone? do you guys keep in touch? thanks!
hi jerry! what is the real story behind the appearance and reference of superman in seinfeld?
did you know garry shandling had serious health issues when you had him on the show? it was a lovely nostalgic episode, particularly wonderful that you made it with hindsight.
hey jerome. i just saw you perform live in reading, pa a few weeks ago. what the hell were you doing in reading, pa?
hi jerry, i'm an avid cereal fan. what's your favorite cereal?
what is your favorite movie you've starred in and why was it bee movie?
hey jerry, on comedians in cars, you have already had a few, if not most, of the late night guys on the show. so my question is do you plan on driving conan o'brien around in the future?
what should i say/do to larry david if i ever see him on the street?
how do you feel about the stereotypical "what's the deal with..." joke format that people use when talking about you?
do you think julia louis-dreyfus got a kick out of "playfully" pushing you so often during seinfeld?
i recently saw a video on /r/cringe with you interviewing paul mccartney's daughter and he seemed to be rather offended with you joking around during the interview. did anything happen after that?
mr. seinfeld, how has the bee movie impacted your daily life?
hi jerry! have you and julia ever talked about making a guest appearance on veep? is this something you'd consider? have a great day!
thanks for doing another ama! i'm in the middle of judd's book, sick in the head. you're mentioned a lot by other comedians as a mentor and someone who gives a lot of great advice. what's the most iconic (or important) piece of information you've ever received in regards to your life/career? what was the context in which you received it?
hi jerry! longtime fan! simple question; what is your favorite seinfeld episode and why?
who has been the funniest comedian besides yourself on comedians in cars getting coffee?
what is the oddest part about socializing with super wealthy people when you find yourself at a particularly swank affair?
i don't, but i do consider it for a split second and then i go "i can't do it." it's like watching your home movies, it's just me watching me. it's weird, don't you think?
patrick stewart was on conan years ago and told a story about being in a hotel room by himself, years after star trek: the next generation had been canceled: it's like 1:00 am, he orders some room service and starts flipping channels and happens to come across a random episode of tng. because they had shot so many episodes and production was often so hectic (shooting different parts from different episodes in the same day, shooting scenes out of order, etc.), he had no memory of that particular episode or how it ended. so he starts watching it and pretty soon he's caught up in the story, excited to see how it ends... and then the room service shows up. and stewart realized that, to the room service guy, it must have looked really sad/pathetic, patrick stewart sitting alone in his hotel room excitedly watching old reruns of himself on star trek. i wish i could find the clip of him telling the story.
we have a new episode of comedians in cars coming out with jim gaffigan, who i love, and in the episode i tell him about this joke i tried to do about, when you drop your dry cleaning off, you can go to any dry cleaner you want, but when you pick it up, you can only go to one. which i always thought was very funny, but nobody gets it.
hope all is well with you too! i don't do movies because i think generally the size of that content does not lend itself to great comedy; it lends itself to people saying, "hey, i made a movie." to me, the funniest things are shorter, so i think tv series or comedians in cars, i think i have a better chance of making you laugh.
i believe in detailed notes and jokes, and *also* winging it onstage. but, not for your first open mic. for your first open mic, my advice to you would be to make sure you have what you're gonna do memorized, to the point that one of your friends can gently slap you across the face, and you'll still be able to get it out of your mouth.
i think the best seinfeld episode idea i ever contributed was that george pretending to be a marine biologist would find kramer's golf ball in the blowhole of the whale. believe it or not, we were doing both of those stories without seeing any connection that kramer was gonna hit golf balls at the beach, and george was gonna be pretending to be a marine biologist. and it was in the middle of the week that it suddenly hit me of a way to connect the two stories. so, i think that's probably the best joke i ever thought of on the series. but, i love when people say "regift" or "giddyup", or "yadda yadda". the real and spectacular...i was a very big fan of the show.
our relationship is great. we have dinner, talk on the phone, and laugh as we always have.
believe it or not, this is something i think about a lot. i have often wondered if there's a way to teach being funny or comedy, and george stephanopoulos actually got me wound up enough at one point that we were going to contact, i think his name was lee bollinger, the president of columbia, and we were gonna go in there, and i was going to teach a course on comedy. because i know a lot about it, but i just don't know if it's teachable. i'm still wrestling with the idea if you can teach someone to be funny.
he did a 20 minute bit about stand-up at a school assembly once. heard it didn't go down too well.
we actually have just begun to entertain that idea. i'm kinda feeling like ccc should have that carson feeling of charles nelson riley coming on repeatedly, and it kinda becomes a little club that you have to get into. so yeah, i think we are gonna do it like that. it's never going to be six unknowns in a season.
there's tons of those. chaplain, george burns, george carlin, joan rivers... believe it or not, the idea has been explored to do some kind of cgi effect, using footage of dead comedians to get them in the car, and then we would write dialog around it. it was a total disaster, but you're not the first person to think of it!
right now i'm really binging on sebastian maniscalco, and brian regan.
i actually have quite a bit of it, and we're looking for a museum that wants to display it. i have the couch, i have the two blue stools, i have the table and chairs; the coolest thing i have is the door, which we never repainted in nine seasons. it has every scuff mark that kramer put on it with all those crazy entrances.
the best drive, of course, is the taconic, other then that anything in westchester off the main highway is pretty good. i just love driving honestly, i don't really care where i am.
least favorite...i once had a cadillac escalade in a very metallic beige, and the color made me sick. i liked the escalade, but a car must be in a good color, or it's useless.
i still say "hey" to greet a lot of people like we did on the show, and i still will do thumbs up, like kramer did. and i still say hello to people the way i said, "hello newman."
not jerry but... make yourself a schedule. bar exam starts at 8:00am, goes until noon, 1hr break, goes for 4 more hours. make that your study schedule. you're up at 6am, you eat breakfast, get dressed, go to the library and you're hitting the books by 8am sharp. you get your break at noon, then back to the books. getting yourself into those motions helps so much. otherwise you're going to be exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally during the bar.
that was the most fun i ever had. the coolest part of that episode, that you couldn't see, was the head of the secret service explaining to me what was going to happen if someone started shooting at us. what they would do to the president and where they were going to throw me in the back of a van. that was really exciting bourne identity stuff.
why are the memories more important to you than the show and the laughs? i think the laughs are the most important part. but if you prefer to just remember the laughs, then have the laughs. that's your business! i do often talk to the cast, but not as often as when we were doing the show. remember when you were in high school? remember those people? it's like that.
larry david and i discovered that we were both obsessed with superman and admired him and also found him very funny at the same time, so that is why he came up a lot. are you related to the hot dog kobayashi in coney island?
i don't think he did have serious health issues at that time. we certainly wouldn't have made all those death jokes if we knew that. but it was really wonderful that we got to be together that one last time.
i was just there for the one night to do my favorite thing in my life, which is standup comedy. you, on the other hand, have chosen to spend your entire life in reading, shouldn't i really be asking you what the hell are you doing in reading?
i considered it this spring for a solid six hours. there's a fantastic energy now for some reason, on the internet particularly. tumblr, people brought my attention to. i actually did consider it, but then i realized it would make bee movie 1 less iconic. but my kids want me to do it, a lot of people want me to do it. a lot of people that don't know what animation is want me to do it. if you have any idea what animation is, you'd never do it.
conan's remotes are already hilarious. but you'd need a big fucking car to fit him.
i'd let 90's julia louis-dreyfus playfully push me around.
first, that is not a correct usage for the word "iconic". advice cannot be iconic. the best advice i ever got was from rodney dangerfield, who when i asked him a question about something in comedy, just looked at me for a second and then went, "you'll figure it out."
jerry *fucking* seinfeld opens the door for you to pitch an episode of a show he stopped making almost 20 years ago, and you just leave him hanging?
i think jery get ipad, elane get iphone but kram get android tablet
i liked the ones that i was in. i felt i brought a certain something to it. i have a lot of favorite episodes. the pothole, the marine biologist, the yadda yadda, the soup nazi, the contest.
imagine if it were the episode where the gang is watching the "jerry" pilot on tv. it would be you watching you watching you.....
i had a similar, underappreciated, thought. i find it funny that a city will ticket a car over and over, basically saying "please move your car. please move your car." until one day they decide they no longer want you to move your car and they throw a boot on it.
i think a lot of comedy movies do tend to cause fatigue after enough jokes. an hour long standup special is probably the longest amount of straight comedy i can take.
getting sound advice from the legend himself, that is more valuable than you know. take this /u/magicsebi and run with it.
from the moment george says "the sea was angry that day, my friend" to the moment he holds up the golf ball is the funniest minute on television. i still laugh at that scene every time. thanks
my masters thesis for such a class would be to answer the age old question of whether superman, in fact, has a super sense of humor.
the david letterman ccc episode is my favorite and i'd love to see a followup with how he's doing since his show ended
it would be so interesting to have obama back once he's not president anymore. just to catch up with him, see how he's doing, what he's at.
that sounds like such an awful idea that i can't possibly believe anyone would seriously pitch it.
brian regan is the best. we see him every year. my husband laughs at nothing. but he cries at brian regan shows.
seeing parts of the set that i watched on tv would be quite surreal. i support this.
the taconic parkway is a dream to drive, especially in most of the cars featured on ccc.
i would say that's a good goal, but it really depends on your skills and personality. i put i a solid 6 hours of effort every day, which is a lot for me, with probably 2 or 3 hours of productive work. walked out of the exam an hour before the end and bought champagne to hand out to the later finishers. passed.
i'm a teacher and try to adopt the same policy for myself in the classroom.
i picture jerry like a little kid with this huge smile, eyes wide open, leaning in for more, saying things like "yeah? and then what? and what if they shoot over here? and do i get a gun?"
thanks for the reply, it was a fantastic show. and i actually drove in from philadelphia, that was my first reading experience and should be my last.
hmm. don't get why paul seemed annoyed. if you hire a comedian, like jerry said, you would know that it's not going to be a straight forward interview.
with the right comedic timing this joke could work really well
it was fun watching his form change and become more standard over time. he really got it down.
... i wonder how often people quote this, and other irritating lines at him?
the bit with george in the standing meeting was the best part of this. that was brilliant.
what's the deal with parking boots? they don't want you to park there, but then they make it so you can't leave! it's insanity!
one part of the seinfeld theme on the bass yeah (apparently there's like 3), just decided to google it for shits and gigs.
imagine how many takes there were over the years too. dude had a lot of practice. i wonder if he found himself at the time (or finds himself even today) accidentally entering rooms like that.
i saw one of seinfeld's shows about a year ago. at the end during his audience q&a, he called on somebody who just quoted a memorable line from his show. jerry basically lectured him (humorously, but very seriously), on how he doesn't find that funny in the least because it's his own joke from his own show, and it's been quoted to him so many times he just finds it annoying. and of course, the next person he called on said, "no soup for you!" and jerry just looked exasperated and said, "did you not hear what i *just* said?!"
there are people who have watched seinfeld at least 10-20 times and know it practically by heart.
the one i picture when i think of kramer. that kick is magic.
has there ever been a better physical comedy actor since? anyone even close?
fun fact, jason alexander nailed that speech in one take.
jerry often has that little smirk, i find, even in his show, where he's kinda laughing at his own jokes and / or the absurdity of the comedic situation... funny guy lol
it's like something you'd see out of old silent films, from a tumbler like buster keaton or something.
"when do i get my gun?" "that won't be happening" "not to worry, i brought my own, more efficient katana"
i heard that he is crazy, stupid rich today just because of the seinfeld riff. what would you bet that, somewhere in the world, one of his compositions is playing on a tv right now?
some of the funniest parts on that show are when you can tell one or all of them is about to crack. there's something so endearing and genuine about it - it makes you feel like you're a part of the joke.
you can hear george (jason alexander) bust a gut when elaine (julia louis-dreyfus) throws his toupee (fake hair) out the window in one episode
are you and your wife still together even after she found out about the robberies?
what's the most memorable thing that someone has said to you while you were bank robbing?
so do you keep your personal money in a bank? if so - which bank?
would you have harmed someone if you found yourself in a position between that and getting caught?
1) did you have a mentor of sorts that you learned from? 2) did you have a community of bank robbers that you would talk to? 3) if you could go back in time would you have still done it? 4) what do you do now for income? thanks! interesting ama!
what's the average amount of money you made from a bank ?
how much planing did you do before robbing a bank?
when you were robbing a bank was it intense or were you calm the entire time?
how was it the first time? it imagine it would be pretty scary. how did the police react when you turned yourself in?
this has to be one of my favorite ama's in a long time. 1) you never wore a mask or disguise so how did they not catch you on camera? did you know the placement of the cameras and how to avoid them? 2) did you ever get one of those ink cartridges that blew up on you and the money?? 3) what made you want to do the technique you used and not try to break into the bank and make a small fortune at one time and not have to do it again? 4) you said you met other bank robbers in prison, did any offer to do a job with you? did any share advice or how they did it? how i see it the "big dirty" would be tougher to execute but anyone that is convinced they can pull it off and is patient enough to study, watch, and learn the bank routine would be able to pull it off. but when you do multiple robberies for smaller amounts of money the risk of getting caught goes up with every bank and robbery. sorry for all the questions, stuff like this has always fascinated me.
friend worked at a bank. she said if they ever get robbed, to look at the robbers shoes. they change their clothes, but hardly ever change shoes. is that something you did?
i was listening to npr one day about a bank robber such as yourself. the guy spoke about how he would do it. the research, scoping out, very much like yourself where he went for the low risk, low rewards. and did it all on a bicycle. he finally did get caught after many years where he just got careless. he did mention some interesting things such as he targeted banks where it was relatively very close to police stations because it was highly likely that most patrols would be far away. do you find this true? did you also sometimes find it to be too easy and tend to get careless?
was it just for the money or something more than that?
:you say that you're retired. but i know a guy who is looking to put together a crew for a major job. this is the one you've been dreaming of all these years. are you up for one last job?
what made you want to do this ama? is it pride, warning?
could you walk us through the process? how did you choose a certain branch? was there a specific time of day that was best? any certain outfit/disguise? what did you say to the teller? where did you go after your escape?
do all bank robbers do it for the challenge like you did? i've always wondered why after they get away with a successful heist they continue and always get caught.
thanks for doing this, a couple questions for you. here's the part i don't understand: all the banks that i go to have a camera at the teller pointed right at the customers face. was something like this not in place at the time? additionally, did the tellers never put dye packets in with the money? last question: what about your getaway was different? in some of your answers you say you planned the getaway and not getting caught very thoroughly and you focus on the actual robbery itself in other answers, but not what happened once you walked out.
did the fbi seize the money you stole? or what happened to it all?
how was you not found out with cctv or anything without wearing a mask?
have you hurt or killed anybody during a robbery?
would you rather rob 100 duck sized banks or 1 bank sized duck?
what did you write on the paper when demanding the money? i find it hard to believe the bank worker would just say ok when you write down give me $1000. did you make threats?
what is your advice to a young man or woman looking to get his our her bank robbing career going?
no. we divorced while i was in prison for personal reasons not related to my crimes.
lmao. actually, yes. and they know about my criminal history because i went to high school with one of the girls that works at my bank. i keep a minimal amount of money in the bank for obvious reasons -- usually less than a thousand bucks or so. i actually think my account is pretty close to zero for now. bank of texas. :)
that depends on the situation. if it was just some random guy trying to be a hero, i would have probably gone to any extreme necessary to get away because that's a challenge. on the other hand, if it was a cop or a security guard of some sort, i would have probably let them win. probably.
no. i strapped a hammer to my leg under my pants just below my knee in case i needed to break out of a locked door or something, but i never used a gun or anything like that. prison was like church camp without the girls or weird counselors. i played a lot of chess and read a lot of books. i also wrote a lot, of course. mail is the highlight of anyone's day in prison. there are some pretty bad dudes there, but nobody really wants any trouble unless you just really fuck them over. there's always trouble if you want it, but it's pretty laid back most of the time. you learn the way of life pretty quick in there if you're smart.
yes. the last one i did. the teller freaked out as soon as i turned to leave the bank. she started screaming "lock the doors, lock the doors" but i ignored it and just kept walking like nothing was happening. i got out before the doors were locked, but a guy walking into the bank seconds later already found them locked. he was pissed, of course, because it wasn't closing time, and he thought he had gotten there too late. he obviously didn't realize the guy who had just walked out of the bank and past him had just robbed the bank.
1) only the internet. i studied countless reports of other robberies that had gone wrong and people who were caught. 2) no. i never told anyone what i was doing. one of the main things i learned from research was that an overwhelming number of people are caught because they didn't do it solo. so i never let anyone (not even my wife or best friend) know what i was doing. 3) yes. i still acknowledge what i've done, but the process and experience of going to prison and finding myself (as well as a purpose in life) has really made it all worth it, relatively speaking. it's hard to regret something that has turned into something so good. 4) i was working in the oil fields until recently. now i stay at home with my boys, and i am trying to get a book published and turn that into some sort of career, if at all possible. i've been on a few shows, and people seem genuinely interested in hearing more, so that's what i've decided to do.
sure. walked in the bank and waited in line like a regular customer. whichever teller was available to help me is the one i robbed. i simply walked up to them when it was my turn to be helped, and i told them -- usually via handwritten instructions on an envelope -- to give me their $50s and $100s.
not that much, honestly. probably around $5k per bank.
bank robbery is the real american dream. we make movies about it, and as long as innocent people aren't hurt or killed, our society loves bank robbers. also, it seemed like a worthy challenge. i thought it would be quite an accomplishment if i could solve the puzzle and figure out how to get away with it. i always figured prison was in the cards for me -- even before i was doing crime -- so it made sense to turn myself in and get it over with, but most of all, i became a father and wanted to just do my time while my son was a baby instead of the cops accidentally figuring out who i was and taking me to jail when my son was older.
it was scary the first time i tried, but i left and didn't do it. i returned the next day and wasn't scared. it's not really something you can do if you're afraid. fear gets in the way of clear thinking. the police were very professional. they sent the swat team to the hotel where i told them to come get me, so that was pretty shit-your-pants scary, but they didn't fuck me up or anything. once i was cuffed and cleared and all that crap, they all talked to me like i was a rock star or something. it was really strange. they asked "why" and all that stuff, but it wasn't like the cop style of "why." it was more like a fascinated curiosity.
[copied from another reply] basic outline: - stand in line like a regular customer - wait for the next available teller - hand them an envelope and tell them to give me their $50s and $100s (usually this was written on the envelope rather than me verbally saying it) - turning around and walking out like a regular customer no gun. no threats. no hollywood drama. no mask. no disguise. nothing. just a regular customer. in and out in the same amount of time as if i was making a deposit. ----- no dye packs. nothing like that. i never entertained any ideas from guys in prison who wanted to get together on the outside and do more banks. i did just fine by myself when i was still doing it, but i had also decided to quit for a reason. most guys in prison all did it the same way. the walked in with a gun and tried to be bonnie & clyde. ...which is how they ended up in prison.
no, i never worried about stuff like that because i was always long gone before the police got there anyway. and nobody ever saw what i drove because i would always park behind another building that you couldn't see from the bank.
could be true, but what about when an officer is heading back to the station for one reason or another and they hear a bank just got hit or happen to use that bank while they're on or just getting off duty? i'd be much more comfortable being far away from a police station if this was my line of work.
i eventually stopped counting. i originally fessed up to one bank, but they didn't believe me, so i gave them two more. i did time for those three.
[copied from another answer of the same question.] i always figured prison was in the cards for me -- even before i was doing crime -- so it made sense to turn myself in and get it over with, but most of all, i became a father and wanted to just do my time while my son was a baby instead of the cops accidentally figuring out who i was and taking me to jail when my son was older.
it was for everything but the money. it was fun, exciting, and addictive.
are we talking about getting four tons of gold from the union depository?
i wrote a book, and a friend of mine suggested that i do an ama on here because people apparently like this kind of shit. i wasn't so sure, and i figured i had nothing to lose in coming on here to see what people would like to know. ultimately, my purpose is to just tell the better part of my story about how i'm not the guy i used to be and that it's never too late to get your shit together and put your head on straight. i was a real piece of shit once upon a time, but i'm not anymore. i'm very happy with who i've become, and i'll do anything possible to reach those who are walking down the path that i walked down a decade ago. so if it's just q&a to a thousand people and i still reach that one person, then that's good with me.
basic outline: - stand in line like a regular customer - wait for the next available teller -hand them an envelope and tell them to give me their $50s and $100s (usually this was written on the envelope rather than me verbally saying it) - turning around and walking out like a regular customer no gun. no threats. no hollywood drama. no mask. no disguise. nothing. just a regular customer. in and out in the same amount of time as if i was making a deposit. i generally chose a time of day when i thought the cops were on shift change, which was usually around 3pm. some cities actually publish that for whatever weird reason. i usually went to chili's or somewhere to eat and chill out.
i think most first-timers do it out of desperation for their own personal financial problems, but career bank robbers -- in my opinion -- do it for the rush or the thrill rather than financial reasons. doing one successful heist just makes you feel that much more confident, and eventually people let their guards down and stop being careful like they were in their earliest crimes. for me, i treated every single one as the most important thing in my life, and i went to great lengths to make sure i didn't let myself get into a position to be caught.
if all you have is a picture or video of someone, that's not really useful. as long as i didn't make it to the news, i was good to go. and nothing i did was newsworthy because nobody got hurt and i didn't make a scene. no dye packs or anything like that. getaway was crucial. i only robbed banks that were in parking lots or something like that with other businesses around. i parked my truck out of view from the bank so nobody could see what i was getting into.
imagine you'd never met me or saw this ama (or anything about me anywhere). now imagine if they sent you the video of the bank jobs i did. would you be able to find me? :)
- give me all of your $50s and $100s - don't look at me - this is not a joke
as a retired prison chaplain, i'm really stoked about you sharing that prison was a time to reflect and work on yourself. this is was sort of my running speech back at the jail: you'll never get a better chance than this to do self-development. so many squander that opportunity, but a few really sink their teeth into it and end up living significantly different lives after they left. and that, i feel is more what prison ministry should be about, and less the actual religious part. may i ask if your enlightenment during incarceration had to do more vocation, or spirituality, or perhaps, i don't know, unresolved psychological issues?
'work on yourself' by doing what? getting fit and stuff?
plot twist: he robbed the bank of texas 3 times then took the stolen money back in a week later and opened an account with it
why did the tellers give you the money if you had nothing to threaten them with?
that teller might have lost her job for trying to be a hero.
that teller probably got fired. the last thing a bank wants is the robber locked in the bank. in your case there was no weapon but what does a robber with a weapon do in that scenario?
thanks for replying :) out of curiosity, did you ever feel that the concept of stealing money was wrong? i've heard some people argue that legal stealing is just protected stealing, so i wonder if your reason is similar. thanks!
if you're any good at writing you should definitely try writing a thriller book related to robberies, you have firsthand experience so it would actually be believable.
hm. doesn't sound like a whole lot. how much would one teller even carry?
was there a threat involved? or you just said "give me this money" and they did it?
i don't understand how this would work. why wouldn't they just tell you no? did you have a weapon or did the instructions threaten them? and if you didn't wear a mask, how did cameras never identify you? was this "back in the old days"?
so how much did you get away with in total with all the banks you robbed? how many banks did you rob? and how much did you have to pay the police or courts after your sentence?
i don't get how you didn't get caught. did they not have cameras in the bank?
did you use your normal car with your actual license plate? that seems extremely risky. i feel like it'd be better to use your car, but use a stolen license plate or something. then when you get a few miles away. stop and swap plates. obv driving with a stolen license plate for too long is stupid and could get your pulled over. but having your real plate seems super risky. if someone follows you to your car and gets the plate number, you're caught.
can you still get arrested for a robbery you didn't mention?
i still don't understand. sounds like no one was on your trail and you could have avoided arrest altogether. did you have another motivation - such as wanting to quit 'for real'? how did you turn yourself in? go to a defense lawyer first? seems like a very daring move - you could have gotten 20 years in prison for it. did you have any idea in advance how much time you would actually wind up serving?
honestly all this ama has done for me is make me want to rob banks with your template
how do you feel about doing this as a medium now to educate people and answer questions? more or less how do you like the questions and how does it make you feel to answer them? are you reminiscent?
what was your go-to, post-robbery meal at chili's? the triple dipper?
no. figuring out what the fuck was wrong with my head that made it where i couldn't function like normal people in society.
*hands note to teller: give me all your 50s and 100s and don't be fucking stupid. bitch.* *takes money* hi, thank you for your cooperation. i'd also like to open a savings account. *hands over drivers' license and ssn card*
you really think someone making barely more than minimum wage is going to bet their life on whether or not the person demanding cash has a gun?
she probably was fired. her doing that put the entire branch safety at risk. at least in the heat of a robbery, banks still consider human life worth more than money....or perhaps its just the bad pr of a customer hurt is worse than lost money...
i don't believe there is such a thing as legal stealing. you either steal or you don't. i'd be happy to respond to a specific scenario you're talking about, but as a general rule, i don't think it's wrong if two people willingly enter a contract even if one side benefits more heavily than the other. as for me, i think morality is very subjective. i wouldn't steal from an individual person because i'm not comfortable with that. the banks, however, consider this kind of theft an acceptable loss, so that was okay with me being part of the loss that they consider acceptable. part of my process did begin with how poorly i thought rich people handled their money. i'd always thought, "if i was that rich, i could change the world instead of just piling up cash." i don't use that to make bank robbery "okay" but that's what made it okay for me at the time.
in their top drawer, it was usually less than $10k. i probably averaged around $5k per bank. but it was pretty low risk that way, so that was cool with me.
no threat. i just told them what i wanted, and they complied. this is how it works in america because the amount of money a bank gives up ($5-$7k on average) per bank robbery is infinitely less than the amount of business they'd lose if shit got wild in a bank full of customers. they just want to give you what you want and for you to get the hell out of their bank.
my sister worked at a bank. they had pretty specific instructions to just do whatever a robber asked and offer no resistance at all. as far as a mask, maybe he had lemon juice on his face?
said he was in there 3 years, he timed it about right. this guy is a pro.
if zach snyder knows what's good for him, he'll recreate this in batman v. superman.
anything can be bait. i'm glad my institution is smarter then wells...we have our bait with our regular bills (not strapped or anything). if it gets handed out we void it and update it so not a huge deal. fun bait side story: so as a teller i got robbed one christmas eve. gave the guy what he asked for and the bait because that's what you do. off he goes. off i go. get a case update a week later. they got a trace on the bait. he used it to bail his girlfriend out of jail so they could be together. d'awww.
of course they had cameras. but then what? nobody knew me. what good does it know only having a face and basic description?
i agree on the "not really" part. :) but that was one of my nicknames in prison. i hated it.
right. i get the feeling reading this that i could walk into a bank, make a joke by asking for $5,000 and end up accidentally robbing a bank and not realize it until i'm at chili's.
put the money in the bag. put it in. will that be out of your checking or savings account? uh, savings.
how the fuck did you manage to come up with that cool line?
your blunt honesty is extremely refreshing, thanks for doing this ama.
it's not just that. if someone even slips you a note and tells you to give them money *or else* (you know, something threatening), the employee has to comply. in one of the robberies i've been in, the teller directly next to my window got robbed and i didn't even know until the robber was gone.
all of the money is insured, so being a hero and potentially getting people hurt is not advised.
thank you so much for explaining that! i'll let you get to your other questions :)
laundered is the word you're looking for. funny story: when i was a kid, i was renting a video game at hollywood video, and some of the money had gone through the wash so it was slightly damp. i also mixed up a $1 with a $10 and gave the guy way too much money. he looked at me and said "what, are you laundering money?" not knowing the difference, i chuckled and said yes, yes i was. his eyes got deadly serious and he said to me in a low, harsh voice, "because that's illegal."
what? i'm completely serious. i write screenplays, this guy has an interesting story, and i'd like to write it (if he's interested). he said that he's decided to offer folks a way of hearing more, and i could easily see an independent film being made with that goal in mind.
how is this low risk? i'm actually amazed you didn't get caught. what about cameras? or a description from the teller to the police?
sounds low risk. most interesting way of robbing banks i've ever heard. thanks for answering!
yup. i was a teller who was robbed an i got in trouble for pressing the trouble button before the robber had left. they didn't want the police showing up with the robber still in the bank.
how did you get away then? they would press some sort of alarm wouldn't they?
yeah, they trained us that if someone basically tells you that they're robbing you, even if you don't see a gun or some other threat, you're supposed to comply with them. they also told us to put in the dye pack, unless the robber specifically says something about not doing it.
i've worked a bunch of retail and in a lot of places we used to get similar instructions - if you get robbed, just give the person whatever they ask for and don't offer any resistance even if they don't seem threatening. mostly just because they're insured for loss through theft anyway, and you never really know how dangerous/crazy someone will turn out to be. much better to just file an insurance claim than to have to deal with an employee getting hurt or killed.
makes no sense. you don't need to know a person to identify them. so your description never made the local news? what's going on here.
i actually am a bank teller, and i can't believe you weren't caught on your first or second heist. did the banks you robbed not have the double security doors?
"not really" is a pretty cool nickname tbh. i wonder what's the shorthand for it
exactly this. he might have gotten away cleanly, but if he was concerned that he had a risk of getting caught further down the line, especially when he had a son, he'd rather "get it over with" so to speak. that and i'm told usually if you turn yourself in the sentences tend to be lighter.
i get the feeling that after this thread, there will be an exponential increase in non-aggressive bank robberies dealing with sums in the area of $5,000.
so the bank teller got caught and this guy didn't... lol
maybe he wants someone to make a movie about him and he's just helping them out with the tag line.
i save my dishonesty for when q&a's are not voluntary. :) and it's my pleasure. someone else suggested i do this, and i was skeptical, but it's actually a wee bit refreshing on my end, as well.
and that video store clerk... was quentin tarantino.
there are banks on every corner in america. all he has to do is drive a couple hours in any direction and no one would ever recognize him
really? i think the most interesting way is sitting inside the bank with hostages with three accomplices and fighting off cops while waiting for the thermal drill to get through the vault.
right now a ton of redditors are thinking up crazy ideas.
why bother with having a button then? just call 911 after.
yes, and they always did. button calls the alarm company. alarm company calls 9-1-1. 9-1-1 dispatches an officer. an officer speeds to the bank. i'm out the door before all that happens.
so robbing a bank is like arguing with a genie, if i'm specific enough with my instructions i'll get what i want?
so wait a minute. you're telling me that all i have to do to prevent getting painted, i just have to simply ask you not to put the dye pack in there?
no the new girl got it, along with ptsd and eventually breast implants. or so i'm told, i haven't been back in years.
stealing $5000 is pretty unlikely to make local news, in major metro areas several people commit that magnitude of theft every day... and if nobody ever sees a gun, nobody is actually individually harmed, and nobody is driven to a panic, then it isn't a huge story. if you drive to a different metro area to commit the crime in, even a photo on the news several nights in a row isn't going to be much help. crime shows give you a weirdly skewed perspective, where they have all of these resources and always catch people. in reality, security camera footage only really helps you next time you see them. you can show it to people hoping for recognition, but even then, even if people know the suspect, many people will not recontextualize this nice guy they know to see him as a bank robber, or, if they can, will not turn him in.
i almost got caught in those doors on my last one. i got out within seconds of them locking them. i was very fortunate.
honestly i would have done it just to save me from paranoia. fuck a life of hiding and worrying.
it's almost as if that textbook is somewhat grounded in what real situations tend to be and not just totally made up. :)
that's fucking hilarious though. bank robber helps a bank catch an employee... robbing the bank.
did you tell them they had the amount wrong specifically to get someone in trouble? if not, why?
i feel like he's doing an ama for a fictional character he wrote but he's still working out the details.
well the bank teller wasn't a professional bank robber.
could anything you say here come back to bite you? you say you only admitted to a few robberies to the police but you admit to dozens now. are the rest beyond the statutes of limitations or something?
when i was in high school my friend and i would go over to our local movie rental store after school because of this quirky guy who worked there who seemed to have this insane encyclopedic knowledge of all things cinematic. he would give us obscure recommendations for films no one had ever heard of but that he had in stock. they were always homeruns for a couple stoner teenage chuckleheads like us. the other thing he would tell us which we just chalked up to him having lofty dreams was about the scripts he was writing. this being southern california we weren't too impressed. sure sure who *hasnt* written a script, man? my old babysitter wrote a script. bfd fast forward some years later the script turned out to be reservoir dogs. our weird, eccentric but genius video store clerk buddy over at video archives in manhattan beach (now gone) was quentin tarantino. dare to dream.
wow, so you pretty much relied on the rules banks tell their employees? that's pretty insane.
you'd think with all that money they stole they could afford a drill that doesn't break every 10 seconds but apparently not.
yeah but i estimate none are actually going to do anything we're armchair bank robbers
and then it comes back to bite you in the ass later, just like a real genie wish should.
it really is true, you just have to walk up there and ask for money in some way that implies a robbery, and a teller is supposed to comply. robbing a bank isn't hard, getting away with it is.
lol, well the dye pack is not kept with the regular cash, in case you accidentally set it off. so you have to somewhat go out of your way to get it from another drawer. if the thief is smart, he's watching you do this. they told us to try to give it to him if it doesn't pose some kind of threat. so i was just using an example, if the guy is pointing a gun at me as i empty my drawer, and he says "don't put the dye pack in", i'm sure as fuck not going to make him even think i'm doing that. this was at one specific bank over 15 years ago, i'm sure different banks have different procedures, and that technology probably got better too.
yup. people break into cars in my apartment lot all the time, been happening for years. people cried about getting cameras, so the strata got cameras (which we all got to pay for....). robberies have not slowed down, nobody has been caught, afaik the cameras serve only to deter potential crime and they aren't even working for that.
at the bank i work at, we tend to be pretty specific about people we even let in the bank, but this is a very small bank where we know customers in a first name basis. p.s. i probably shouldn't be telling an ex-bank robber this, but bank employees can't legally hold people between the doors because we can be charge with kidnapping.. i know it sounds ridiculous, but it's 100% true.
i'm a financial advisor and that technique of having someone self identify their own limits of knowledge is a great method.
assume the swallow is in the shape of a sphere with negligible air resistance.
i wouldn't have guessed she took it. i was just particular about the facts being straight. if i was going to fess up to that shit, it was going to be perfect and accurate.
boom- i think that might be it. something seems off.
seems like the way to go, i mean you could be carrying a weapon, simply walking in and asking for all the money will almost certainly get you it. even if it's small, the risk of someone getting shot at a bank is not worth it, you'd rather be the bank that handed some dude 10k than the bank where your teller got someone killed.
though that would be a funny to explain to the cops. "i just asked very politely, i was quite surprised they handed me the money"
nowadays they have dye bags right next to the regular bags. the bag opening after the switch being set on is what triggers it now. so that's why i asked. now that you mention it being 15 years ago, that makes more sense. but today, it's easy to fool the robber.
any more information or link to articles on this method of forcing self identifying limits?
so the bank and fbi hadn't previously watched that video?
former teller here. i made all of $10/hour. i'll hand you every penny in every drawer if you just ask with a stern voice. that money isn't mine, i don't care if you have it, just please don't hurt me.

hello ms. kim. i enjoy your twitter posts and found your guardian piece comparing the political chaos in korea to the u.s. very enlightening. in your experience, what are the biggest misconceptions americans have about either north or south korea?
is it true that crystal meth and cannabis use is widespread both rurally and in urban environments? if so, could you describe your experience of this phenomena?
how long did it take between the time you had this idea and actually going through with it? (apologies if you covered that in the book, it's been a while since i read it.)
how much did u make as a teacher? easy thing to get into (teaching english in n korea)? last one - any dangers associated with just teaching in n. korea?
are north koreans allowed to speak english in pyongyang?
in '92-93 i taught english in prague in the czech republic. eastern europe had just been opened up from the communists. the sense of euphoria among the people was palpable. hope exuded from everyone. i taught businessmen and women who for the first time in their lives had freedom for their entrepreneurial spirit. they came to me every day with hopes and bottles of champagne. i'm curious about the demeanor of your students. i cannot imagine 'hope' was anywhere around. how can one teach without hope? thx and best wishes.
what was the best thing you've eaten in north korea?
what use do they have for english if they never get to leave?
the most unexpected thing is that we are somehow conditioned to think of north korea as very simple. as in people are hungry & poor & brianwashed. then rich are like kim jong un & his friends all partying and eating & drinking. not true. my students were the sons of elite, the creme de la creme of north korea, but they were under the most strict control every second of the day. they had not been anywhere, outside their country certainly but also within their country, and they didn't know anything, their education thus far seemed to have been totally bogus and built only around the great leader. they had no freedom of any kind. sure, they were of course better off than the rest of the country that suffers, famine-striken etc., but the elites also live under fear. what i am trying to say is that it's not black and white. the control / abuse happens on all level. basically they are all victims. the entire country is a ladder / web of abuse and control.
they had no choice. this was what they were ordered to do, and they studied so diligently because they were obedient. it is a culture where they have to listen to the authorities. but little by little, they would show some frustrations. they found it hard. their dictionaries were outdated, which translated korean words to english, and they didn't like to use english dictionaries for definition. they found different accents by the teachers (many were missionaries from deep south, with the southern accent, or from new zealand etc) difficult to understand. but these were just practical difficulties. their real feelings about having to learn them? they couldn't really show it. they just felt worried that they were spending all their time learning english when their majors were within the field of science and technology
there were so many things. they just learn totally upside down information about most things. but one thing i think most people do not realize is that they learn that south korea & us attacked north korea in 1950, and that north korea won the war due to the bravery of their great leader kim il sung. so they celebrate victory day, which is a huge holiday there. so this complete lie about the past then makes everything quite illogical. because how do you then explain the fact that korea is divided still, if actually north korea "won" the war? one would have to question that strange logic, which they do not. so it's not so much that they get taught lies as education, but that that second step of questioning what does not make sense, in general, does not happen, not because they are stupid but because they are forbidden and also their intelligence is destroyed at young age. there were many many examples of such.
i kept them all on usb sticks which i kept on my body at all times. i erased the trace off my computer every single time i signed off. i also created a document within a document so that my notes looked like a school material. i also created a back up copy on sd card which i hid in secret places in the dark, with the light off, just in case there were camera in the room.
generally it's the same. yes, the accent is different & they have some phrasings and words that are different or feel quite old fashioned or war-related vocabularies, but in general the difference is almost regional where one has that in south korea from region to region also, but when you are talking about the basic exclamation you cite, (when bumping into things or surprised) they are pretty much not that different.
i don't know why but this question is really funny
only those texts allowed in china. all that was pre-approved by the north korean authority. i tried to install my own methods of essay writing and letter writing to investigate what they are really thinking, but that was not a part of the official text, but i insisted and got them approved by the north korean authority called "counterpart".
yes, frightening every second. not because i was in pyongyang, but because i was taking notes / writing the book in secret. for average people who visit pyongyang for whatever organizational reason (that is not a place for a personal curiosity visit since it's basically a gulag positing as a country), it would not be frightening since everything's so controlled.
you know. . .i don't really know. i could give all the usual answers how i was so tortured by the injustice there - which is true - and how i felt horrified watching so many separation that happened to families, including my own - which is also true. but the answer is a far more complicated one. so i recently wrote a long essay on this very topic for lapham's quarterly, which should be coming out any day now. so i will tweet that out when the piece comes out. i think it has something to do with fear. how that society is built on fear, and how fear can dictate us, and how we try to fight that fear in life. . .i know it's maybe a bit nonsensical in this ama answer format, for which i apologyze. . .but the more accurate answer would be that i jumped in there because it was the most scary place in the world for me. . .if that makes any sense.
the average citizen is unlikely to have any access to the "outside world" on a day-to-day basis. however there are smugglers that bring sd cards, cds, etc. into the country with forbidden material on it such as western/south korean movies and kpop.
i am always torn between the two genres. but if i really had to choose, i guess my heart is with fiction. but nonfiction makes my brains flow perhaps in a really exciting way. and my nonfiction in general is literary that i get my fiction angst/fill through that way. i don't know which i "like" writing better. writing is so torturous for me that it's only after finishing it or nearing the end that i can enjoy it:) no, i do not consider myself a korean-american literature writer. that genre is an odd one for fiction writers. i guess one cannot help that in coming up with genres, but especially fiction, to be limited by my nationality or immigration history is uncomfortable. i guess i just want to be a "writer", period. yes, the interpreter -- so many years later, i myself still have a real soft spot for suzy park, so thank you.
i think the biggest misconception goes back to the basic premise. most americans have no idea why there are two koreas, or why there are 30,000 us soldiers in south korea and why north korea hates america so much. that very basic fact has been sort of written out of the american consciousness. by repackaging the korean war as a civil war, it has now created decades of a total misconception. the fact that the us had actually drawn the 38th parallel that cut up the korean peninsula, not in 1950 (the start of the war) but in 1945 at the liberation of korea from japan is something that no korean has forgotten -- that was the beginning of the modern korean tragedy. that the first great leader (the grandfather of the current great leader) was the creation of the soviet union (along with the us participation) is another horrible puzzle piece that americans have conveniently forgotten.
i dont know about cannabis, but i have heard from several sources that meth use is common as it is much cheaper than food, easing stomach pain from starvation, as well as provides energy for a long and tiring work day. i would also like to know the ops comments on this and if its true.
the whole idea for the literary nonfiction on north korea came in february 2002 when i first went to pyongyang for the 60th birthday celebration of kim jong il & wrote the nyrb cover essay. i realized then that an essay was just not enough, and there was just so much more i felt about this topic, also given my family background etc. from then on, it was trying to study the topic as thoroughly as i could, by literally researching it from afar and close, i.e. following defectors through the defection route, interviewing separated families, and situating myself in places where i could either go to north korea or learn more in-depth stuff about it. even my fulbright research grant which allowed me to live in seoul for 14 months in 2009 was for this book. as well as each visit that allowed me to get a different perspective. understanding it from all sides was a key, and i felt that i had exhausted that by the time i lived there in 2011. so all in all, i would say about a decade.
it was an unpaid job. i believe every teacher was sponsored by their church. there is not a danger in teaching in north korea, but this is a gulag nation, and america is their enemy, and there is no diplomatic relations between them, so if you are a teacher from the us, then, yes you are in danger, as evidenced by the recent hostage crisis where two american detained by north korea (currently still held there) are from the university where i taught.
i wasn't there to teach, so that was not what i was looking for. my students were so busy, every hour of their day was mapped out, so it leaves no time for thinking. i found that world to be without hope. that does not mean that there is no joy in moments. there are because human beings are resilient, and my students were very, incredibly humane and lovely and their youthful spirit was sparklingly beautiful. but there was no real time for them to celebrate any of it. they would relax a bit but the immediately hauled off to their many duties that all had to do with regime & great leader. there was no hope there. so i wrote down what i saw. but i do not know about other teachers who were there to teach, but if you read my book, you will see that the other teachers weren't mostly there to teach but there as a part of their fundamental evangelical missionary purpose.
learning the language of the enemy could probably get you recruited as a spy, allow you to do business overseas for the regime, etc.
is this a legitimate subreddit? people always joke about being banned from it so i've never been able to tell if it's serious or comedic.
are there higher "elites"? there must be a level higher who these people fear?
i know the term orwellian gets used probably more than it should, but i can't help notice the similarities between what you describe and 1984's party members (similar to the elite you describe), and 1984's prole population (rest of the country).
did you spend all of your time using english? i presume you speak korean, were you allowed to use it with your students? or was that discouraged? how proficient were your students with english by the age of 19 or so? had they been learning since early childhood? how were they chosen for this education stream?
why do they learn english? what purpose does that serve a country that gets no access to native english speakers?
well if the premise is that north korea was attacked, then you can say you "won" if you beat back the invaders and made them retreat back to the original borderline.
another crazy belief they have re: that war is that they retreated after the inchon landings because the great leader saw the suffering of the people and fell back.
well you could say that finland won the winter war against the soviet union / russia, even though we "lost". we managed to keep our country at least. i count it as a win.
oceania was at war with eastasia: oceania had always been at war with eastasia.
"their intelligence is destroyed at young age." that really hit me hard, for some reason. it's utter child abuse and neglect to refuse to develop a child's intellect and to deny any rational thought whatsoever is sacrilege.
history is written by the victors - unless you cut off all contact with them.
south korea used to do that too. i was in primary school in south korea in the 80s during chun doohwan's presidency/dictatorship, and i remember being taught that south korea won the war. i guess both capitalist and socialist dictatorships are similar in that sense.
oh great, now the next undercover journalist can't use those anymore because you just answered north-korean spys question!
my assumption is there were no cameras.... even the cheapest indoor cameras have ir night vision. you could have been caught easily here, darkness won't defeat a camera.
next time you should encrypt your data. it is really easy, you can use winzip or 7zip and create and encrypted archive. they are secure enough, surely enough for north korea.
it sounds like all of north korea is one big religious cult. does religion have any role in controlling people there? if so, how?
not op, but the weirdest thing i've seen is my dog headbutt my cat which made my cat puke, which my dog ate, then puked. i had to clean that up.
i remember watching that! they walked into a computer lab and everyone just had a search engine open and they weren't doing anything. however *the one person* they wanted the basket ball players to meet *was* doing something but it was really insignificant. i think they remarked that it felt like people were waiting just for visitors and just to go through the motions of whatever role they were supposed to be playing.
in my time spent in korea in the army, we have katusas, south koreans attached to army squads for interpreters in case shit goes down. whenever we did something to impress them or they like something they would all always in unison go ohhhhhhhhh.....always made us army dudes smile
was there the risk of your personal notes and documents being taken? how did you write the book?
that got me very curious about reading your book :). our perception of lies in "western" society is that they are bad because they do not represent reality, its a way of geting advantage of a situation by misleading someone to make them agree with something they did not. to them its their lives and part of their reality, besides the real world they create an abstract reality where they can dream and experience things that arent real, at least for a moment. its part of how you explore your mental faculties, how you experience your life (fantasysing or not) so at that moment he is living temporarily exploring a world that doesnt exist, not betraying your trust by telling a history that didnt happen, misleading you. it's like reading a book to you. reality and dreams become heavily tied. after all, their lives are heavily based on that. their perception of reality includes a virtual world, where he can temporarily experience something, just like a memory.
also note: watching foreign movies caries a death sentence.
just thinking about what it would be like to be north korean and get stuff from the 'outside' world is fucking crazy. the shit we produce is top quality it must be like xmas for them
would you rather it be called fake news or lies and propaganda. because as a military journalist, id rather it be called lies and propaganda. i feel like fake news is just changing the name to make it palatable.
why did the allies divide korea to begin with? did the soviets/chinese have soldiers there during wwii?
anyone know where can i find information regarding how the first great leader was a creation of the usa & soviets? i'd love to read about it
not 100%, but i'm pretty sure cannabis is completely legal there, just growing on the side of roads freely, not considered a drug. these buds would be seedy though, no good by any means. you probably wouldn't want to have the munchies there anyway..
thanks - one last one for clarification and one more out of curiosity. 1. so as a canadian, teaching there should be relatively safe. 2. i feel i've seen people get in trouble for proselytizing. why are all teachers organized through a church if they're against religion? ... think i'm missing something.
what are those duties filling every day of a student in the pretty empty north korea?
if they weren't allowed to discuss or mention christianity, how could they perform missionary duties?
the thing that bothers me about these facts is that ostensibly we knew that the conditions in north korea were like this even after 9/11, we knew then that they hated us, and even then they would make nuke threats directed toward us; and yet bush took us to war in iraq, a country that was not a direct threat to us, under numerous false pretenses. even in 2003 when i was 21 i was puzzled by why we were targeting iraq and pretty much ignoring north korea.
they could also fear those near their social position too. not necessarily higher. people lower or lateral to their position might compromise them to improve their own position.
my guess is that it'd go all the way up to the top (esp. with kim jong-un doing stuff like offing that one high-up uncle of his--no one is safe, not even family), and then even kim jong-un doesn't live fearlessly because his direct underlings are probably constantly trying to reposition themselves and would likely get rid of him & take power themselves if such an opportunity presented itself
she said in her book that she was not allowed to speak a single word of korean to her students, which makes sense really. people who have been to nk have said that the minders speak the language (english speakers mind americans, german speakers mind germans, and so forth) virtually flawlessly. she taught the children of the elite, and the elite get certain advantages there.
evangelical missionaries. them fuckers & mormons are the only people you can convince to go to places like north korea or the middle of the congo willingly.
you're forgetting that they also believe themselves to be the most powerful nation on the planet. this dichotomy they push of being the single greatest (unbeatable) superpower in history along with the fact that this county only succeeded so far as to merely push the invaders back is where the logic would still fall apart.
which still coincidentally is called the same name as their home country? i understand that north korean's call it the dprk, but still, the name could still cause question.
that seems to be the last of their worries, but also a horrific strategy if you want to succeed in the long run. do they not see this immediate benefit as a long term handicap??
it would be wrong to call nk socialist in any sense of the word. absolutely no worker holds control over their place of work or any means of production, and socialism is built out of democracy and consensus decision making. nk can best be described as an authoritarian state capitalist country
you can see ir light with your own camera. try using an ir remote and look at it via camera. heat cameras are loud and expensive and big. not good for covert surveillance and glass is not transparent.
it is a totalitarian atheist regime, religion (other than worshipping the kim family) is forbidden and will get you arrested and possibly tortured. the school she taught at is actually run by american christian pioneers but they are not allowed to teach or talk about christianity.
they wouldn't let you take pictures of it. out of respect.
no, that must be some other waxwork of kji in a mao suit on a beach with an umbrella.
i've always wanted to go. the trip i booked months before just happened to coincide with shit hitting the fan.
that is an exceedingly amusing image, thank you. this shall serve as a nice substitute for op's reply.
lol the chinese do this exact same thing in hong kong!
to make it look like north korea was doing well to a foreigner. he could go shopping and that was impressive to show
only if the us and south korea agreed in advance to actually take full responsibility for "freeing" the people there.
to gain some insight into that question, you could ask iraqis today whether they are happy that the us "liberated" them from the tyranny of saddam hussein.
until they get caught watching one if our movies then get sentenced to death.
this is what is so frustrating to me. 'fake news' has been around since humans could talk. people embellish, people tell vague truths, people straight up lie in everyday life. to call actual reporting and investigative journalism 'fake news' is so disingenuous. and even more, to haphazardly call straight up lies a particular media/state organization puts out 'fake news' completely takes away from the severity of lying to the public. people in power have always done it and will continue to do it, but the sudden rise of shrugging off lies as just 'fake truth' is frightening.
military journalism is to journalism what military music is to music.
that would be taking it out of the context to claim that first great leader was "created" by us. he was a soldier (protege of the soviet), while us participated in that set up handpicking the us educated south korean first president. us had drawn the 38th parallel, and that division was trumpeted by the cold war, two separate gov't formed by 1948 & war broke out in 1950. that is a very simplified version of the history of the two koreas which most americans don't remember and now wonder why they are in south korea today and why is north korea mad at them. if you are genuinely curious, there are many many books on this topic by serious historians.
in her book, she sees them do all kinds of things, from guarding the juche study hall to trimming the lawn with scissors. make-work, to eliminate free time.
i know people like to call everything orwellian, but this mutual accountability system sounds pretty similar. you have good cause to fear your peers and subordinates.
look at how merciful and just the great leader was! at any time he could crush them!
but the dprk is the legitimate government. it's those traitor south koreans who call themselves the republic of "korea" in an attempt to legitimize their rebellion.
not if their power depends on it. an educated population is significantly harder to govern. it's not that uncommon a strategy, they just take it to an absurd extreme.
i'm really getting tired of seeing people try to label north korea when the fact of the matter is that there is no modern analogue for it. not socialism, not communism, and most *certainly* not capitalism. the closest analogy would be to a medieval feudal society, albeit one based around a cult of personality. there's never really been anything quite like it.
flir thermal cameras that you can attach to your phone are now in the couple hundreds of dollars. so while moderately expensive, are far from unattainable
the tech they allow the citizens to have is, but the elites have whatever they want from china.
those are some brave people, talk about practicing what you preach.
what kind of torture? can you list out a couple of methods that the north koreans use?
all that matters is that it made it to your spank bank.
i can't tell if this is sarcasm or a ridiculous number of waxworks...
fun! admittedly nk has been on my list for awhile. caribbean cruise? nah, gimme that oppressive regime. it just seems so much more interesting/exciting.
did you feel nervous there? how was the water park? was there many people there swimming?
do you mind telling us how you went about organizing such a strange vacation? where does a random individual even start?
in japanese it's usually uwa and in chinese it's wa. no, these are not made up words. it's essentially their version of 'wow'
i see her explanation more like they lie day to day as a weird sub-level form of communication. it was a lie with no motive, as she said, "not of a 19 year old boy, but a child". you know how habitual liars will lie when they don't need to? seems it was like that, but it was more a part of their culture. like they enjoyed manipulating each other's perception or reality, either to keep others smart and to spot the smart ones out, or maybe its just dumb culture stuff. i bet it has a social purpose though (this is my interpretation, because of how she describes the lying)
their natural resources will certainly be liberated, that's for sure
that almost sounds like something out of a horror movie.
might be too late but were there maybe similarities between what was done with korea and what was done with germany? did we basically split influence with the soviets to avoid immediately starting another war on the heels of wwii this time with a frenemy we were struggling to work with to sort out europe?
if you read the blogs of the people who visited nk as tourists in multinational groups you get the sense that various different races/nationalities are treated quite differently. americans, particularly korean/asian americans are just the most closely monitored and vetted of all, which is what makes ops experiences so crazy.
might need an /s tag there, this is the internet after all
yeah, that's exactly a 100% proper example of something being orwellian. the members of the party were under much stricter surveillance than the proles as well, so it's similar in a few ways.
you have been made supreme moderator of r/pyongyang.
agreed, nk is not a dictatorship either. the premise behind a dictatorship is that the dictator came to power through his own actions. the last 2 leaders of nk have inherited their power. noel korea is a " serfdom society ruled by an absolute monarch."
even the nk elite's tech is from the 80s. china doesn't want to give updated military or surveillance equip to a country hellbent on destroying all the other ones around them, possibly including china
mostly starvation in concentration camps, as far as i can recall. couple dozen folks have managed to get access the china border. they occasionally talk about being so hungry they took a pickaxe to frozen human waste looking for undigested food.
i swear the seagulls are to the right. the beachball might be imaginary. there's something else ridiculous though. i could't take a picture, so this is from memory from the 9th or of april.
i wanted to go because i've always thought of nk as a miniature china frozen in time of the late 60s (admittedly less so now than 5-10 years ago). need to see it for myself before shit hits the fan. my parents weren't as thrilled at the idea however, because nk today reminds of them of their childhood.
not really nervous, no. as u/swboards said, i'm not a retard. and i'm not american or korean or a journalist, so basically nothing has happened to a person in my demographic since the korean war. and the waterpark is full of chinese tourists and the nk elite. it was alright. everything is weird there: the buildings you go to are mediocre, or 'just renovated', but still somehow seem like they're 35 years old. the decor and design of the waterpark seemed like it was from the early eighties, but it was built or renovated in (i think) 2013.
i never understood the goal of the party in 1984, it seemed like it was just an incredibly tight and efficient power control at first but as it went on it seemed like they controlled and oppressed entire countries for the sadistic fuck of it. even the most brutal and oppressive regimes like the nazis or stalins soviets had some kind of ideological originality. but the party in 1984 seems to be oppressive for the sake of being oppressive
as an ex cult member the lies are easy once you're used to them. you repeat lies because those around you expect you to. if you deviate then you get ostracized or in some cases like nk, killed. lies become reality. waking up from that, for my wife and i, was an insane process. the freedom you experience afterwards is like nothing else. after awhile you don't even realise they're lies or even if there are questionable things you are saying. you keep saying them because if you don't you lose your family, friends, way of life, social network, job, lifestyle, business contacts etc. it's like formatting a hard drive and starting over. you're still the hard drive but nothing previously recorded to it is relevant any longer. it's a crazy experience. i wish i had the aptitude to write about cult experiences, i just don't. i'll tell you though, it's a mind fuck and if you're in a cult you don't know you are until you're out. which is why telling someone they are in one doesn't work.
pretty sure anyone who knows the slightest bit of history can tell i'm being sarcastic.
we aren't talking about military tech. we're talking cheap surveillance stuff you can buy at walmart.
former tibetan buddhist monk just popping in to say it's most definitely a religion - even the pared down and simplistic zen form. casual western tourists would never get exposed to the more supernatural side in just a day at a monastery somewhere. but all buddhism is buddhism - and it has gods, death practices, celibate and ordained clergy (not all sects), sacraments, prayers and meditative practices, etc.
i reas a book about someone who escaped their camps and escaped to china and he said (apart from the starvation) that women were raped, some guards threatened to kill the baby in their womb, that there wasn't much sleep but hard labor instead and that everyone had to spy on everyone to get a few grains of rice...and the person who escaped was hung over fire and burned forhours, i don't remember for what exactly. also, if you escape, they kill all your relatives and their children or put them into cocentration camps too.
reminds me of east berlin when i visited as an exchange student to west germany back in 1985.
i read somewhere that the disparity between nk and sk is six times greater than wg and eg ever were. (i don't have a source on that because i'm lazy and don't want to be wrong).
well, that makes sense. south korea is as modern as any country in the world, and north korea is worse off economically than east germany ever was.
hi adam - what was one myth that you were sure deep down in your heart was true but that you had to admit was false after you guys put it to the test?
hi adam, i normally miss when these are happening so i'm glad i caught this one. is there any myth you've heard that you would never want to try to bust?
one thing i always wondered while watching mythbusters. was there ever a reason you only ever wore all black?
what's the one experiment that you've always wanted to do but haven't been able to due to production restrictions (oh&s, budget .etc)?
adam, just wanted to say, i'm a huge fan of tested, and i deeply appreciate the level of detail you guys showcase on the channel. and i love seeing your toys ;) question: with current education standards, do you believe that there are gaping holes where kids are missing out on creative experiences? making, building, etc. what would you like to see implemented in to our education systems? (not just in the bay area, but in low income communities)
hey adam! thank you doing this ama. i was just wondering what is the memorable time you've met a fan on the street?
what would you say are the most important skills to learn for model and prop making? what would old adam tell yourself at a younger age that would have helped out the most?
hey adam! now that robotwars is back, do you plan to try and participate again?
is there still a place to submit myth ideas online? the only place i could find looks like it was last updated in 2012. hope this gets to you because my myth would be what would happen if a human swam out into the bellagio fountains and was on top of one of the jets of water. would he fly up with the water and die? would the water cut right through him creating a giant hole? or would he escape unharmed? edit : found the thread in /r/mythbusters to submit and submitted this.
hi adam, how do you feel about programs like first and vex? do you think they're eventually going to be successful in the cultural revolution they're trying to reach?
hi adam! is it true that you and jamie don't get along that well?
hi adam, how successful was the "reboot"? is discovery happy? are you happy? what will the future of mythbusters look like?
my sons are huge fans of the show and would like to know how many things you've blown up over the years? how did you manage to get barack obama on the show?
is it true that jamie is stronger than an orangutan?
hi adam, first off, thanks for doing an ama, you and mythbusters is probably one of the main reasons i got into robotics and engineering. as for my question, what is the hardest thing you've ever done on the show that was either dangerous or difficult?
hi adam, thanks for doing the ama. i just have a short question. i met you last year at the ubc alumni event in vancouver and i gave you a pyramid shaped puzzle box that i built, were you able to solve it and find out what is hidden inside? thanks!
greetings, adam! what is your favorite child-friendly movie and tv show (besides mythbusters)?
hey adam! i once got into an argument with a friend of mine who said *mythbusters* was very unscientific. it lasted over an hour and ended up being one of the most heated argument i've had in my adult life. what would you say to someone who says the show isn't scientific?
hi adam, i'm going to graduate soon with a bachelor's in physics and mechanical engineering. i just wanted to say thank you for showing me and countless others how incredibly awesome science can be. my favorite part of mythbusters was always the critical thinking. when i was younger i had no idea how much power the human mind is capable of producing, and unlocking that potential is something i can never thank you enough for. my question for you: what do you think will be a bigger factor shaping the next 20 to 50 years, nanotechnology or 3d printing?
hi adam! my daughter and i absolutely adore your show, and we watch it together every day. she is completely ecstatic that today is her birthday and she gets to ask you a question! "what is your favorite kind of cake? i'm having a science birthday and i want to have adam cake!" (she's 3)
adam, as a young man starting out in the world (going to college next year), i have a huge love of building things, testing, and a passion for anything diy. when you were starting out, how did you fund your projects or get materials for what you need? i've loved mythbusters for a long time, and i remember watching a speech you gave at a maker fair once on youtube. thank you!
hey adam! as another sf bay area resident, just wanted to say i love seeing you guys roam all over the bay! is there any sf bay area location you'd like to visit for the show that you haven't yet?
what are you most looking forward to at comiccon this year? been a huge mythbusters fan since episode 1 btw :)
hey adam, what is your hands-down, of-all-time favorite edc knife? and what is jamie's favorite edc knife?
1. are you both time traveling archaeologist trying to understand pop-culture who somehow broke their device to travel through time and are stuck in the present trying to gather the materials to complete your device? 2. does jamie have a special document saying he is protected from seal hunting? 3. which con will you be going to next? 4. how has the imgur/reddit community treated you and what are your impressions of either? 5. do you guys get random visits from fans time-to-time? 6. if so and if its allowed, may i drop by :d? 7. i have this replica western pistol (peacemaker design) thats made with metal and has working mechanism but i cant take it to cons for obvious reasons. im thinkg of making a mold of it, making a lead core, and then casting a plastic remake, what do you think? 8. which myth did you dislike the most?
why isn't mythbusters on netflix anymore, and when it is, why are the seasons "collections" and not chronological?
hi adam! i loved your commentary track for brazil! any plans for another one? (also i know a tested member sent in a gundam model kit after the video of you and norm painting the cosmonaut kits. i hope you get a chance to paint it! your take on a giant mech would be awesome)
hello mr. savage, my question to you is: where does one begin when wanting to dive into the world of special effects?
did you ever test the giant flying frisbee myth? whether it's possible to scale a frisbee to the size of a spaceship?
hello adam, thanks for both mythbusters and tested. you guys got me back into "reading" again with recommending "the martian". and i'm listening to "seveneves" right now while building stuff! you are a great inspiration and have been a big part in making me realise how much i love creating physical things (i'm a programmer by trade). question: i'm from the eu, and as the rest of the world we use the si-system of measurement where everything is based on 10. with the imperial system instead there are a lot of 3/4", 12/16" and such, which is a total mind bender at least for me. do you think this creates a more intuitive sense of division when being forced to use such measurements, or is it just a set of mnemonics that makes you understand it all?
thanks for coming by adam! always great to see you do an ama on here! i've been a fan for as long as i can remember and just love watching the show. i also love watching you guys do all those cool things on the tested youtube channel. so, my question to you is: what character would you most like to dress up as at comic con, but feel like the costume would be too far fetched to make? or is nothing too far fetched for you? also, got any hints are what your costume will be this year?
i have a myth question: what would happen (besides total destruction) if a hole was cut straight through exact center of the earth, and barring anything else (death, the earth collapsing in, etc.) if a person jumped, would the fall one way then the other as gravity reversed polarity?
hi adam! great fan here. how good was the response on the tested.com build videos? i find them awesome, hope to see more of them. also: how frequently are you on imgur? ty a lot and keep making!
just want you to know adam that you were a big inspiration towards my career. can you guess it? i'm a 20 year old special effects technician in toronto canada, love it so much.
would you rather fight 1 jamie sized duck or 100 duck sized jamie's?
adam! of your whole collection of movie props, which was the hardest to get?
hi adam! it's my birthday so this ama couldn't have come at a better time! first and foremost, your show is a large reason why i entered science so thank you for all that you guys do! second, any plans to do an evolution-based busting on mythbusters? third, what's it like to travel around and doing fun mythbusting things in front of audience members? lastly, if you ever have a bad day at work what do you do to cheer yourself up? thanks for doing this!
hi adam! as an avid listener of still untitled, i'd like to say thank you! the three of you do a great job on the show and the conversations often send me off to look into a new topic. guess i should ask a question too; how is it that you manage to keep the enthusiasm and will to continue working on larger projects that stretch out over a longer period of time? how do you bring your self back into a project that has gone untouched for weeks/months?
hi adam, huge fan of the show. quick question what was your favourite thing to make out of duct tape?
hi adam, i must say i truly enjoy your one day build videos on tested with youtube far more than watching you and jamie awkwardly blow shit up on mythbusters, can we expect more awesome one day builds from you in the future or perhaps show us more of your cool ass collectibles?
do you ever get tired of being recognized in public? if so do you ever try wearing disguises and what would you dress up as?
how many of your 100 wishes have you made it through so far?
hi adam, what initially sparked your interest in special effects design/fabrication? was it an interest from childhood or was it a craft you fell into later on in life? p.s. should i keep my lips away from spinning things?
hi adam, i'm loving the tested.com videos where you build models with the guys and guests. it really has this relaxing bob ross-ian quality that i never realized i was missing, hope you guys keep it up. so my question is, if you could build a model with anyone alive, what model and with who?
as a result of watching your show a lot as a child, i've always considered going into special effects. would you recommend the special effects industry as a career path, or do you think everything will be cgi within the next 10 years?
hi mr. savage, thanks for the ama! * what was your most painful mythbusters misshap? * what cosplay took you the longest to make? any future cosplay outfits you imagine would take a while? * after seeing the tremendous amount of work you've put into your past costumes, can i make a request? the mech suit batman wears in the dark knight returns when he fights superman, maybe with battle damage? :d thanks for the ama once more!
where did the big milling machine (was it a bridgeport?) go, that was seen in the background of early videos of your shop on tested go? did you prefer the slightly smaller benchtop machine that you use now?
hi adam, my husband and i are huge fans. i wanted to ask how you foster creativity in your children?
i'm probably way too late, but there's a myth i heard a lot back in high school marching band. it went as follows: on a rainy day, when lightning strikes were happening, if you were *about* to be struck by lightning, you would know because you're instrument (has to be a brass instrument) would begin to turn blue. yeah, blue. they always said, "if you're instrument begins to turn blue, throw it and run." i looked it up, but couldnt find anything on it. is it testable?
hi adam, i love seeing videos of your early work and your most recent work, such as your blade runner pistol collection. can you talk about a prop you made early in your career that looking back on, you think "what was i thinking?" what would you have done different? thanks! i love your podcast.
great to see you on here! loved your interview with andy weir. andy mentioned (on reddit, no less!) that interview was shot around november of last year. since then, a trailer for the martian has come out. after seeing the trailer, do you think it can live up to our expectations? thanks !
hi adam. how does it feel having the coolest name in the history of humans?
dear adam, so, i found it you're a big miyazaki fan today. what is your opinion on his retirement? p.s. great documentary about miyazaki and ghibli is 'the kingdom of dreams and madness'. if you haven't seen it yet, i can recommend.
hi adam, can you please do a myth where a plane (360,000 lbs) lands on a pickup and doesn't destroy it, like in the short '401'?
in the episode "the inner light" captain picard spends the episode living the life of a man on a dying planet, by what name is he called?
killer cable snap. absolutely sure it was a thing until we started testing. shocked at the result but i stand behind it 100%
yes he does. seriously. tory is the nicest guy in the world (seriously) and feels terrible to this day. wasn't his call. he and the team were forced into it by someone no longer associated with the show.
well, there are a lot of "mythbusters after dark" myths that we'll never go near but are fun to think about. don't ask me for which ones. use your imagination and rule 34.
one should learn that sewing, carpentry and welding are all actually the same skill: joining planar forms under unique sets of rules. that was a sea-change for me.
i very much hope to play with the battlebots folks. there are a lot of old friends of mine in that community. i'm psyched it's back on!!
that is a great question. i think death would be the result but i doubt they'd let us drag crash test dummies through their fountain. but i know the guys that designed and built it... hmm.
it's true. that guy drives me nuts. (but i drive him nuts too!)
i'm very happy with the reboot. i love the show we're making now more than ever. btw we have new episodes starting to air on july 18 at 9pm.
that guy is always hanging around on set. we figured let's put him in! kidding, they reached out to us. of course we were into it. they were fantastic to work with. funny side note: after the press went out about the episode, the administration got shit for "wasting time" with a tv show. our entire time with obama, for filming all his parts of the ep, was 13 minutes, start to finish. including taking pictures with jamie and i and our crew.
we are! i expect to see grant and tory at comic con! i love those guys.
making that water pump from the scuba diver getting sucked into a firefighting helicopter... i didn't know at the time that i could do that...
we are not doing science on this show. science requires rigorous re-checking of results and many iterations to make sure ones results are free from bias. but we do demonstrate a scientific way of thinking: that is basing our results on the evidence before us. we also demonstrate that science is a deeply creative field, that is messy and full of wrong turns. making this show has turned me into a scientist: it's fundamentally altered my way of thinking. so i defend the show as scientific. i like to say that we don't necessarily stand behind our results (because of the confines of concision and making a tv show etc) but we stand 100% behind our methodologies. if we turn out to have screwed up a methodology we will go back and re-test it. that is the most scientific thing we do: change our minds based on better evidence.
3d printing. because it's currently in a more mature phase. but don't go by my say-so. and thanks for your opening comment. we never intended to be inspirational or educational actually. the fact that we were is incredible. best of luck out there once you have your degree! congrats!
the golden gate bridge. costs a fortune to film there. sadly.
number 1 and 2 are collectively my favorite questions in a long time. the answer is 1. i can't say and 2. yes.
i'd love to see them test the viability of growing enough potatoes in a small space with limited resources, though obviously that would take a while so we probably would not see the results for a couple seasons.
that's awesome! have you worked on any of guillermo del toro's projects?
you want the dan savage ama. this is the adam savage ama.
i personally like jamie's dry sense of humor, but you two are perfect foils for each other
can i just say that i really love the way you've kept their anonymity over the years! i've watched mythbusters since it started and still have no idea what age they are, what they look like or even their names (love the whole thing 1 and 2 though) i can only imagine how many famous peoples kids don't have the kind of privacy that (i assume) they have, so kudos for thinking about that! :)
i can see it now; mythbusters and pornhub.com are proud to present: **mythbusters after dark** i'm sure you guys could even find some jobs for buster heh. /u/katie_pornhub, any thoughts?
i took a class in this and still can't say fully that i possess this skill. aluminum is a bitch.
what's your favorite bot type? flipper, spinner etc?
i'm sure you could get him to give you the plans to build one of your own, then you can test it and we will all love to watch buster become a bird.
you can feel the moments when one of you is getting on the other's nerves and it really makes those moments special. we get a glimpse at what makes you guys tick and it can be tense and exciting all at the same time. i'm glad you are able to get along professionally though, otherwise the show would not be as popular as it is.
maaaan, this bummed me out the first time i heard it. then it bummed me out the second, and the third, and even though i know it by now, part of me doesn't want to believe
people forget that the president - alongside being head of government - is also head of state.
ok....so now i reeeeaally wanna see this episode. it would be cool if it could just 'leak' somehow....
what was he talking about that was supposed to be hack able?
those look kinda like the elements from the fifth element. is that what they are or just a cool design? neat as fuck though.
did you get a bit starstruck during the breaking bad special with vince and aaron on set?
watching it again with my wife who hasn't seen it. we watched boxcutter last night... it's so much better the second time through!
this is the best news i've ever heard. gavin free and the myth busters! this is my new favorite reality, no body reject it please.
so, i shouldn't be citing myth busters episodes in my term papers?
the best kinds of educational things are the ones that neither party knows are going to be educational.the ones that are so entertaining that you don't even realize that you're learning until it's already happened.
also with mars soil. not sure how they could test that. but i'm very skeptical of the whole 'growing potatoes in mars soil' feature of the book, even though that's central to the plot.
i will say that there are cases of people being dismembered by lines breaking on naval ships while trying to tie up to a pier. lots of video and first hand accounts from the people missing legs.
i don't remember their age because i didn't really care enough to try, but i'm pretty sure he's alluded to their age on the tested podcast. saying stuff like they'll be driving soon or other vague hints.
autoerotic asphyxiation myths. tested by nutbuster.
material size helps a lot. big plates are a lot easier to manage heat. it's definitely one of those skills where the progression isn't exactly linear. it's more "jesus this sucks" and then after a while, you set something up, and it just clicks and you step up to "that's not so bad".
yeah, it's in my plans. i own a tig, and know a teacher. i just have to find the time to get lessons.
i just realized how much the types of bots also sound like sex positions.
adam once said in an interview that, while they aren't friends, they do have respect for each other in a professional way. hope that makes you feel a bit better.
and is also a person...who if he wants 13 minutes to do something fun that reaches out to the community, so be it. his job is stressful enough...whether one agrees with the president or not, there is no denying they work hard and have a million things to think about at any given time. people are ready to jump on them for anything and everything. even a 13 minute break.
it was censored by credit card companies because it brought attention to how pathetically insecure rfid is
*bird noises* wot if yer legs didn't know they were legs *more bird noises*
he's not well spoken, but he's definitely brilliant.
wikipedia actually allows mythbusters tv episodes as a reliable source.
welp that's the most adorable thing i've read all day. and i hate carrot cake.
the cable part was faked, yes, but the ghosts were real.
i work in aviation and our welding shop can do some amazing repairs welding aluminum, they say it gets easy with practice. they also say that magnesium is always a pain to weld.
i'm pretty sure there are people out there who would watch you learn to tig weld.
flipper, spinner, thwack, wedge, lifter, pusher, reverse cowgirl. yep, definitely.
for sure. easily one of the hardest and most stressful jobs. have you seen photos of how quickly presidents get grey hair? (i know they're already old and all but it goes gray multiple times faster than normal hair)
how did they censor it? it's not slander/libel if it's true, so it's not like they can legally stop them from talking about their product. did they or their parent companies threaten to pull funding from discovery or something?
this. gavin is a highly intelligent man, his issue is the connection between his brain and his mouth.
if only term papers allowed wikipedia as a reliable source
fact: they had a hiring pool for ghost actors and all those who were accepted were killed and their ghosts were filmed. i almost made the cut :(
and right after adam gets shocked and says "you did use the real battery," you can see tory's face is just utter disgust at what he just did.
of course. discovery is tied by the balls by advertising revenue. one look at their other programming tells you they care way more about revenue than publishing anything close to educational.
after watching game of thrones and hannibal, i can no longer consider breaking bad "dark"
actually, the original question did say unlimited funds *and resources*. i'd count time is a resource as well.
dick cheney was only *vice*-president. don't give him any ideas.
so, in that case, why doesn't he just build everything.
how is the adpocalypse affecting you and the broader tech youtube community?
hi linus! how much shit do you get for your footwear choice?
so linus, what video do you hate the most on all of your channels? and why?
hey linus, any plans to bring back kickfarted? working off that, are there any other "series" that you plan on continuing (like the workshop?) i love your content across all three channels, keep it up!
hey linus, what's probably the most exciting project that you've done on the channel (ltt)?
hi linus, was it a conscious decision to remove the part at the end of scrapyard wars when the teams share the specs of their builds and the prices of everything? if so, why did you make that decision? the reactions from the teams over what parts everyone found have been one of my favorite things to see. i believe much of the community agrees that we want to see that part on season 6, even if it is included as some sort of like director's cut, specials, or whatever you want to get another video out.
linus, did the "walking in the rain" video have the effect you wanted? just curious as it's quite out of character from the rest of your content.
hi linus, can we get a updated ofice tour youtube video?
hey linus! thanks for doing the ama :) what kind of video would you like to make which you still have not had the chance to make, because you lack resources or something related to the idea?
what's the most expensive thing you have ever broken?
any recommendations for best cable management practices? zipties? velcroes? twine?
linus, you helped me build my first computer while you were at ncix so thanks for that! do you ever regret making a company with your name in it? do you ever get grief for that from coworkers or random fans?
hey linus, where do you and the team see the company and the channel in the next few years, especially with all of youtube's recent and coming policy changes?
hey linus, i'm a long time fan! i've got your noctua fans in my system and i'm a floatplane pilot. it's been mesmerising seeing you jump from height to height, going from ncix to where you are today and it's truly inspiring. my question to you is, how do you unwind and relax at the end of the day after working so hard for so long?
how often do you work with other tech youtubers like kyle jay, paul, and them? is it more a business relationship or do you all text and talk often?
is luke getting his own space for floatplane club, and how separated is he going to be from the rest of the crew?
will ltx become a regular yearly thing? (please? :d)
what upcoming product are you and the team most excited to get a review sample on?
i'm curious if the upgrade to red equipment seemed "worth it" to you? in the end you dropped big bucks on not only the (imo) extremely overpriced red cameras and their required accessories, but also a huge new storage server to hold the footage, and new editing workstations to be able to edit the footage more easily. it seems like a pretty massive upgrade when your quality was already very solid.
@edzel: do you prefer final cut or premier? @brandon: what is your favorite camera that you personally own? @luke: thoughts about e3 so far? @linus: what has been your favorite video that you've hosted?
do you prefer to film scripted videos or do you like the more "freestyle" videos like random unboxings? personally i love the crazy unscripted videos, or videos like about you almost loosing all your data. those make ltt for me!
how do you balance your personal time with your wife and kid against work time?
given unlimited budget, what would be a video that you would like to shoot? most interested in answers from linus and brandon.
hi linus, how much of your time actually goes into making content nowadays, compared to how much of it is needed for managing the business?
good afternoon to all at lmg, i was wondering how hard it was for you guys to develop into what you've become? how did you build the reputation you have across youtube and the computing world as an important group, and how do you deal with things like hiring new people? i imagine that a large number of people want to get in for fame and recognition, how do you deal with that vetting process?
hey luke, are you still trying to switch to linux? i'm still using windows for gaming on my main pc, but switched to ubuntu (and now to arch) on my laptop. it's a great experience, especially for programming
hi linus, would you ever take your ear piercings out/get any more?
is there something that you have always wanted to do on youtube (maybe as a fun challenge) but didn't really fit on any of your channels so you decided against it?
this question is for luke specifically. do you still regret not using flowers for scrapyard wars? :3
how much will the videos be delayed because of this ama?
hey linus, what's with the nails in some of your videos?
hi linus, how do you deal with people outside of the youtube community when trying to explain what you do for a living? you've made great strides in creating your own company, was it ever difficult trying to get loans or other business backing (outside of the tech industry like when you got the warehouse) with such a unique company? also, what do you tell your kids your job is? any ideas on what awesome build to bring for your first "parent show and tell" event in a few years? ;p
hi linus. did you feel the growth in linus tech tips as it got on and on or was more of a "holy crap we're bigger than i thought" kind off a thing?
what's one piece of tech that you'd love to see come back or updated, and one piece of tech that just needs to stop?
what's happening to the old workstations now that you've upgraded to x99? are they just being thrown out, or will there be some kind of giveaway?
do you watch other youtube channels? what are some of your favorite ones?
hey luke! are you still planning to finish your engineering studies?
with the talk about luke moving into new offices for fpc, is fpc growing much faster than expected? and will the two branches of lmg remain in separate locations or is it just temporary? i don't want luke to leave, i like watching the whole crew and wan show with him in :(
hey guys! are you ever going to do another pc build in mineral oil? the last one was very captivating to watch.
any chance for a follow up video on linus' civic? perhaps rgb lighting :)
hi lmg, i have two questions. 1: what are some of the perks of working in such close proximity with the ceo of the company? 2: when new members are added does everyone get less work or the same amount ?
oh man... is there any reason not to make content "linux" related? it would be such a good thing if you could just check how linux works out of the box in all those laptops you review... and thank you for such an amazing channel!!!
how different is working at lmg for you original members nowadays with more people? do you miss the old days with only a handful working together?
what's the most gut-wrenching moment you guys have ever experienced when building a computer? commercially or personally. i'll never forget spending every last penny i had saved for months on a 2nd hand gtx 670, only to plug it in and have no response. thankfully it was the psu, but after a couple restarts my heart still sank.
linus, have you ever watched mr. robot? what is your opinion about it?
hey there linus, why do look so depressed taking that picture for the ama?
what is the future for ltt? do you guys collectively or individually have any ideas for new shows, ideas or challenges? how does floatplane tie into it? thanks!
do you want your kids to be tech savvy as you are or just let them be what they wanna be?? he was team red the way he chose all the red colored parts when building a pc with you lol
why does ltt base everything on "how good is this for gaming"?
what is your end game for ltt/lmg? will you start a pc web-store similar to ncix/newegg/etc..?
kyle from bitwit is using youtube premium to achieve early release videos to subscribers. why not use that format instead of re-inventing the wheel with fpc?
hi linus, i love your channel and watch it basically every day, how do you find the creativity to come up with a new video every day?
luke, ed, and brandon: is how much creative freedom do you guys get? or put another way, are the channels "the linus show with supporting characters" or is there feedback from most of you guys as to what you want to do? second question, whos idea was the $130k+ worth of red weapon gear (not including petabyte project)? was linus really that shocked when he read the pricing invoice?
any camera related videos in the pipeline? haven't seen brandon in the spotlight recently
hi linus, what is the current state of float plane club and how close do you think you are before other channels start to use your platform?
since our videos are advertiser friendly, it hasn't hit us too hard directly.. but it was part of what prompted us to build floatplane club so that we and other creators would have ways to make money in the event that our adsense revenue got ripped away.. so it's definitely costing us money, but only because we're re-investing what we're making.
i've actually exchanged emails with them already and i have a call with some folks over there sometime this week to discuss my concerns. there was a lot of concern from members of our community that our criticism of intel would negatively affect our relationship with them or our business moving forward.. but i think that's not giving intel enough credit. they are big girls and boys and can absolutely take the constructive criticism with the praise. and in response to the folks who didn't understand why our workstations are using intel after that video.. even if i don't agree with their strategy, i respect that they build world class technology and i'm not going to stop recommending their products just because we're having a bit of a spat at the moment.
firetruck unboxing video. i wouldn't even hate it so much if it didn't have more views than all of the good stuff i've ever done. if it didn't make so much money in adsense from 5 year olds just watching "the next suggested video about firetrucks" i'd pull it down. it's an embarrassment.
i personally really like kickfarted but not every kickstarter product we order is spectacularly bad enough to feature in the series, but we will probably revisit it.
it's a matter of time. we've actually reached out to the brand that makes the sandals i wear about doing an ltt edition sandal. they got back to us saying it "didn't align with their brand values" or something to that effect. i was like "what?? the only person on earth who proudly rocks your dad sandals as a keystone of his image and supporting that is not part of your brand values?? what are your brand values??"
7 gamers 1 cpu was one of the most exciting projects i've done. i'll always remember the moment it worked as one of the highlights of my career. that's really where i get off - spending a ton of time on something, not being sure that it's going to work, and then seeing the end result be awesome. scrapyard wars season 1 will also hold a special place in my heart forever. that was where we began experimenting with the idea of being a "tech top gear" rather than just a review channel and that path we took continues to shape our content (even our reviews which contain more personalities and funny stuff and more little sketches than ever) to this day.
this. i found it really jarring in the final episode of the last season where you had the team talking about finishing their benchmarks and then instantly it changes frames completley and jay is starting to review them. then after about 5mins the winner was decided and it was over. seems a real shame to have this 3hour or so build up, only to have the big reveal over in about 10mins.
for the most part, i didn't think it was interesting enough to work through that section of the footage with the time i had to do it in. it was very unstructured and, again, imo, not interesting enough. maybe that could be something i throw out there as like an fpc thing. it's also something that i'll probably have playing at ltx.
we might show some of this footage at ltx, but it was very unstructured/kinda boring
yeah dennis and i were both really pleased with it.
probably at some point and so much has changed so there is a lot to show :)
he wants to make this stupid nonsensical movie that is just actually dumb. this was an idea he had 5 years ago and he still wants to do it. super cheese fest with stupid techy nerdy junk.
i think berkel holds the record for most expensive stuff broken... he got out of his chair, which caused the air shock to spring up, knocking over a 34" lg ultrawide back when they were brand new (about $1500us iirc). i was also (somewhat) responsible for taking our sony fs700 out for a shoot in the rain (brandon let me do it, so it's partly on him). it didn't work for a few days and we had to disassemble it to the greatest degree we could to dry it out.. scary times. that was in the early days when we couldn't have afforded to replace it :p
reading positive, supportive comments like this one. i also love spending time reading stories to my kids and playing with them and playing badminton.
being up in western canada makes collaboration a little tougher.. and i'm pretty asocial by nature so i haven't generally gone out of my way to "collab" - especially because many collabs are just blatant subscriber swaps "hey sub to me and sub to him/her and get a chance to win" but i've also known a lot of the people in the tech tuber scene for years and really enjoy spending time with them. so it's nice to have an excuse to hang out and make a video. i'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though.
eventually, and completely. it will be it's own building.
depends how the first one goes. if we lose buckets of money, then no. if we lose a little bit of money, then probably. if we break even or make money, then game on!
we will be making a video about that very soon :p
i prefer 'guided' where you have an arc planned out and you have the meat of what you want to say written but it's not word for word
i prefer scripted only because i don't have the same talent for free styling that luke and linus do
i suck at it :p but seriously, i have no social life, so it's just work/family, which makes it a bit easier. i get one night a week to go out and play badminton and other than that i go home and spend time wiht the kids. i've also significantly cut back on the time i spend working on the weekends. so it's not too bad at this point.
i think i've taken over most of the day-to-day tasks with regard to production/management of the children. at one point linus told me that with me doing that stuff, writers writing stuff, he didn't really have much to do some days.
for most of us at the start, it took a lot of hours, low pay (so linus could afford to keep us going), and corner cutting. actually, it sounds like not much has changed. nevermind. for my hire so far, and the people i hire in the future, i don't really hold chasing fame against them. motivation is motivation.
i am, i've been very busy with other projects and there are a lot of windows only apps that i need so i will likely be splitting my system in half with unraid.
i don't regret making the video where we simulated ryzen 5 performance, but i regret titling it in a deceptive manner.. other than that the only video i've ever actually taken down was a detailed tour of my house. i was trying to show the reception issues with some early asus tablet and had inadvertently shown a lot of personal details that didn't belong on the internet. i'm also still not sure how i feel about some of the videos that feature my kids. they love making videos with daddy (especially my son) and they only appear once in a while so i don't think i'm going to be destroying their lives or anything, but they're also too young to really understand what it means to be on the internet, so i don't know how they'll feel about that down the line.
it's gotta be the liquid cooled room, haha. so much work and effort, riddled with issues along the way, and it didn't even end up making a significant difference.
no. i am seriously considering going to school part time for project management however.
i think we'll start doing linux content when the year of linux comes around. any minute now...
one of the reasons the community respects and trusts ltt: you are not afraid to call out companies regardless of your relationship with them.
estimated earnings for the firetruck video is 12 grand. i can see why xd
"tech top gear" i'm imagining linus and luke being dropped into the bolivian jungle and having to build pc's out of sticks and snake carcasses.
that's awesome! also, same question regarding channel super fun.
so no big reaction to how they just won against a watercooled 980ti?
not sure if you frequent reddit, but there has been huge support and want for a "tech talks with linus" sorta thing where it is just down to earth discussion
this makes me feel as if you two are breaking up :(
you need to use 2 enters instead of 1 on reddit, otherwise the formatting is messed up
so when you buy an xbox one x, will it come in a box? if so, i suppose that will be an xbox one x box... i assume that some people may then re-purpose the aforementioned box, making it an ex xbox one x box... the word 'box' no longer has any meaning to me.
you're producing children? for linus? i am so confused.
that's fair enough i suppose. it not only appears to be an amazing work environment, but you get to be "famous" too! on that note, what are the basic qualifications you look for when you do hiring? who was the least qualified to be on your team before joining?
maybe virtualizating windows through iommu would help you? i'm going for a new setup with ryzen and definitely going that way
a common misconception. that series was a ton of fun to make and generated far more views and notoriety than we could have possible hoped for. huge success.
just take an old terrible camera, paint it red (by, like, dunking it in a paint can), and destroy it for april fools with the most clickbaity title you can come up with.
why didn't you guys show the teams discussing the challenge after the winner was decided? surely you asked them about their hard drive, and they asked you about some things? would've been interesting to see.
i can already tell /r/linuxmasterrace isn't gonna like this comment at all...
that's one of the main reasons for me at least. if not the biggest reason. never sell out.
instead of james yelling *hamond* it's luke yelling *dennis*
also i would watch the shit out a top gear/ltt cross over episode. i'm imagining the top gear team tries to build a kit car while the ltt team tries to assemble spike crazy pc inside of it. this is the collab i need in my life.
it's possible paul just got a better overclock still. his card was air cooled, but goddamn that was a massive cooler.
duly noted.. it's something we're considering, but we also don't want to force ourselves to create content because it's "popular". there's a fine line between engaging with the community and pandering. just trying to stay on the former side of it.
mm, linus and i played board games on the weekend at a tea party. we don't know what that makes us. yvonne and their kids were there too and they played as well. i think i was just a babysitter.
or add in two spaces after each line like that or just two enters note the spacing.
"dennis you knob! that was my garage ceiling! *sigh*"
no. reverse it. top gear has to build a pc and ltt has to build a car. no help can be given by either side. hilarity ensues
how about "tech walks with linus"? you can talk honestly about tech issues while walking places, climbing over cars, wading through bushes etc.
berkel left lmg last friday to create videos for pinkbike. look at the last wan show, nick and linus are on at the end and explain it.
lol...total. fucking. psychos. love it, oh god the rage was palpable in that video.
imagining the face of jeremy clarkson staring at an assortment of computer parts is already making me laugh
linus bear grylls maybe linus will end up in a future bear grylls series, dangling over a ravine.
thats actually pretty awesome pinkbike is a great group and he would fit in perfectly there... super jealous actually...
sure, but that kinda feels like the death of channelsuperfun though.
you have a better chance of getting jfk to do an ama mate
1. no comment 2. no comment 3. high likelihood 4. no comment 5. i have the utmost faith in the fbi there, saved you an ama.
hahahahahaha on what planet would this happen? these ama requests are ridiculous.
lol he just turned down an offer to testify in front of congress but i'm sure that was because he'd rather answer questions on reddit.
he's legally prohibited from discussing classified material. you have a better chance of getting steve irwin to do an ama.
i don't mean to sound like a dick, but why do people even post these kind of requests?
6. so you're telling me bernie still has a chance?
youre a fuckin goof for posting this. do you understand how the world works?
whilst it may be close to impossible for an ama with comey. surely trump is a much more likely candidate? ;)
this post could take out the guardians of the front page, and this ama would still be illogical.
he'd have to be a pretty bad fbi director to testify on reddit first.
hey guys it me comey. what can i make of the answer for?
think you're being rather generous on #3, doubt he'd comment on anything ongoing like that
didn't he just reject to testify in front of the senate?
this gave me a good laugh too. although i would enjoy seeing every single answer be "i cannot comment on that in a public setting".
i'm not sure if this got to the front page from people genuinely hoping for an ama or from people who just got a good laugh out of this.
he said he'd testify on one condition: it must be public.
he turned it down because he wants to testify in public. with that said, he's not going to be able to say much regardless.
maybe op just wants to know about his hobbies and who he thinks would win in a fight between 100 duck-sized horses and one horse-sized duck
because they're high school kids with no real sense of how the real world works
as long as it was really trump for maximum insanity, not one of his staff. actually, scratch that, his staff all seem pretty nuts too
what do you, who is definitely not a russian spy posing as comey online, think of russia?
it's not a comment so much as common sense. the idea that congress won't call him in is almost impossible.
he refused to testify in private, but said he would testify in public. whether you think that's so he can say "no comment/it's classified" to all questions or because you think he wants no chance of his words being misrepresented by congress depends on how much you trust or respect comey. personally, having recently spent a lot of time looking into his past, i'm inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. the more that comes out about comey, the more he seems like an ethical guy that always tries to do what's right for the country, not for a particular party or person. he has testified in public settings before we he has to respond that he can't reply to a certain part or share details of a certain classified thing, but his testimonies still give interesting insight into other, non-classified aspects.
hi im james comey here to tell u all the secrets what u wanna know
[ama request] cthulhu y'3 mnahn'kn'a: 1. ch'yar ul'nyar shaggornyth? 2. ph'nglui mglw'nafh cthulhu r'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn? 3. shagg/shogg/shugg?
that is completely a statement for optics. outside a senate hearing where no one has clearances he would not be able to talk about anything.
not with jesus, putin, lincoln, jfk and shaq all while being painted by da vinci he didn't!
hey i'm writing a school paper on people with down syndrome who submit moronic ama requests. can you tell me, when did you first develop your knack for such a niche talent?
i don't understand this comment. did i miss something on reddit recently.
maybe we can do a double ama - trump and alex jones??
at first i thought you were doing a switcheroo and saying jfk wasn't an fbi director, but then i realized it was more topical than that.
isn't he a really well respected lawyer himself? does he really need a legal team? i would think maybe one more lawyer to help with paperwork and a paralegal to file it, but it isn't like he can't make his own decisions.
i'm sure he's plenty aware of that fact and is probably preparing for that, but it'd be incredibly unwise to actually *say* as much. as soon as you go on record saying anything outside the official line in a position like his, it can come back to bite you.
just wanna quibble, but he told us that the possibility of having influenced the outcome made him feel nauseated, but he also said that his choice was the better one between the two. the man would take feeling nauseated over "concealing." i'm not expressing judgement on him but telling you what he told us.
i cant find the necromicron on amazon. could you reccomend a good vendor from which to purchase it?
but will he get the inciteful link and combocommenter badges, like /u/the-realdonaldtrump?
really? the necronomicon looks available to me, but the kindle version isn't bound in human flesh and inked in human blood, so... well, it might still be okay, depends on what you're using it for.
no link, but he did an ama where it was all very generic answers with like 5 words each.
what was your reaction when super soakers became as successful as they did? are any of your other patents as recognizable in their respective fields? did super soakers help you jumpstart any of your other research either through funding or recognition
what's your opinion of foam dart guns? and do you have any good puns related to nuclear energy?
what's the strangest reaction you've come across when people find out you invented the super soaker?
will we ever see a toy water propulsion system better than the super soaker or is the super soaker the peak of toy water propulsion technology?
we can clearly see this product was a hit. can you tell us about one of your failures, or inventions that didn't "take off"? thanks for making childhood a blast
was it an instant success? how long did it take to become popular?
i remember the first time i saw a super soaker when my family was on vacation in florida. it was a super soaker 50 and i knew i had to have one. when we got home my mom got me one. my friend down the street got a super soaker 100 and i was never able to compete in a fire fight which made me so frustrated with my beloved ss50. i still schooled all of the plebs with inferior non ss products. that was fun. no question here. thanks for the memories! what are some of your favourite childhood toy memories?
is it true that the world of toy merchandising is super-cutthroat and full of industrial espionage?
is it true that you are working on a super super soaker contract for the department of defense?
hey man! how did you realize hasbro was undercutting your royalties? what are you doing for fun these days??
what is the secret to make a super soaker shoot really far?
what's the strangest use you've seen for a super soaker?
any wisdom to offer about life? clearly, you were a smart guy on a good path. but was there anything beyond, *oh, that would be a cool watergun*, that led you to create one of the most successful toys ever?
is there a super soaker model which reached an unexpected commercial success? likewise, is there a model which failed to meet expectations?
so, do you get free super soakers? if so, i can imagine that a weekend at grandpa's would be pretty awesome.
how does it feel to be a part of millions of people's childhoods?
do you have a giant wall / room in your house dedicated to displaying every super soaker ever made? if so, can we see this holy super soaker hall of fame of yours?
you said it was an accident, what were you working on or trying to create when you made the super soaker?
do you feel that other nuclear engineers judge you because of the super soaker? don't get me wrong, but in such a high-level industry, it feels very easy to become the "water toy" guy.
when it was being designed, did you or anyone else wonder, "hmm, are people going to convert these things into flamethrowers?"
what's your opinion on the fidget spinner? is it just a fad to be forgotten or a classic here to stay?
i understand that the jtec could be used at nuclear power plants. is it possible to apply that technology to nuclear reactors on aircraft carriers, or other nuclear powered vessels? if so, do you think there will ever be government contracts to install one of these converters on a carrier?
what is the best invention or idea you've had that for whatever reason never really materialized?
did you ever expect it to take off in popularity the way it did?
what kind of super soaker ideas were left on the cutting room floor?
do you feel that as the inventor of the super soaker it overshadows, or causes other scientists to be reluctant, of any scientific work that you undertake?
i gotta ask did the super soaker pay off ???? if so how comfortable are you?
i have many ideas, but so afraid to move forward in them because i fear they will be stolen and i well . . i don't think i can handle watching a million dollar idea be stolen from me while i cannot afford legal representation to fight it off. uh, how did you overcome that fear (if you had it that is)?
very sobering. "oh wow my life has changed". i had to sit down and think about what my life would be like going forward. i am responsible, to a large extent, for the success of the nerf dart gun line. yes
high performance dart guns were originally based on my patents. i hold them in high regard. i'm a nuclear engineer, and engineers aren't known for their humor.
there's a short half life to nuclear puns, they just aren't stable.
i went and gave a talk at a school, years ago, after the super soaker first came out. i told them that i had invented it, and they didn't believe me. i left the school with them never really accepting the idea that i had invented the water gun.
jammin' jet. it was commercialized. it was a water propelled airplane that was pumped just like a super soaker with water shooting out the back, propelling it into flight. the manufacturer changed the design of the plane to fly in a circle, but didn't adjust the wings so as it turned it would roll and dive into the ground. usually causing the plane to break after the first launch. exciting toy, exciting commercial, disappointing in the end.
i got the idea in '82, had a number of false starts, and it wasn't until '89 that i made the presentation to larami. it was on the market a year later in 1990 as the "power drencher". we changed the name in '91 to super soaker and because of the consistent sales success in both years by word of mouth, larami decided to run tv commercials. in 1992 it became the number 1 selling toy in the world.
in designing the gun i applied certain engineering principles with the idea of maximizing the distance that the gun could shoot, but at the same time designing it so that a small child would be able to pump it up to very high pressure. the design of the gun evolved over a period of years, litterally. the initial designs did not have a bottle on top. it wasn't until right before i presented the gun to larami that i put the bottle on top.
i have worked with and been funded by the department of defense in the past for my inventions. it's probably better that i not comment on the specifics of those contracts however.
i went to the toy store one day and saw a number of guns being sold under the n-strike name, and my royalty check did not reflect the number of guns i saw in the store. i took out my contract and did a close review. inventing energy converting technology and batteries that will be 2x better than lithium ion.
having high pressure and a relatively large nozzle. however, as you go to higher pressure and the water comes out faster, the stream breaks up in the air and limits how much further the water travels. there's an optimum combination of pressure and nozzle size.
i once used a super soaker to unclog a plugged up water drain at my home.
i saw a stripper on amateur night hand out super soakers to the audience as part of her act. totally nude joint, we all tried for a bullseye. funniest recollection of that night was looking over at a friend and he had water running down his face from getting so close to the stage.
i wanted to be an engineer long before i knew that "engineer" was the term that described what i wanted to do. i was tinkering as a little kid. always curious about the way things worked. since that time, what i've done has been to be persistent. so perseverance and continuing to hone your skills is the key to being successful in anything you do.
i went to the library and got a book on how to write patents. but before i submitted the patent i went to an air force patent attorney. he reviewed it as a favor, and told me it needed a lot of work. through working with him, and redrafting my patent, i learned how to file patents on my own. as a result i was able to file my first series of patents on my own. now i use a law firm to file my patents for me, but having an understanding of patents certainly helps to understand when you have a quality application.
the monster was the largest gun that larami produced. it was very badass in its look. but the seals around the nozzle had manufacturing defects that were not corrected, and it did not deliver on the promise that the appearance presented. it was a dual nozzle version of the cps 2500, and would've been great if it worked as well as the 2500.
i have in the past. we used to routinely get them when we were focused on improving them and redesigning them. but at this point in time i'm not really active in that sector.
i really appreciate the compliments people give about the water gun. it makes me want to do more to improve quality of life. i'm hopeful that my new technologies will help improve more lives. in fact, the heat pump that i was working on when i got the idea for the super soaker was being made to address an environmental problem.
yes and no. i do have a display of super soakers and i have a display of prototypes we built over the years. my collection is not complete, there are some that got away. periodically i'll go on ebay to find ones out of production, and some are stored away to protect them. the room in the background of my proof picture is the prototype "museum" we have at my laboratory.
when i made the super soaker i was trying to make a high performance water gun. the desire to make a high performance water gun occurred when i was shooting a stream of water from a nozzle i hooked to a bathroom sink while working on an air conditioner that would use water as a coolant instead of freon.
i have an invention on the galileo spacecraft which went to jupiter, and my fellow engineers at jpl were skeptical that it would successfully solve the problem we ran into. it went to jupiter in support of a very successful mission. i also invented an engine that converts heat into electricity more efficiently than perhaps any other engine and it has no moving mechanical parts. super soaker remains what i am most known for. i am confident that history will be kind to me.
that never occurred to me that people would do that with a water gun, but my philosophy is that everyone is an inventor. everyone has creative ideas, and hopefully most of them are productive.
well let's see. going very well. busy day. a number of meetings. i got to spend some time in the shop making some parts for my engine. i got an update from my team working on the solid state battery. got a hair cut. had a very good lunch. and now i'm enjoying my first time here on reddit.
i could be wrong. it'll stick around, but i suspect it'll go the way of the hula hoop.
the digital distance measuring instrument. patent no. 4143267 - it used photolithography to produce a binary encoded scale that could be read using an optical sensor and a magnifying glass. that is the base technology for dvds and cds. i received that patent in 1979. i was enjoying my day job working on space craft and was patenting for fun. knowing what i know now, it is the big fish that got away.
i sold a patent to mattel after the relationship with hasbro terminated. they created boomco rapid madness using my technology. i'm curious to see how well they'll do.
first off, you can't make money unless someone knows about it. secondly, i was willing to put my idea out there and to lose as long as i learned from the experience. i felt that subsequent ideas i had i would be able to use that experience to become successful.
i worked in the nuclear field on submarines for a couple of years. *somebody* has to have a sense of humor to decide to put handwheels in the least comfortable or usable spots
that's interesting. i had a toy as a kid that was a similar concept but it was just a plastic rocket. you pumped it up for a while and then it shot off propelled by the water pressure. did you have any hand in that?
well there went your problem. you had ljn manufacturer your toy. look up their nes games.
this is especially interesting, as someone born in 1988 and thus containing no memories pre-1992/93, i didn't realize that super soakers were brand new. i assumed they were one of those things that had been around for years. til.
working with dod on top secret super soaker project. not a question he can answer in an open setting. story checks out
thanks, now i have an excuse to buy one as an adult and the wife can't complain as thats what the inventor uses them for:-)
i used one to clean out my mailbox when i found maggots in there for some reason.
an engineer using his own invention to solve a completely unrelated problem! nice!!! i have a patent for a search engine/database management system (different type of engineer). i've used the search engine/indexing component as a poor man's method of bootstrapping a durable change log and event redrive/recovery mechanism for a completely different database years later. long story short, i cited my own patent for something completely different than its original use. it's still in use and is janky as shit!
i just got the wind knocked out of me when i saw you replied. thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions with real responses.
wow, is anyone else amazed that the creator of super soaker goes on ebay to find models he didnt get???
a swamp cooler? i always thought the biggest issue was you were pushing cold air in, but never pulling cold air out and the temperature of the cold air going in was never cold enough to make a difference. never any circulation. i grew up without true ac and swamp coolers is all we had.
holy fuck that was the supersoaker i had as a kid. thing was powerful as all hell and had an amazing range. i miss that thing
is there a reason you prefer the 2500 over the 2000?
have you thought about possibly working with one of the many lenr teams. they are able to generate extra heat but the best they can do is run an inefficient steam turbine to generate electricity. if high efficiency tecs were involved it would change the whole game. please look into this.
what is this solid state battery? and when will it be ready for release? may i buy some stock in the company releasing said battery?
i have never, in my time on this site, seen an ama op respond to so many questions: especially so thoroughly. you're sufficiently lauded, but you fucking deserve it.
welp, hula hoops *did* make a big comeback with the festival crowd when leds were added. maybe in the future fidget spinners can be revitalized by making them appealing to burners.
wait, i'm confused; if you received the patent, what did you miss? couldn't you have sued whoever marketed it, since you had ip protection in place?
all good, and thanks for the years of fun i had as a kid thanks to your inventions!
so if i asked you, the original king cool, slayer of the summer sun, beater of the heat, creator of awesome summer birthday parties and beach trips really reeeeeeally nicely, could i score a kick ass super soaker ?
"ideas are shit, execution is everything!" gary vaynerchuk
did they call it "cps" because it could get child protective services called on you?
the n-strike line was started based on my patents. and the whole thrust of my approach to nerf was to take nerf guns to much higher performance. shooting darts further. using rapid fire technology. making nerf more exciting than what it was prior.
close. *plasma* helium tanks. i call it the stupid soaker.
l j n that's why it failed, lonnie. that's why it failed.
same here, you would pump it up and then pull back on the little handle and it would shoot up. i know this toy. red translucent top and white bottom/fins.
i think james found one game they made that was good, it was spiderman for snes.
yeah and if i lift the seat too huh? nice try mom
good luck; if you want one powerful enough to do that you'll have to find it used. all the new "current-gen" super soakers are pretty small.
can't help but think of a dedicated scientist working for years to create some piece of advanced equipment only to have some buffoon come along and use it as a cheese grader
a guy named thundercool, receiving advice from a guy who embodies thundercool. that's thundercool, man.
swamp coolers are used in arid environments where the humidity is low. the evaporation of the water within the swamp cooler takes its heat of evaporation from air resulting in the air becoming cooler as the water evaporates into the air. in a swamp cooler you need a constant supply of water. in the heat pump i was working on, the water would circulate in a closed system similar to the way freon circulates in a typical ac or refrigerator. in that system the water evaporates because i create a low pressure point within the system and the heat of evaporation is extracted from the surroundings through a heat exchanger.
fuck i remember that thing. the water pressure was ridiculous. actually stung when someone shot you with it. (as a kid)
i can answer that one. the 2500 is a direct upgrade of the 2000. the 2500 has three different spray nozzles of different diameters. the smallest is similar to the 2000; the largest is genuinely like using a hose. it only lasts for a second before you've dumped the entire pressure chamber, but it will utterly and completely drench your target. small nozzle for protracted running fights, large nozzle for ambushes.
the solid state battery uses a solid electrolyte instead of liquid. so it's an all ceramic and metal battery with twice the storage capacity. we are in the process of transitioning the battery out of the laboratory. we have working cells at this point. there are improvements i'd still like to make. we have not yet set up an investment vehicle structure. stay tuned.
i think he used it as a measuring device, but cds had a different application with substantially similar tech. i think he's saying that he didn't see how it could be used like that when he filed.
cd's were released in 1982. he had the technology in 1979 but didn't use it to invent cds.
maybe if you posted under a different username ;()
i just want to say thank you for letting me rapid strike my wife with foam darts from across the room. she'd probably curse your name, but for me it's just fantastic.
i'm not a patent attorney, and i 100% agree with this comment. i took 2 ip classes in law school, and i would consider it malpractice on my part to take a patent case now. it's a really complicated field; if you think you have a real winner of an idea, call your states bar association and they should be able to point you to someone qualified. edited for clarity
what's the most common mistake people make when writing a patent?
i helped a guy working on his phd who was doing work to show that evaporative cooling is efficient depending upon the humidity and the temperature. basically he calculated that in tropical climates, it was efficient and was at the stage of building the measuring gear to prove it.
the kid who had that ruled the yard. none of us could hang with it and yes it stung
isn't the 2000 regarded as more powerful, despite the shorter duration of super soaking?
that's not how patents work. if he legitimately had that specific of a patent, he would have been able to force the industry to pay dearly for it
sadly, a lot of the stuff you mention is most likely what is going to make it get complained about by parents :(
dude, that's nothing special. we all rapid strike your wife.
"the chemicals used in this product are known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects" but it's just plastic and water!
isn't this just undergrad thermodynamics? or was he accounting for various higher-order effects?
as someone from florida who has had occasion to visit the arizona/nevada deserts, this sounds either wrong or like it relies on defining efficiency in a way where the result is meaningless.
it's even more entertaining when you fill it with hot (not scalding of course) or cold water. the surprised wtf looks your friends get when they first get hit is priceless. then when they are no longer surprised, fill it with pee and you'll never have friends again! it's the perfect toy for introverts who were forced to go outside and "it's a beautiful summer's day".
maybe it has to do with humidity? sorry, i don't know the maths or full details behind it, only that i thought it was interesting when he explained it to me. to cut and weld pipe, sling a hacksaw and a drill, i left most of my uni level maths well behind me now.
you just reminded me of a memory that i haven't thought of in years. at camp when i was a kid we had a huge water balloon fight. water guns, balloons, water slingshots, you name it. anyways, this kid, jacob, he filled a bucket with water and then he peed in it. and he just went up to some girls and dumped it on them. and then he told them it had pee in it, and then he got kicked out of camp. each move makes less sense.
i think it was a little bit later, i want to say it was red, blue, and grey with a massive rear tank and an adjustable nozzle. i had a 50 and 100 and this was the upgrade at like age 10. such great toys.
in your opinion, what is the most important discovery in the last 10 years?
i'm a big fan of your ride at epcot, though it's a bit dated. if you could go back and update it, what would you change about it?
what major scientific discovery from before living memory do you wish you had witnessed or been a part of?
would you ever entertain doing the reading rainbow and reviving bill nye, the science guy online for a new generation to learn from you?
hi bill! you have inspired many children to see the fun in learning about science for many years now. what do you feel is next for the world of edutainment?
hey bill! im a huge fan and currently an undeclared freshman in college because i cant decide between a mechanical engineering degree or something in a more general science, such as physics or biology. got any advice on what i should do?
what would be the first thing you would change about the way the world is run today if you were to spontaneously.. dare i say it.. *take over the world???*
i'm currently in my chem lab while posting this question; i am a biology major. over time it becomes increasingly harder to try to figure out what to do as a profession or to even keep this major. do you have any life changing advice?
what is your opinion of senator inhofe recent re-election and his post as chairman of the sentate environment and public works committee?
hi bill! i am a senior in mechanical engineering at a well known engineering school interested in sustainable design. how do you think the world is handling the issue of sustainability today? and are we doing enough to try to make a difference in terms of sustainable engineering practices?
who is your scientific idol, what past or present scientist do you admire the most?
if there will be a second season to cosmos, would you like to be the host if neil degrasse tyson steps down?
if someone were to make a movie about you, who would you like to see play as you?
from a scientific point of view: what kind of bear is best?
hi bill! is there an art form to taking a great selfie?
hi, bill, what kind of things can we learn from new horizons's encounter with pluto next summer?
are there any plans to bring back ~~the~~ "bill nye the science guy"? because that would be the greatest thing in the world and it would give me more hope for future generations. every kid should grow up watching that show. thanks!
what are your thoughts on pluto being renamed a planet? i am asking your scientific opinion because i am currently weeding out all the pre-2006 juvenile books at the library that say it is a planet, and it has been on my mind.
bill, how are you able to remain so calm on tv when being interviewed by people who so blatantly remain closed off to logical discussions? i find it very admirable, you'd be great working in it. thanks for inspiring millions, myself included!
as nuclear power has the lowest death toll of all available energy sources per terawatt generated, what are your thoughts on instituting more nuclear plants as a means of combatting climate change?
mr. the science guy, is it more important to learn the practice or the philosophy of science?
hey bill ! i will.be coming to see you on friday in nyc ! can't wait to read your book ! my question is what do you think of schools telling their students that evolution is not the only choice when it comes to science ?
mr. nye, have you ever thought of running for the presidency of the united states? i think you would be surprised by how much of a populist campaign you could build in 2016.
mr. nye, i grew up watching your shows and your bowties have greatly influenced my choice in neckwear. do you have a favorite bowtie?
hello. bill, my son was diagnosed with autism and i was curious if there was any autism friendly children's books showing the amazing side of astronomy and science? and if not, if you were looking into the future to publishing any books of that nature or for any young children audience? i was a huge fan of your show as a child and have been learning about what you do now and science and biology. sincerely, will.
it seems you still have a cult following, how often are you recognized in the street and how do your conversations usually go?
hi bill, you and /u/govschwarzenegger are big crusaders on climate change awareness. what's the latest scientific threat we should be alarmed about and what can we do from keeping our planet from termination?
what's your opinion of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general? do you think it can achieve widespread use, or is it just a fad? take a night off and enjoy 4 beers on me. /u/changetip private (the bot will message you with a link to collect it)
bill! what are some of your favorite inspirational quotes?
thanks for making science so much fun for me in my younger years. i'm from kentucky ken ham is a asshat. my question is, what sparked your interest in science? and what's something that never fails to amaze you?
if you were to appear on drunk history, which scientist would you most like to tell a drunken story about?
why did you leave sheldon stranded at that smoothie bar?
if given a chance to be one of the first to colonize mars, would you take it?
what did you think of that espn reporter who mistook eureka with ikea?
i would emphasize climate change distinctly. the sponsors on that ride were quite nervous about it 20 years ago.
as intriguing as that sounds, i would prefer to be part of the *next* scientific discovery, which i hope involves low-energy desalinization of water, better batteries, or the true nature of dark energy and dark matter.
i'd do reading rainbow anytime! levar burton is an acquaintance of mine. and i'm always looking for a new tv show.
my movie! my movie. it's about a historical figure who changed the world by teaching himself mathematics. i'm very excited to share his story with the world, and the deal is pending so i can't talk too much more about it. but *that's* what i want to do next, and that will be edutainment.
if you are a tinkerer, consider mechanical engineering. if you experience the joy of discovery, look into something called engineering physics. with that said, i love it all! as a freshmen, i'm sure you don't have to decide yet. take some courses and see what you think.
i don't know. i'm going to a banquet. i'll play the hand i'm dealt.
let's face it, *i* won. he's *only* isaac newton.
you and i are made of **stardust.** we are the stuff of exploded stars. we are therefore, at least 1 way that the universe knows itself. that, to me, is astonishing.
we would have a carbon fee. we would charge everybody who produces carbon dioxide a fee, and that fee would go into a central fund, and be redistributed. this is how it's done, in of all places, alaska. the model for this exists in a very conservative state. so it is very reasonable that we could expand this model to the country and then the world. the average citizen of the us would receive, would get back, about $3,500. oil companies have already *built this fee in*- they are planning for it, they know it's coming sooner or later, it's in all their financial plans. if we could see this moment, we could change the world. the big idea i want everybody in the us to keep in mind, especially our politicians who got elected yesterday, is that the world isn't gonna be able to do anything about climate change until the united states *leads* us. if the united states were leading the world in addressing climate change, it would be addressed in a heartbeat. **let's get going.**
i would prefer that he had stuck to his original plan, which was to retire. although he doesn't mean to, he's leaving the world worse than he found it.
first of all, we are clearly not doing enough. i want you to invent the better electricity storage device, the better battery, and i want you to invent a more efficient way to desalinate water. if you can do either or both of those things, you could utterly change the world.
let's go!!! the trouble is, there's a lot of space in space. as a start, please check out the lightsail project on planetary.org. working together, we can change the world.
1) three of us - jay mckenna, erren gottlieb, and me. 2) i don't believe i was denied for not having a phd. that's a joke i enjoy. i think after christa mcauliffe got killed, nasa was reluctant to experiment with another science educator in space. 3) a key idea is that because life is so short, we have to enjoy *every* moment. and i'm in new york right now and loving it. i was in california yesterday, i loved that too! i look forward to snorkeling again, somewhere, sometime soon.
i'll cross that bridge when i come to it. why would neil step down? neil's a dear friend of mine, so we'd have to take a meeting.
i felt deep concern for the future of kentucky science students. that's what was going through my mind.
yes! * seek the best source of light available to you. * hold it slightly above your eyeline so your eyelids don't look closed. * if you own an iphone, the volume buttons take the picture: you can do it with one hand.
no plans to bring back the science guy as such. i'm always locking for another television opportunity to do a new and somewhat different show. near as i can tell, kids in school today still grow up watching the bill nye the science guy show. which is very gratifying.
as you may know, i would like pluto to be - instead of the last among the traditional planets - the *first* among a new class of objects we would call "the plutoids." that people get so bent out of shape about this is fascinating. and i would not bother weeding out books in the library. instead, educate library users that when the book is old, the information in it is old. it's not a good or bad thing, it's just the way of the universe.
thank you for your kind words. staying calm is my business. and it seems to me i'm working in it right now. coincidence?
nuclear power has the lowest death toll, probably because there are only 432 commercial nuclear power plants. we have almost killed a heckuva lot of people 3 times. i am open-minded. but no one would get in a car that had a 3 in 400 chance of killing you.
the process of science is a vital idea for all of us. if i understand your question, the philosophy of science is inherent in the process. this is to say, you think critically, you draw a conclusion based on evidence, but we all *pursue* discovery based on our observations. that's where science *starts.*
haha. i've thought about it. i've also thought about jumping head-first into a pile of ice cubes from the golden gate bridge.
although there may be a few, i don't know of any books as specific as the ones you seek. i recommend you get a home planetarium. and just turn that on. and see if it turns him on to science.
climate change is the most important issue facing humankind today. a clear but troubling feature of nature is that the earth will be here no matter what you or i do. we want to preserve the earth's ecosystems for *us,* for us humans.
if it's not bitcoin, it'll be something. the future of commerce is going to be all electronic. the gold standard was a fine idea, but electronic changes of funds and credits will be the future. speaking for myself, i want bitcoin in my analog watch, somehow, someday soon. but i want an *analog* watch. not everybody wants that. it's not for everybody!
i have inflated balloons with vinegar and baking soda countless times. each gaseous molecule brings me joy. that would be my recommendation.
neil is one of my best friends in the world. i always have a good time with lawrence krauss. and brian greene is pretty impressive. *talk about it.* talk about science with everyone you meet. especially talk about climate change. it needs to become a part of our everyday conversation (the way it is everywhere else in the world). i'm working on bow tie deals. i'm working on a bow tie deal right now, thanks!
sir, or madam: we clearly disagree. i stand by my assertions that although you can know what happens to any individual species that you modify, you *cannot* be certain what will happen to the ecosystem. also, we have a strange situation where we have malnourished fat people. it's not that we need more food. it's that we need to manage our food system better. so when corporations seek government funding for genetic modification of food sources, i stroke my chin.
i am charmed by both hummingbirds (with their vertical takeoff and landing capabilities) and by albatrosses (with their extraordinary ability to exploit the boundary layer above the sea surface, and travel more than a hundred nautical miles a day).
speaking of 20 years ago... 20 years ago my mom saw you in a bar. she's a first grade teacher so she was super excited to see you. you were still dressed in your science guy costume (or do you wear that casually all the time?) and you were super nice to her. she still tells her students this story. i just wanted to say you're awesome and because of that little meeting i often was gifted with bill nye movies for chanukah :)
i've recently taken up interest in more distributed and energy efficient means of water desalinization. would be cool to work on solar powered device that is portable to achieve this.
bill nye/alton brown/levar burton mashup. call it good science eats rainbow.
hey objober! im a huge fan and currently an undeclared freshman in college because i cant decide between becoming a shirt or something in more general clothing, such as pants or socks. got any advice on what i should do?
fortunately i do have a while to decide, thanks for the advice!
this is the most badass response to that question i have ever experienced.
hate to break it to you but neil degrasse tyson undeniably won that battle.
bill nye has spoken. do not denye him and fulfill his request herp_that_derp.
freeze sperm an eggs, create ai educators/caretakers/builders, send them in a big space shit far away. locate habital planet, land build infrastructure and finally grow yourself some humans, train them and build your new world. simple right?
let's think big picture here... neil degrasse tyson and bill nye co-host cosmos
reforming kentucky science student here: 25 and still learning things from my 14 year old nephew.
as a child of the '70s, losing both pluto *and* brontosaurus was difficult for me to take.
note to self: write in "bill nye in free-fall into ice cubes" on next presidential ballot.
i tell this to people all the time when they mention we are destroying the earth... no we are not, we are merely affecting our ability to live on it.
kind of reminds me of that movie with justin timberlake where you paid for things in time but when you run out of time you die. this would be kinda like that but with less risk of death.
can i just point out that it is so rare that bill nye just answered a critical question of the nature that is so, so often avoided in amas? props to you, mr. nye, for actually taking it on in a respectful and awesome manner.
that would explain why it seems equal in all directions. maybe we're just that repulsive.
are you 20 years old now? is that your origin story?
never seen the show? he scuba dives in hawaii in half of the episodes.
if you are a casual, consider crew tees or polos. if you experience the joy of warmth, look into something called wool. with that said, i love it all! as a freshmen, i'm sure you don't have to decide yet. visit the dressing rooms and see what you think.
biology is gross. source: i work in plant sciences.
if the moon was made of barbecue spare ribs, would you eat it??
and every time one of them stops talking, the other picks up immediately.
it blows my mind when i read something like this. at least now you can go nuts with what reality has to offer. so much to discover when the world is not 6000 years old.
that's the correct link, but i wouldn't use the word "debate" for what occurred on that night.
luckily this guy, other than the tax breaks his theme park is getting, has no effect on educational policy in kentucky. just last year my state approved science curriculum that emphasizes evolution and doesn't mention intelligent design or creationism. we will be fine even with this guy as a resident. i do feel bad that he is in your neck of the woods. he doesn't even bother a mention in louisville other than in a mocking tone.
actually if you were anywhere else in the universe it would appear as if it equally expanding from that point as well. so in a sense anywhere can be the center of the universe.
he's 19, actually. babies don't just suddenly appear.
scuba stands for self contained underwater breathing apparatus. the tanks are usually filled to 3000 psi.... or over 200 atmospheres (stock cartoon footage of eyes bugging out of head)
biology is gross source: got out of my microbio class 2 hours ago and still reek of e.coli
if you were hungry and made out of hot dogs would you eat yourself?
it says thousands..... not millions when dinosaurs existed.....
i don't think yoda could have said that any better himself.
i don't think a brain can withstand that much science.
yeah, i was raised in baptist christian environments, and when i started to branch out in high school it felt like i was being intentionally manipulated. i missed out on a lot, compared to students around me. the scientific method of deduction lead me to understanding things a lot better, as well as spending a lot of nights contemplating my mortality and my faith. in the end, i'm a better person, i believe. i'm more invested in doing something to advance and support humans as a species rather than just hiding out in the kentucky woods and avoiding life in the hopes that jesus would forgive me for masturbating.
yeah it's more of an actual argument vs my book is true because it says so.
oh yeah, it's terrible here, since the museum's attendance has gone down, the only people who go are the ones closest to it, so anyone who goes lives around where i am. it sucks and there are billboards everywhere and these stupid commercials, it sucks as an atheist to live so close to it.
it seems to make sense though, we are observing unexplainable accelerating expansion. something that could possibly explain that would be that we are shrinking. it would explain why the rate of expansion seems to be increasing, as if we were shrinking, the rate would continue to increase as we became smaller/more dense. it may be possible that we learn that the universe is perhaps already collapsing back in on itself, and since the furthest reaches of our observation are so many light years away, we unable to witness this shrinking in what we observe. since it is so far into the past. therefor it appears to us as expansion.
but 9 months still falls within a 12 month year.... depending on the timing, today could in fact be 20 years from the date of conception.
thought you were /u/encyclopedia_kenham for a moment. that'd be fitting.
unless you're bathing yourself in e. coli, you won't smell like it. you probably just smell like the disinfectants and the media.
but they were around thousands of years ago. just a lot more thousands than millions.
wow. that sounds like how radical muslims teach their children.
relatively speaking...i think it's the same thing either way. maybe.
i believe we worked with this or something similar the other week when doing water fecal contamination tests. yea it smelled terrible.
it uses revolutionary physics which have been used on other vacuums for years
microbiology is literally the most fun i've ever had in a class in my entire life, i looked forward to that class every single day, i'd wake up in a good mood when i had it, but the vicks vaporub investment almost bankrupted me.
hey gordon, big fan of you and your series, but i'd like to know if we'll ever see another gordon's great escape? i really loved the insight into different cooking cultures and how you got to go along with them and learn from it.
what pisses you off more than anything in the world? doesn't have to be related to cooking.
hi gordon, i'm planning to grow a home garden for the first time this summer. if you had to pick five essentials to grow in a garden that you could incorporate into most meals, what would you recommend?
what is a good dish that a single guy (who can't cook) should make to impress a first date?
gordon what do you put in your hair my man? that shits cash
for the american version of the f-word, are you going to continue the style and format that made it so well received? i know a big problem a lot of younger americans like myself and many other redditors have is the barrage of sound effects and over-the-top music that detracts from so much of the tv we consume over here.
where is your go to place to eat in san francisco?
hi chef, just want to thank you for all the hard work you out into your shows, it's inspiring to see someone after so many years so passionate about what they do. i notice you use wusthof knives when you cook, what knife would you recommend specifically for people to use? looking and buying one and who better to get advice from then you. (i'm sure this will be covered in your live class but would like to get it sooner).
gordan what is your go to vegan dish to impress? i will attempt to create your suggestion whilst watching kitchen nightmares reruns. could you also please tell me what your favourite meme is whether it involves you or not. also i'm laying in bed eating salsa from a jar and i know you wouldn't approve.
hi gordon! what kind of cheese and toppings do you like on a philly cheesesteak?
chef, do you predict any technology based disruptions to the dinning world? thanks!
hi gordon what's your favourite meal to cook for guests and why?
hey gordon, i have a question about this online class: will you scream at us online like you do in real life? if not, sadly i will not be taking it, as i want an authentic experience. thanks for the ama!
if you have to choose one for the rest of your life: cast iron or non-stick pans?
hi gordon! most of my questions will be awnsered already looking at the questions sent in already, but what i've been wondering. where did jean-philliphe go? i miss him on hell's kitchen.
hi! i've watched your ultimate cookery course and learned a lot. my question is: how is your masterclass different to or better than your ultimate cookery course considering it is shorter in total time and is paid?
did they ever have to cut an insult from tv due to it being too offensive? if so, what did you say?
are you aware of the kitchen nightmares youtube channel's love for ninooooooooo?
what's your opinion on high end cannabis infused cooking as a business model?
in a society that's becoming more and more conscious of local, organic, and responsibly farmed ingredients, have you ever considered a masterchef or hells kitchen spin-off for a vegetarian/vegan audience, or is something like that not really viable at this point?
from southeast asia to india, and spending time in the jungle. i was like a pig in shit, one of the happiest times of my cooking career. i've got maybe the next call for me, in terms of excitement, has to be south america. so i'm thinking of planning that next great escape across south america. off the beaten track. no landmark, touristy, bullshitty, stadiums, just an inside to the culture that i'm trying to learn. great escape is definitely coming back. maybe spring or summer 2018
shortcuts. just people taking shortcuts to undermine the value of doing it properly in any profession. it really pisses me off. there's nothing worse than coming across a young chef that wants to take shortcuts to get the job done quicker. if you have the job done quicker, you're removing the essence and the true passion to why you're a chef in the first place. but just in general, whether it's a plumber, an electrician, or even a police officer, taking shortcuts and getting it done quickly for the sake of it is not the smartest idea. do it properly or don't do it at all.
i promise by the last program i will find the **lamb fucking sauce**
this country's spoiled. from east coast to west coast to central to seattle to san fran. i took a bunch of mates on my 50th birthday last november, and i was up to my eyeballs in pressure. launching a new restaurant in vegas, *master chef junior* taped at the same time. but on my actual 50th birthday, i share the same day as my daughter, matilda, so it's her 15th. i took a plane out of van nuys. flew half a dozen of my friends over, my best mates. i finished work at lunchtime, flew to san francisco, had a table of ten booked at *saison*, had the most exceptional ten-course dinner finished and then flew back to la and started work the next day. and that for me has been one of the best dinners i've ever experienced. and that was my second time there. in order to confirm how good a restaurant is, first time experience is important, but to confirm how good it really is, is to go back and check it out again. and it was even better the second time round. that's quite rare.
actually, those in the masterclass are wondering the same thing! he uses j a zwilling henckels knives in the class, but wusthof otherwise i believe.
every time i'm in philly, that's the first thing that i go for. i love an extra mature cheddar on top of my philly cheese steak, i don't want the steak over sliced, sometimes they slice it so thinly that they take all the goodness out of it, i prefer a chunkier steak inside the sandwich and an extra mature cheddar.
everything is getting very it-led. we're having restaurants now that you're going in and ordering off ipads, etc, etc. so, we're missing this sort of personality of what restaurants should stand for. i'm slightly nervous about technical equipment, ya know, stoves, fires, immersion blenders using to cook, if we become over-elaborate with the science and technology of a kitchen then we're missing that human connect. i'm a firm believer in understanding textures and touching and tasting and smelling. so, i've seen a little too much of the sort of ipad scenario in restaurants. and it's just we're missing that element of fun and we can't over computerize the restaurants. recently, the idea of robot chefs, are you honestly going to fucking tell me a robot has got a palate better than gordon ramsay? fucking do me a favor. the quicker the batteries run down, the better.
for me, duh, around my house, everyone's expecting fireworks, for obvious reasons. so, what would i do if i was treating my mate in dinner tonight? some of the butternut squash currently out there is amazing. so, i'd do a roasted butternut squash risotto, finished with the most amazing sort of brown sage butter and then for my entree, i'd do a braised cabbage with a roasted loin of venison finished with a sort of red wine sauce that's been thickened with a dark, bitter chocolate. and then for dessert, i'd go for something absolutely stunning. i'd go for a classic lemon tart. something that is very citrusy. clean and delicious.
a. this is a fucking serious cooking class b. it's me! on my own in my kitchen, so there is no reason to scream because i know what the fuck i'm doing. more importantly, i'm trying to get you the viewer up to speed, so sadly, no screaming.
holy shit, having gordan yell at me was one of my fantasies... please yes..
for the rest of my life, cast iron. the longer you continue cooking in those, the more depth of flavor there is. non-stick, after a while, at least two and a half, three years, it loses that non-stick. but, listen, the caramelization that takes place in the cast iron pan, whether it's an incredible thigh of chicken or roasting scallops or even making the most amazing caramelized apple tarte tatin. cast iron pan will last generations. a non-stick pan will last twenty-four months.
i've tackled some really key fundamentals across the masterclass because we'd gone from, sort of, a to zed of cooking. more importantly, we've gone more in-depth in the way that, the ultimate cookery was not fast-tracked, but it was a very great series that was, i suppose, for beginners. the masterclass is that we just finished taping is more in-depth because i've combined the journey because i wasn't up against any pressure from the network to create 30-minute episodes. this was sort of uncut, unedited cooking. yeah, there's a lot of beautiful shots in there, but it got me opened up right to the very beginning. when i was on my ass in the middle of paris at the age of 22 without a pot to piss in. i couldn't speak a work of french and it was make-or-break and i had to make it. i had to leave that city with the best knowledge that i've ever had. that's the difference. i think masterclass is raw. i think it's brutally honest and it's uninterrupted.
i see the rapid growing demands put on restaurateurs and chefs with dietary requirements and vegan/vegetarian alternatives. pescatarian. celiac. we get those requests every day, so in this incredible up and coming *master chef junior* series, launching this thursday, we put them under intense scrutiny to come up with a hamburger challenge. and the hamburger challenge is done creatively, but with no meat. so, give me the best vegetarian burger you could ever think about. i think that it's important to show kids you can eat well as a vegetarian without protein and make that burger delicious. whether it's a mushroom burger done with incredible pesto. just stop using protein and understand that vegetarian cooking is equally as important. i've already incorporated that into this season. literally starting in the next three days.
if i remember correctly, it was supposed to be a "thin crust" pizza, and it was greasy as fuck.
fuck yes u/wcvechten that was a great question, i'm so hyped for more great escape
you're absolutely right. i enjoy working on cars and i despise short cuts. if you're gonna do something, do it right. in this hobby, you're saving yourself headaches and a broken car.
you must hate engineers finding faster and cheaper ways of doing things is literally my job description.
so biggest takeaway: grow things you can put in soup
huh, parsnips. have i ever had a parsnip? i don't know. i think my only relationship with parsnips has been growing them in stardew valley. resolved: i'm going to try a roasted parsnip. thanks, chef.
you're probably the manliest man to ever have lived.
teach us how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich
this may be one of the best responses ever in an ama...
thank you chef, a born leader and a true gentleman.
i couldn't help but notice you didn't address the question regarding whether you believe compensation for line cooks will ever improve. as someone not in the dining industry, it's staggering to me that the boh makes so little for such strenuous work. i recognize that you're a restaurateur so it's a difficult question, but we'd all appreciate your honest thoughts.
i - also - sometimes just eat cheese as a snack, and i thought that was weird! thanks gordon ramsay, absolutely adore your youtube channel. i follow along too sometimes!
lmao van nuys airport. did not expect that mention
chef ramsay, i just want you to know that kara is my sister and it truly means a lot to me that you are doing this for her. she is amazing, and this is just the greatest. thank you! also, are there any specific pot and pan sets i should keep an eye out for on the le creuset website? her birthday is coming up soon!
in honor of gordon ramsay being the coolest guy ever, and a role model to me, i'm gonna pitch in too! u/karafrakinthrace i'll gift you the "great cropping board" (or if you prefer, the masterclass subscription). messaging you for details let's get this going people!
you're my idol and you just inspired me to start running. i've always considered it such a chore and focus on every dreadful step. now i'll appreciate the free time and use it to think about other stuff, while moving my feet at the same time.
follow up: where do you go for a philly cheese steak when you're in philly?
gonna happen no matter what. once we get taste sensors, machine learning will do in a week what we can in decades.
thank you so much for the response, chef! i greatly appreciate your insight as you are true inspiration! if you have time for one more follow up question (and i apologize if it's dumb because its probably pretty obvious), how necessary is it to speak the native language? i know some french, but would not say i am fluent. when you started out in france, could you speak french or did you have to learn as you went?
cooking for my mates usually consists of throwing a digiorno in the oven.
i've never wanted to fuck a meal until i read that.
i'm just imagining the screaming as i mess things up. it's just as effective, and just as entertaining!
chef, i've made my nonsticks last 10 years. maybe i should go shopping?
here's the other thing about that nonstick pans that stop being nonstick after several years that doesn't get mentioned as often. most of that teflon that wore away over the years went in your food. you ate the teflon.
software design checking in. we are the worst for this. i honesty believe that i have gimped my career to a certain degree by insisting on building robust systems that have an eye on the horizon. everything is so disposable in this world. it gets to be something of an existential crisis at times. ...let me go take my meds.
this needs to be answered. i recently learned it's not as common as i thought.
gordon if you add anything extra to that grilled cheese then i hope you know you've committed a cardinal sin.
i agree. something ive also noticed throughout his ama's and on reddit in general, is that people from the uk (assuming not just gb) tend to be able to communicate more ...passionately? through written mediums (in general) than people from other backgrounds. ive read dozens of comments where i get a feeling the dudes from the uk, even though they dont use any typical uk slang, just from the sentence structure and grammar. i know its a very silly observation to make, but i've read through peoples comments history whenever i get this feeling and i haven't been wrong yet. from the east coast usa.
if you have a homegoods near you, check their kitchen section regularly. you'll find le creuset, all-clad and other great brands in there at really good prices. but as to selection, that's hit and miss.
i mean, i would totally give my adress to gordon ramsay but to a random redditor?
an hour ago was 11am (on the east coast). but yeah, salsa?
i'm a diehard fan of cast iron and you should definitely consider getting one. do some research on them first though! learn the proper way to clean and season them and i guarantee you'll fall in love with cast iron. then say hello to deep dish pizza and the best corn bread you've ever had (sorry, mom).
shit. i'm now fascinating by watching this guy's "tutorials".
... you eat something called "spotted dick". try putting some really amazing fried chicken with a fresh waffle someday. you'll be humming the star spangled banner before you finish.
it's delicious. and chicken is healthy, so the whole meal is healthy. i think.
i hear amy's bakery is the el bulli of the united states.
from the way his response was worded it sounds like he's dictating to someone else typing.
he didn't say he would buy the knives, he might just steal them or something.
this thread has restored part of my faith in humanity.
marshall's and tjmaxx, too. they're all owned by the same company, but stock varies from store to store, even in the same area. it's how i've bought all my le creuset, though.
i can confirm that the victorinox knives are a great value. i've had mine for years and i love them
question: what sort of care goes into fancy knives and is it difficult? trying to compare them to like buying really nice shoes and maintaining them.
also, a cast iron pan is effectively immortal. drop it? whatever. use metal utensils? it doesn't care. rust? scrub that shit off and keep using it. high heat? it's a lump of iron, it doesn't mind. you have to baby nonstick pans *so much* by comparison.
our tj max has never had much kitchen stuff. didn't know marshalls is the same people, never been there. thanks for letting me know.
if you're using the kitchen a lot, you need to have some rags available. i use two: one for clean hands, and another for less-clean things. hang them somewhere accessible like the stove door handle, etc. to clean a knife, just rinse it off as soon as you're done using it and give it one pass through the rag to dry off. then it can go right in its home (magnetic blocks are nice). takes 3 seconds. you use a steel to align the edge. do this for 5 to 10 seconds once a day or so. you sharpen perhaps once every couple weeks. there are a million ways to do this and a lot of opinions, but a simple dual-grit stone and a strop work really well. you can send it out, too, but that's a pain. buy a cheap knife at a thrift store and learn how to sharpen it. unless you want a japanese knife (rusts easier), maintenance is super easy. just don't soak it in the sink or throw it in the dishwasher. some people will say the latter is okay, but they don't know what a sharp knife is.
given what i've heard about the area, i'm inclined to give anyone from perth a break no matter what time it is
well, don't drop it. they *can* crack. but with as many ones around that are over 100 years old, i will concede that they are very, very sturdy.
as a malaysian chinese and have been learning and using english for such a long time, every time i read these uk written mediums, i still feel like i have a long way to go, how am i supposed to adapt and finally become like a fluent english speaker? it is kind of deep.
man, i'm freaking out and i'm not even gonna get any knives!!
plenty of good stainless japanese knives out there now, though my favourite to work with are still the carbon steel ones. easy to sharpen to a stupidly sharp edge and holds it a long time
what could you have heard about perth? i suppose nice beaches, clean streets, decent food and an otherwise high standard of living are not everyones cup of tea
hey amy! what has been your oddest fan encounter?
what pickup line is guaranteed to work on you every time?
hi amy, my girlfriend teaches and reddit is blocked at her school, but she wanted me to ask you: 1. what was your inspiration for "ask amy"? 2. does your love for harry potter mirror leslie's? 3. "does adam scott smell as good as i think he smells?" thanks!
hey amy! who was your favorite guest star on parks?
in season 2 you not only landed the emmy nom but absolutely killed it and got me hooked on the show. my question to you is when chris pratt actually flashed you when he mistakenly thought anne wanted him back, what was going through your head? and how hilarious was it to rewatch your own reaction? it was priceless on my end.
you've had a long day and no time to cook.. what's your go-to meal?
how do i avoid becoming depressed after parks and recration is over?
hello amy, love your work! who is **most like** and who is **least like** their character on p & r off screen? (including yourself and people no longer on the show)
first, of all i'm a massive fan, you're the funniest person on earth. your appearance(s) on comedy bang bang's freestyle rap contests are things of incredible notoriety, in a good way. how do you feel freestyle rapping has shaped your career overall? also, is working with adam scott as incredible as it sounds?
roughly how many clones of you do you think it would take to beat 1 nick offerman in a fist fight?
what is the most rewarding piece of advice you have been given during your life?
if you were to appear on comedy central's drunk history, what historical person would you talk about?
hi amy, i have to say i absolutely love you and have been waiting for this ama all day. my question to you is, is there a chance we'll get to see you on the big screen anytime soon?
what kind of kid were you going up? were you the class clown? were you ever shy?
hi amy, first of all i love you! two: i'm so fucking ready to read your book. and third: i love what you do with smart girls, i've seen all the videos and i wish i could have that kind of advice when i was about 12 years old. i thought i wanted to do a funny question or something but actually i want to know if there's a way we could reproduce what you do in smart girls but in chile and in spanish so we can spread the smarty word in our language? do you think it would be a good idea? kisses from chile!
is there a celebrity or public figure that you have a borderline obsession with like leslie has for joe biden? someone that would cause you to legitimately freak out, if you ever met them in person.
amy poehler! i may like you more than lil sebastian. thanks for doing this ama. first, congrats on the release of your book. i can't wait to read it. it better be good. i will bill you for every yawn. a few questions: - you've become a wonderful role model for women and girls across the globe. what inspired you to create smart girls at the party and then subsequently amy's smart girls? do you have plans to expand or grow this online oasis? - your character leslie knope is so refreshing. it's so kickass to see a lead female role that is super smart, funny, and driven. knope really deconstructs a lot of sexist, oppressive female stereotypes. how much involvement did you play in the creation and development of her character, and would you say she is reflective of you?
but how do you really feel about the state of indiana?
hi amy big fan of parks and rec, what is the funniest thing to happen on the set?
hey amy, how do you relax, or what is your source of energy when you're having a stressful day?
"baby mamma" is one of the all time greats in my opinion, my wife and i love it! how hard was it to keep a straight face while shooting the scenes with steve martin?
what advice would you give to a lovely girl who also happens to be a huge fan and is turning 18 today (a.k.a me)??
my writing partner/best friend and i are writing a road trip karaoke movie. what is your go to karaoke song?
what everyone is actually wondering is... when is your rap album dropping out? ;)
hey mizz poehler! very happy to have this opportunity. has your role on parks and rec changed the way you view your own local politicians now? i love the jabs that your show and character take at local government.
hi amy! you really do have a great face for wigs. what's your favorite breakfast food and why is it pancakes? thanks!
how was recording the audiobook different from writing? what was the best part of the process?
hi amy, i was a huge upright citizens brigade fan on comedy central. what was your favorite bit you did for the comedy central series? also, would you look inside the bucket of truth if you had the opportunity?
who really encouraged you to start your acting career? and what is it like knowing the impact you have as a comedian on peoples lives?
how did you like working with the brilliant ladies of broad city? what piece of actual advice do you give to young(er) women comics/actors/storytellers? also: i'm 25 and i've never done theatre or drama in my life. is it possible to pick up improv as a hobby? are there usually open classes i could take? should i be afraid of improv people?
hi amy! i'm meg. i work at girls inc. of lynn. we're a pro-girl after school program that inspires all girls to be "strong, smart, and bold." i'm in love with your "smart girls" initiative and use your website often in my programs. we actually follow each other on instagram and every time you "like" one of my pictures the entire staff and all of our girls become ecstatic! our girls have come to really admire you and all you do. with all the crazy mixed up messages being thrown around media to young girls, your entire body of work is nothing short of inspirational. so my question is... if you're ever in the boston area would you possibly be able to come out and pay a visit to our amazing young women in lynn? congratulations on your book! i pre-ordered it weeks ago and have already started it. it's fabulous! thanks for everything!
oh, i usually have very nice, polite fans. i don't have anything too weird. and i don't want to tell you, because i don't want to give any weirdos any ideas.
hahaha! if i was a character, i would sleep with everyone, but let's be real, the dothraki are where it's at. and i would never die! i would just do some kind of weird, you know, witch thing that couldn't be killed!
1) oh!! just the idea of connecting with some people, and just answering letters and questions that come in to us. simple as that. 2) ha! well, in very exciting news, there was a moment of time where daniel radcliffe and i were in the same building. and i am a huge fan of his work, and i think he's an awesome actor. that being said, unlike leslie, i have never read the books! i have 2 young sons and i am looking forward to doing that with them soon. 3) adam scott smells like... lemons and possibility. future and peppermint. loyalty and vanilla ice cream.
oh, we had so many good ones!!! we had surprise ones that we can't believe we got, like michelle obama, joe biden and ginuwine. we had great comedy people, like louis ck... and nick kroll, jason mantzoukas... anytime a ucb person comes by, it's always great. we've had so many good guest stars come by, it's an embarrassment of riches.
it was really fun... that was early on in the show, i just remember laughing, just like i do at everything chris pratt does. he's genius.
mmm. oh! well right now i'm eating tortilla chips and salsa while i do this. and i've had a long day, and no time to cook. so life imitates art, reddit.
get some sunlight, go for a brisk walk, take your vitamin d, call a friend, make sure you change out of your pajamas at some point in the day.
ah! well, uh, let's see. i think there's a little bit of everybody in their characters, but we aren't all annoyed by jim o'hare. so when the character of jerry comes around, we all can't wait for him to get out of there, but when jim goes around, we only want him to stay. but joan calamezzo, the character, is based on moe collin's life. just kidding!!!
oh! pterodactyl. because the p is silent. and my kids - that's the punch line to one of my kids' favorite jokes.
hahaha! well, you know, look - do i think i'm the best in the game? no. but do i think i'm one of the best? absolutely. do i consider myself better than nas? totally. am i a better mc than jay-z? *we.*shall.*see.* at the end of the day, i'm just... trying to keep it real. from the heart, and spit like a master. yes, adam scott is a great actor, he's a great kisser, has a great head of hair, and if this is adam scott - **i'm onto you, stop fishing for compliments!**
i love playing leslie knope, but she says so many words, and she does talk so much, that sometimes i think my mouth is gonna break. but she does do a lot of talking. i would love for somebody on the internet to figure out how many words leslie knope has actually said. someone on the internet can do that, right?
first of all, this person assumes that i would fight nick offerman in a physical way. they are wrong. i would destroy him *mentally.* i would get into that complex, wood-covered mind of his, and rip him to *shreds.* and if this is nick offerman - **nice try, buddy!** i'm coming for you!
well, growing up, i loved "all in the family" and i loved "cheers." i also loved "the wire" and "law & order." there are so many good current television shows happening too! i love "broad city"! and i could watch "judge judy" every day, all day and all night, don't stop won't stop.
oooh! that's a good one. um... maybe...whew... who would i? you know, i think, one time i had to play some, some foolish writer cast me as penelope cruz, even though she and i have very little in common. i would like to say i wouldn't mind staying as penelope cruz and i think america would agree.
oh thank you! to your wife, and you. i still perform at ucb in new york & la whenever i can, and just this weekend, we are celebrating opening our new space in los angeles, so i see those guys all the time and it was fun to write about our experiences in the book.
um: hmm. well, that's a good one. maybe " pay attention to what people do, not what they say."
i wasn't the class clown. i was a student who liked school and did a lot of activities, and i kind of floated around. i wasn't very shy, but i didn't really think i would be a performer, and didn't know anyone who was an actor or writer. i was a very kind of typical kid who liked to work hard and have a good time. but i don't think you would've necessarily pointed to me and said "darn right."
awww! thank you chile! i love you! and so does horatio sanz, who's from chile! that's a great question, and yes, as we move forward with new content at smart girls, we are excited about opening up in an international way and providing content for all over the world. i love that you care enough to ask that, and i hope to be providing more content for you very soon. rapido!
oh, that's too hard to choose. there are so many. there's ones that i loved growing up, like "unfrozen caveman lawyer" with phil hartman, and the "sweeney sisters," and then there were ones that i got to do, and then there are ones i see right now... so i'm gonna say, i loved "debbie downer" the first one, just because it was so hilarious, and then as far as a recent one that i loved, i'm gonna say... i just loved last week when kate mckinnon danced with jim carrey. the sketches are always - just when you think you've seen your favorite one, then another one comes along.
um... i kind of - i met tilda swinton a few years ago, and i grabbed her a little too tightly. there's lots of people who i am very excited to meet, and they are often not famous. but as far as - yeah. let's say tilda swinton was an exciting one, i'm a big fan of hers. and i still get excited by meeting a lot of people.
1) yes! first of all, rest in peace, lil sebastian, he will always be in our hearts and minds. and smart girls is growing by the minute, we are getting ready to launch new programming in the next few months under the legendary umbrella! and i started smart girls just with the small idea of creating a show, a fun show that started with a dance party and celebrated young people being themselves, and it's grown into a bigger idea, and hopefully, kind of, you know, in its own way, a tiny movement. i was able to collaborate with the creator mike a lot, and we really worked together in many ways to make leslie who she was, and because there's such good writing on the show that she becomes such a great character. and she's like me, but she works... we're like each other, i should say, but i think i'm - i don't think i'm as, i think i've become a little bit more cynical than her. i think she reminds me to keep an open mind and to go big or go home.
oh! well, i don't know if i can pick just one, but "the jerk." let's see... "the jerk."
i love it! i used to live in chicago, and did touring through indiana when i was in second city, and it's a beautiful state filled with fine people who work hard and love their children!
i enjoy cocktail sauce. and i get angry when restaurants serve oysters without it. and all you chefs out there reading this reddit, because i know you're in the kitchen prepping somebody's meal and also reading this reddit - don't try and pull any bullshit with me and say you can't make cocktails sauce, **cuz i'm onto you!**
haha! um... i relax by running marathons. and i get my energy by base jumping.
not, i repeat not, amy pohler, but i have heard that pawnee is based off of muncie.
my girlfriend, from carmel, claims eagleton is based on carmel. and being from rural kentucky, i am horrified such a place exists.
oh, it's really really hard, because he's a genius and i grew up listening to his records, and it was really fun to get to work with him. and he's wearing a ridiculous ponytail. i'm always onboard for it.
oh! happy 18th birthday! exercise your right to vote! whatever you feel drunk, stop, because 18 year olds have a hard time figuring out how much they can drink. be with a good friend who can make sure you get home safe, and try one new thing on your birthday every year.
okay, who cares about waffles? what a beautiful post. thank you for sharing that with me. that was **really nice.** and you sound like the kind of person that will find a lot of love and happiness in your life. because you're not afraid to be vulnerable, and you've gotten stronger in tough times. i love the image of you huddled in the bathroom. we've all been there. i can't wait to see - i wish i could see what happens in the next 10 years. i can tell you're a special person with lots of good things ahead. also: blueberry.
um...my go-to karaoke song is "we didn't start the fire" by billy joel. sung in spanish. and in a very high key.
thank you, saficus! i can tell from this question that you have a great face too. my favorite breakfast food... oooh, you know what, i don't want to hate on pancakes. all breakfast food welcome!
the dearth of ucb related questions in this thread is disheartening.
thanks for making me feel bad about still being in my pajamas at 3 p.m. on a wednesday.
are you also a hoarder like leslie? i found that really unexpected
implying jay z is better than nas is fightin' words
i'm sure they can! i know there's a stat out there for how many words/minute they say on gilmore girls.
just shave off his mustache while he's sleeping. without the stache, he is powerless.
are there pictures of that? :) you're the best, thanks for coming to talk with us.
can you explain where the name asssscat comes from?
debbie downer is amazing... especially when nobody can hold it together
"i was born a poor black child" is the "call me ishmael" of comedy movies
have you ever base jumped and then immediately ran a marathon?
i'm a non-american working in muncie as i type this and... yeah. wow.
the giant indian and the big john statue in the opening credits are in montpelier, indiana, which is close to muncie. they do state that it is in southern indiana a couple of times. the thing that always bothers me is that the cars have an indiana license plate on the front and back (we only have rear license plates here). (not so) fun fact: montpelier has black squirrels.
yes, we're all hardworking, employed, and reasonably mannered penglings.
what is dead **can never die** but rises again, harder and stronger.
i like how they put a black circle over the blur.
amy's reaction was priceless. she looked genuinely shocked and disgusted to see chris pratt's penis. no acting needed.
she didn't say you can't be in them now. just...try not to be later.
just go download all the subtitles and count each word
wow that's wild! i've never heard about her. now do it again. **except drunker**.
sounds like most of my early 30's friends from college.
one of my favorite sayings: "be the leslie knope of whatever you do"
on the flip side, have you ran a marathon that led to a cliff that you base jumped off of?
i'm a ball state student. so living in muncie, i see the similarities too.
with **bold** and everything, that was beautiful.
may* never die. get it right or the ironborn may come reaving...
yeah but now everybody is trying to sneak a peak at skinny pratts penis.
she was definitely shocked, but i wouldn't say she was disgusted. if you look closely she was holding back a smile, she probably thought it was hilarious more than anything else.
dammit victoria!! you have two jobs here at reddit: 1) assist and type the replies for our ama guests. 2) drug said guests and chain them up in the basement with nothing but bread, water, a wi-fi connection, and a burlap sack to sleep in. now you're very good at number 1, but we need to see some progress with your number 2 in the coming year.
"back then they didn't want me, now i'm hot they all on me." lol.
no, i know most of us have heard the rumors. he apparently has a hideous penis.
i met brendan a few weeks ago at my local grocery store, he lives in the next town over from me. he's a really nice guy, but pretty quiet and a little bit awkward. it would appear as though he likes to keep to himself for the most part. i asked him what he's been up to recently and he talked about his kids and his horse. i also asked him if he ever goes on reddit and has heard of /r/savebrendan. he said that he tends to avoid social media and reddit so he hadn't heard of it, but he also added that he doesn't need to be saved. overall he seems like a really great guy who just wants to be left alone by the media. it would be great if he did an ama, but the tone of the post is kind of condescending and i wouldn't blame him for not wanting to do one.
maybe not say 'how are you doing mentally'. just a 'how are you doing' is better and less condescending.
all for it but i'm a bit on edge about mentioning the divorce. it's very likely a sore spot for him ya know.
jesus, fuck this post. i know the dude is largely a meme at this point but if you actually care about him, why would you immediately jump to asking about the most negative thing possible in an ama? if the dude is having issues why would he discuss it with a reddit fanbase that treats it like a joke? you really think he's going to fucking want to be assaulted with reminders of this shit? no way he's going to respond to this. i hope he comments here just to give you a nice "fuck you" and leaves. how bout we concentrate on hyping our boi back into action instead?
why is reddit obsessed with him? i'm genuinely curious.
my brother served brendan fraser late one night at a bar in baton rouge. he said that brendan stayed for hours that night telling stories to a small group of people including my brother. he seems like a really cool guy!
how do feel about the mummy being redone even though you nailed it?
he's the best. i was obsessed with school ties as a kid. after that i became a really big fan. i hope he gets more leading roles, as he is a true talent. brendan, if you ever read this thread, i'm rooting for you!
his partner was (maybe still is) on reddit and would defend him every time someone would post hate in a thread about him. apparently he hates social media, so he might not be up for this.
if i live to see cr1tikal do a live interview with brendan fraser, holy moly that would just butter my toast.
can i see the unedited questions? i want to judge you and feel like i'm better than you
this meme is kinda funny and all but i always get a distinct mra vibe from the people who are actually serious or only half joking about it
so some of you actually clicked on those "why no one cast brendan fraiser anymore" ads.. what did they say?
i didn't know he had movies coming out soon. that's exciting to hear. i was just thinking about him the other day. i was remembering the movie school ties and another smaller one that he did about a gay jewish kid called something to goldman's or something like that. it's interesting how you can so genuinely care about the mental health of somebody you've never met. i agree with you though, i would like to know that he's doing well.
fucking ex-wife. last movie i saw had him and it was pretty good (like his others). school ties was the name and had a pretty stacked cast with matt damon and ben affleck. their roles were quite small compared to his.
did you find your high school a help or hindrance to your career? brendan fraser attended upper canada college in toronto, founded in 1829, or 38 years before canada became a distinct country. it is founded on the british boys' school concept, with masters and forms instead of teachers and classes. it is considered one of the top high schools in the country, and many of the rich and famous send their children there. as it is boys only, i'm curious if he felt that had any effect on his career.
oh wow, he really said he didn't need to be saved? so he must hate all this. would hate to think we're embarrassing the guy instead of sending support
i caught that vibe too. if i were the ama guest and received questions worded in this manner it wouldn't be long before the post turned into the jose canseco or woody harrelson debacles.
reddit seems to like doing this. i had a user diagnosing me with all these mental disorders because i included a link they didn't like (which wasn't for them to start). i scope out their profile and it's all talk about their mental disorder. i think some just want to drag others down so they don't feel lonely.
seriously. i highly doubt he'd be down to come over on reddit to discuss his personal life and mental health.
yeah, maybe you're right.. just thought we could be like a support group or something, you know make him feel like he matters.
who the heck is cr1tikal and why is he relevant here?
he was gigantic in most of our childhoods/adolescence, and then just fucking disappeared.
the mummy movies, which he starred in, were among my favourites as a child.
i think the fact that he played a big part in a lot of people's childhoods, combined with the fact he seems like a top bloke, means that people feel the need to help him. especially since it came to light how badly he seems to be doing.
i can do that too, watch... i'll triple his. promise.
'where do you think we are?' gets me every time.
i know i'm seriously salty about it. i like the mummy reboot but why change the actor? nothing wrong with tom cruise but brendan was right there, primed for the kill.
are you talking about chamcham? don't think he's his partner, but definitely some kind of family member.
i remember school ties! it had matt damon, ben affleck and chris o'donnell among others. i still have this weird nostalgia about that movie.
yea he said it, i don't blame him though. i would say the same thing if i were in his place, it kind of makes it sound like he can't take care of himself and he needs people to defend him. he definitely isn't a huge fan of reddit though, he said he avoids it. can't remember exactly what his words were though.
imagine thinking there was a community who wanted to save you when you think your fine. that conversation must be playing on his mind :(
who wouldnt hate all this? its fucking embarrassing
i'm pretty new to reddit, so i'm not even into subreddits yet, but i visited the one about saving brendan and my first thought was "hilarious". so yeah, it may look like he's being the butt of a joke here. it's not that he's some kind of an albino rhino on the brink of extinction, right? but let's go further and assume he is saved. what's next? building a friendly, alimony-free habitat for brendan where he could graze in peace and wait for new roles chosen for him by good folks of reddit? to me it looks like one big laugh. unless, of course, you were being ironic, in which case - ignore the comment.
there is a whole subreddit that pretty much has a giant pity party for him, and expect his impending return to the silver screen to be nothing but glorious - second coming of christ level. fun niche group to be a part of i guess if you have a fascination over the spy kids' dad, not so much a group you wanna associate with when requesting an ama
plot twist: you imagined that redditor diagnosing you, and you are in fact insane!
try sitting down and writing him a fan letter. a real paper one. mention your genuine affection for his work and your good wishes for his future success. then send it. it would probably cheer him up more than an iama that would inevitably have at least a few people making bad jokes at his expense for the karma.
right? i could totally see him as a goofy minnesota cop or something.
a guy with voice of 1000 angels who does funny commentary of things
he disappeared after a judge made him pay his ex-wife $900,000 alimony every year. he's had to take a bunch of shitty roles to keep up with it.
this. i'm hearing about all this divorce stuff for the first time. i don't follow hollywood. brendan doesn't deserve this. huge ehugs for this dude.
wow, i must have missed that. what happened to him?
yeah just like the guy who "ate" a picture of gal gadot for wonder woman getting over an 80% on rottentomatoes
its not a reboot though, its a completely separate thing with the same name.
no, it was someone on reddit. and it was very obvious they were together, she mentioned them traveling together for the bollywood film and how he mostly took the job because it was only a couple weeks of filming then he was free to travel india as a sort of payed vacation.
i guess i haven't seen as much of him as i thought. original comment edited.
introvert here. i bet i could guess. being around people is awesome. being around people that idolize you is probably terrifying. what if you say something stupid? what if you dont measure up to expectations? if i were famous, id probably never reveal it and stick with my 15 upvotes a week.
i can't find a link but i read an article once inteviewing a one hit wonder (i can't remember who!) about whether that title was offensive, and they responded that writing a hit was hard enough that i they considered writing _one_ of them a huge achievement. i love that sentiment, bf must surely feel the same way (and he's had far more than one hit!)
i know when i get depressed i hate people constantly reminding me of it. literally had a trainer tell me they were concerned cause i had 'no light' in my eyes. i wanted to smack her. still. so many comments are about how much people liked his work and want to see more of him. maybe we should be pushing that angle.
that header is fucking awful, but if you read the comments people genuinely like and miss the guy. i'm new to reddit too. look, lets be honest, he's aged drastically and clearly went through some shit. i didn't need a 4chan meme to be concerned. i saw his last three interviews and i freaked. seriously thought he was going to be another robin williams.
woody: tried to dirext everything bavk to his shitty movie he was trying to promote, and came off as an asshole, so people upvoted a story about him crashing a prom afterparty and deflowering a high schooler when he was like 26 jose: proved that he is the real life kenny powers, as we have all suspected for 30 years.
this is a really good idea. how do you go about getting actors addresses? i feel like its not something that just gets handed out left, right, and centre.
and from hurting his back which then caused him to lose most of his income and alimony remain unchanged despite his income changing.
his wife forced him to pay $900k a year in alimony, and he doesn't make what he used to, so i think you can imagine having nearly all of your income being taken away, along with having a much harder time getting jobs.
they should've waited at least a few weeks after the release. those advance reviews are often weighted favorably.
a stalker following him around could just as easily be "traveling together" with him... just saying.
15 upvotes a week! what are you a rich actor or something?
that's a great way of looking at it, and probably the right way. i know some people really like to hate on "lesser" celebrities, but there are so many of them that just went on to lead normal lives. like they forget not everyone wants to be in the spotlight. shit, i'm sure a good bit of them are still living very comfortably. ain't nothing wrong with that.
how dare you?! these are totally prescribed stuff that i got from completely legitimate sources for my very real health condition. fuck you randy, you're ruining my life!
i mean, it was a shit ama. but the majority of the questions he answered weren't even about rampart lmao
naahhh, i bet that one is already taken or something
this is the part i can't understand, why wouldn't it adjust if his income has gone down. can't he appeal this?
same thing happened to dave foley. he and his first wife divorced, shortly after that news radio money dried up and he can't afford the alimony. he can't go back to canada because they'll arrest him.
i never understood alimony and how it reflects on the lifestyle that the significant other is accustomed to. i can understand like 100,000 a year if you're rich or whatever, but a million is ludicrous.
so stupid. she told the judge that she needed that massive of an alimony to keep up with her current lifestyle of being rich since she "wouldnt" know what to do if she didn't have that much
i've never seen/heard of that happening, got any good examples?
nope. just william shatner. (shatner sometimes goes on /r/williamshatner
not if you count the ones where he answered with stuff about moverman, who directed rampart.
i **think** his wife defended how she was used to a certain standard of living (meaning she wouldn't accept less than $900,000 per year or whatever ridiculous amount of cash it was)
you would think, right? my father is in the same situation. made six figures owning a contracting company in nyc, and they did work for big companies. they were working on cantor fitzgerald's new office at the world trade center when 9/11 happened. they lost two guys there. my parents divorced soon after, and within a couple of years the company went under. he has had multiple jobs, had people including myself testify in court, and provided pay stubs since the original proceedings. he made nothing close to his old salary. even my mother knew this but she was vindictive beyond reason, at a man who spoiled her rotten. you know what nys said? nah, pay the original amount. the courts do not give a shit.
his story gets so much worse then that. the podcast with joe rogan is really good and he talks all about it. he had to live seperated from his wife for a year (required by law for a divorce here), while she spent all his money going on lavish trips and just overall spending out of control. nothing he could do except watch either. poor man, i feel for him.
i like the chris rock bit, though. just because you're *accustomed* to something doesn't mean you're entitled to it. as chris said, the man is *accustomed* to having sex with his wife. she's not going to be forced to have sex with him after a divorce, because that would be crazy right? so the idea that being accustomed to something and are therefore entitled to it doesn't really hold any water.
yeah idk what he's talking about, i've never seen a certified fresh movie go from 92% on opening weekend to below 80%
true. so was it not even him? was it a pr guy just trying to get publicity for the movie?
as a woman, this fucking sucks. i hate women who do this shit. fuck you if you're like that. i wish i was a judge. i'd be so fucking fair in shit like that. smh oh, your husband makes x amount and you don't have a job? too bad. go get a job. i'm not giving you 900,000/a year. it only costs 250k from birth to 18 to raise a child." fuck bitches that do that shit. :
yeah. i mean, i can understand if the child is in some high end school, it can make sense to continue payments to maintain that level of education or whatever, but if your husband is famous and you're not, it makes no sense why you would get to continue living in mansions after you get divorced. you're separating yourself from the breadwinner, you get no bread. it used to make sense ages ago when society had women more dependent upon men and losing your husband meant you lost your income but today it's super outdated. it might even make sense to argue that she became a housewife instead of a career woman and now it's too late to make up for lost time or whatever but to assume she could have raked in ~1m a year or to factor that in but ignore his change in income is ludicrous.
damn, is canada as fucked up as the us in that regard? i just heard some dude got fucked over in a divorce and assumed it was america lol
i know, i'm just echoing the sentiments of many fans who were behind this movement.
i would add - also as a woman - there seems an underlying bias suggesting women are helpless/incapable of supporting themselves in these kinds of decisions. i mean, i'd understand if the relationship was horribly abusive or the husband walked out suddenly. in that case, the wife is going to need some time to sort herself out. plus, i completely support the equal division of marital resources as an acknowledgement of the behind the scenes labour a wife (or stay-at-home-husband/unicorn) does which makes their so's extraordinary achievements possible. but paying $900k a year *after* the marriage for another decade or something... there should be a provision to help the partner get on their feet, but this is insane. what else can it say but "you're nothing but a trophy wife and have no hope of surviving on less than $1million a year"?
alimony doesn't even cover child support. that's a whole other mess of payments.
what are your biggest struggles while on the set of the show game of thrones?
being a belfast native, i'd just like to ask what it's like filming here?
have you had one of those "i can't stop laughing" moments on the got set? if so, what was so funny???
at what point did you realize that game of thrones was becoming a huge deal?
hi maisie, thanks for doing this ama. what's been the biggest change in your life since starting game of thrones? also, which cast member is most like their character on the show?
hi maisie! just curious, do you get to keep needle, or at least a replica of it for yourself?
hi maisie! if you were somehow elected as supreme queen of westeros, what would be the first law you would pass as ruler?
hi maisie, do you still have contact with/see/visit the wolf from book 1 of game of thrones (nymeria i think) ?
hello maisie, has there been a scene so far in game of thrones that was particularly difficult?
hi maisie! i hear you're a dancer. what is your favorite type of dance and why?
masie, when you came to indianapolis, a guy in the con asked if you could read his name in the death prayer. after a bit of a laugh and doing it you said that was the strangest request? has anything topped that yet? and could you put my screen name in one? a little bit of irony, i know.
if you could meet any famous person or historical figure dead or alive who would it be and what would you do with them?
how do you managae to work school/college around your acting? also, what is your favourite subject?
if you don't know the words to a song, do you improvise?
hi maisie regarding the last of us, have you ever played the game? do you it'd make an impact on your decision playing ellie? (personally i think you'd be spot on!)
hi maisie! do you have any favourite video games? a while back i saw you were a fan of hat films! absolutely loved cyberbully and really looking forward to seeing the falling.
i'm curious how people handle children/minors on the set of a tv series with so much adult content. is there a lot of separation between the parts you film and other parts? are you allowed to watch got?
why are you so obsessed with the lion king intro song?
have you read the books? had you heard of them before you got the role?
are you and rory mccann really good friends still? i hope we have not seen the last of the hound!
is there any actors who you would love to work with?
hey maisie. love your performance as arya, got is hands down my favourite show on the air, and the amazing cast is to thank for that! my question is, how has the experience of portraying the character development of arya been like, do you feel any similarities or differences between you and her? ...and also, do you ever look at chickens the same way anymore?
hey maisie, i'll ask what everyone on /r/thelastofus has been talking about. **will you play ellie in the last of us movie?** did you do a table read of the script? do you *want* to play ellie? thanks!
i follow you on twitter, you're super cool. what's the funniest thing your turtle has done?
hi maisie! is there anything you specifically find odd about american culture?
hey maisie, what would you name the first city on mars?
great work in cyberbully, i saw it and you really keep the attention of the viewer all through, quite a feat for such a focused one-room movie! i'm curious what is your favorite music and your favorite movies or tv shows at the moment? cheers
do you have any interest in doing theater work in the future?
do you want the hound to live? what do you want to be when you grow up?
hi maisie, big fan. in the event of a "cheeky nandos" what spice do you have on your chicken? cheers and have a nice day!
if you were a pizza, what kind of toppings would you have?
hey maisie! if you could only eat one type of cheese for the rest of your life what type would it be and why?
what's your go-to cure for a rotten, stinking cold?
hi maisie! thanks for doing this! watching you and rory mccann play my favorite duo on the show has been a dream come true for me. i would go so far as to say you guys did it even better than i pictured in the books, so thanks for being so awesome! i have a couple questions (feel free to ignore if these have been asked already)... 1) if you could trade roles with anyone (male or female) on game of thrones, who would you want to play and why? 2) who would you want to sit the iron throne? 3) if you could have any superpower, what would you pick? 4) if you could have a career other than acting, what would you pick? 5) what's your favorite colour? thanks again! you are such a fantastic performer to watch, and i really look forward to seeing what else you do in the future =d
hello, maisie! typical reddit question: what is your favourite breakfast cereal?
hey maisie! greetings from california at around 6 am. i stayed up all night to make sure i could get a couple questions in. i love how you portray arya stark, you're amazing! i love your vines as well they're pretty funny! now onto business: what would you like to move on to after game of thrones? how great is sophie turner in real life? how was it like not fainting around pedro pascal? now the obligatory reddit question: would you rather fight one hound sized duck or a 100 duck sized hounds?
i've been so afraid to make you my favorite character on got, because everyone says that whenever you pick a favorite character, they get killed off. but, on to a question, out of the stars, what is your preference, star wars or star trek? and have you seen that movie whiplash? if not, you should. it's pretty crazy.
if you could have arya kill anyone in the show, who would it be?
hey maisie! if you could time travel, when would you go to?
do you speak any other languages, and if not, which ones would you like to learn?
how did george r. r. martin get the idea of casting you as arya in got and why did you accept the role? thanks :3
ehm... i wanna go back to iceland, but in the winter. it looks *so* beautiful.
freezing cold. but the people are lovely, so that makes up for it.
the one time was in series 3, episode 8, when i was supposed to laugh anyway - when arya cracked up laughing at the news of her dead aunt - and i was watching funny videos on my phone, so i giggled endlessly, and they liked it, and so did the audience.
oh! john tucker must die. it's like, about 3 girls that fancy this one guy, and it's so cheesy, but i can't stop watching it, ever.
patronizing adults, saying "*back in my day, blahblahblah"* because i'm sure they found it annoying in their day when adults said *back in my day* - i don't know what it was like in your day, i was only born 17 years ago, so stop being patronizing about it!
season 3. at the season 3 premiere, we went to the chinese theater in los angeles, and stepping out of the car, with hundreds of people screaming my name, is when i realized that this show completely changed my life. it was very, very daunting - i found it quite scary - but it happened gradually, so i had time to get used to it.
being recognized in the street. i used to enjoy being quite anonymous, and now i have to kind of be aware that people know who i am sometimes. rory is quite similar to the hound before breakfast, in that, if he hasn't eaten, he's kind of grumpy! haha! but i love 'im regardless.
ehm... oooh, if i was the queen of westeros, the first rule... i would make everyone a wildling, because i think their costumes are really cool! it's probably the most shallow answer *ever*, but it's true.
i don't get to see the dogs anymore. but after my dog (who played nymeria) finished playing nymeria, she actually went on to play shaggy dog, and they dyed her. she was the best behaved dog out of all of them, so she ended up playing all the other wolves, even though she was mine originally. yeah. it's cool!
no, that is still definitely the weirdest fan encounter that i've had. i tell people about it all the time, it was so funny.
my favourite subject when i was at school (apart from the usual drama and english) was mathematics, and it was really hard to juggle school & work. and... i sort've... this is a tricky question - school took a bit of a back-seat, and i took my opportunities in live, and hopefully in the future, if i go down a different back, i can go back, get my grades, my certifications, and go and do something else if i want to.
all the time. i thought taylor swift's new song said "something-something-starbucks-lovers" when it actually said "i've got a long list of ex-lovers" and that was news to me. and i realized i'd been embarrassing myself for like 2 months!
me and my brothers enjoy playing a computer game called "amnesia" which is *really* scary! we haven't completed it yet, but we're close.
i bet maisie has a stiffy for smiffy. i know i do.
i'm allowed to watch the show. i'm not around when they shoot the more adult scenes. but yeah, i watch the show, i enjoy it, and i feel like i'm a bit of a fan of the show.
because... it's kind of the only song that anyone can sing, no matter how good or bad their musical talent is. and it's just really catchy. and i just like doing it to animals. and they quite hate me for it, but it's funny. like, i did it with a ladybird in a vine. and immediately afterwards, it flew away. which was very sad.
i haven't read the books. and i didn't read them before i got the role. i do want to read them but i'm going to wait until the season is finished. but i can't wait to see what really happens to arya! yes!
hey aidan! he's just gone outside. aidan - everyone says thank you! he's gone, but we'll come back to it in a minute so we can write his answer.
pie! i like savory pies, like meat pies. i don't really like sweet food.
my favourite movie - the amazing spider-man. and my serious favorite film is called like crazy.
i used to enjoy high-jump, although i'm really short, i did beat a lot of kids that were a lot taller than me. i have a very springy jump, i think. i enjoyed high-jump.
secretly enjoy? oh! well it's not much of a secret, but i really enjoy the great british bake-off. it's like a competition show, but they all bake it, and it's very funny, because they all cry over techniques. like if they get their cake wrong, they're just sobbing over a spongecake, and i find it hilarious.
dogs. we used to have 13 dogs. that's quite a lot of dogs. and i'm never had a cat. dogs are awesome.
i've answered this question before! my sigil would be a tortoise, and my saying would be "go hard or go home" because your shell is hard, and it's also your home, so...
my favourite music... ehm... is probably like drum & bass, and bass lines? and the tv i watch at the moment, i don't have a lot of time to watch tv. so probably as i said earlier, the great british bake-off. i religiously watch that.
game of thrones! it was my second audition. i was completely in the right place at the right time. and now it's completely changed my life, and now i find myself doing a reddit ama, which is kind of crazy.
i go with lemon & herb, but i get the medium sauce. and occasionally, if i'm feeling daring, i go with the wing roulette, and burn the mouth!
it would be... halloumi cheese, because i think it's probably the best thing that has to be invented. but it has to be grilled. it's like rubbery, and squeaky, like cheesy bacon. you should try it. it's really salty. amazing.
perfect sandwich... cold chicken, salt & vinegar crisps, and tomato ketchup. i actually had it last night, that was my dinner.
1.) i would love to play... cersei, because she's badass. 2.) ehm - i think... bronn (tyrion's left hand man) would do a really good job? cuz he's funny! 3.) ehm...oooh! if i had a super-power... i can't think of anything? oh! probably shape-shift. 4.) dancing. that was kind of my career path before acting, but yeah. things change. and now i'm acting. 5.) green!
muesli. but only the special kind from waitrose. it's like the green stuff. it has to be that one, otherwise i won't eat it. very specific.
first of all, thank you for staying up so long, that's really really nice of you! and after game of thrones, i'd love to continue in television, and i'd love to move on to movies as well. i don't really know what i want to do? but i think that's quite cool, because i'm only 17 and i don't have to decide yet. but definitely staying in performing. she's absolutely fantastic. she's probably one of the funniest girls i know. and i'm so glad that i met her. it's very difficult. i'm madly in love with him. and it's quite - everybody has a crush on him. but i'd never tell him. oh well, now the internet knows. hahahaha! oh! i would love to fight 100 little duck-sized hounds. because i'd never in my life looked down on rory, and that would be an interesting situation.
i can really badly speak french and german. i would love to learn french & german more, but i'm just really bad at learning languages. like, *why do words have genders?* it confuses me. a lot. like it's just -- what?! a table? i don't get it. anyway...
i interpreted that scene as arya laughing at the miserable hound, foiled once more. and that's why her open and heartfilled laugh made a big impression on me.
this is by far the most damning piece of evidence that you're a teenage british girl and that victoria can perfectly voice a person through text.
how many times a day on average does someone recognize you on the street? do you embrace the kinds of attention in every day life, or does it eventually become to wear you down somewhat?
tommen would outlaw beets, so you're doing a bit better than him so far.
she doesn't say "starbucks lovers"? are you shitting me?!
judging by the rate at which martin's working, you'll probably get to act out what happens to arya before we get to read it.
(*remembers when tobey maguire was spiderman*) (*single tear falls downs cheek*)
you should totally check out game of thrones. i'll let you borrow my hbo go password if you'd like.
oh god. i was born in cyprus and apparently as a toodler i didn't each much else. halloumi is love. the squeaky cheese. the cheese that grills. bouncy happiness! my mum still barbecues it sometimes.
quite amused by victoria's struggles to figure out what exactly the alien british things maisie's referring to are. i can completely relate. it's "waitrose".
it's okay, he already knows you have a crush. it is known.
the dog's just a *really* good actor. i heard might even be in the running for an oscar this year.
next on game of thrones. the mountain and the gaben.
the series will probably go through 3 reboots before that happens.
i'm sad that i can't ever play that game for the first time again. i grew very attached to the characters.
*remembers when willem dafoe was green goblin, alfred molina was doc ock, and james franco was harry osborne* *three tears* *remembers when eric forman was venom* well i feel better now
i've met people who don't take milk, and i've met people who take sugar, but i don't think i've ever heard of someone who doesn't take milk but does take sugar before. it's crazy.
'hot fuzz', best movie ever filmed. really, it's a movie that you can watch ten times and still discover something that you didn't quite get the first time.
leading a massive wolf pack through the river lands that's constantly tearing people up, and acting as a chekov's gun waiting to go off.
okay you've convinced me. buying it right now. be jealous of my first time experience.
is it common drinking tea with milk? in portugal we only do drink it with sugar.
did you know peter jackson is the santa that stabs simon pegg?
grrm real good at loading those chekov's and leaving em lying around.
stay the fuck away from spoilers you're in for an amazing ride. don't look up anything online, just enjoy. the last of us is easily the best game i've ever played.
i'd say about 95% of people drink their tea with milk over here. but i just made that statistic up based on personal experience.
...um...... what is it? can ya fill the rest of us in?
and that cate blanchett is the (masked) girlfriend of simon pegg's character?
and that every death is foreshadowed subtly right before they die!
guess most of the people here are talking about black tea. because nobody would drink a fruit or pepermint tea with milk
how did you get enough funds to make your way to america? how was the trip arranged?
was your father given a mock trial prior to his execution, to give the appearance of justice having been served? i'm sorry for your loss, it's inspiring to hear someone who went through so much hardship make something of themselves.
what are your thoughts about current events involving russia, ukraine, and the us? how do you think the conflict should be resolved?
besides starting a company in america, what's one thing that you're proud to have accomplished? also, what was the scariest thing about the soviet union?
what was your first meal in america? how did it compare to the foods that you were used to eating?
what is your opinion of this year's presidential election?
what cultural difference shocked you the most? edit 1 holy shit 2k
any thoughts on the syrian refugee crisis? specifically how some americans are worried that isis members can pretend to be refugees to sneak into the us. did you experience any similar anti-communist backlash when you came to america? my parents were refugees from communist vietnam, so i'm very interested to hear another refugee's opinion.
how the hell did the us let a russian immigrant work on intercontinental ballistic missile launching systems? was there no fear of spy activity? curious as to what kind of background checks you were subjected to.
why did your father get executed by the secret police?
would you say there are any similarities between the propaganda you experienced back then and what's being shown today?
was there ever a time where you agreed with communist idealism? if so, what changed your mind?
thank you for your contributions both engineering and otherwise. what was it really like to live under a brutal totalitarian regime? are there any details or events that might help your modern american understand? how do you view edward snowden and the issue of warrantless surveillance by the nsa?
what do you think of how socialism is influencing the younger generation?
how do you feel about socialism and/or bernie sanders?
hi! thank you so much for sharing your story. i am so sorry you went through all of this. i specialized in soviet history during the great terror (1936-40, give or take). how did the populace react to things like the sudden fall from grace of police leaders like nikolai yezhov or genrikh yagoda? did people around you seem to sincerely believe in the righteousness of what was occurring? that it was scary, but necessary for a better future? what humor, if any, did people employ to face this sort of horror? thank you so much for any answers!
was the holodomor ever any kind of public knowledge?
i was curious about your experiences with the religious community during this time. i have heard much about persecution, especially for christians during this time. what did you see and experience?
what is your response to americans who wish to embrace communism here in the u.s.? what about americans who wish to embrace socialism?
how did you develop your "american dream"? where did you find information about the u.s. when you lived in the ussr?
hi mr. konstantin, thanks for doing this ama. and thanks miles for doing the replies. i've heard that communist countries only survive government controls because they have extensive black markets. did you yourself engage in any black market activity? did you know it was going on? did the police try to shut it down? did they let it happen because they too needed it?
do you believe stalinist ussr was a perversion of communism or do you just equate the two? where do you stand on unrestrained capitalism?
where do you stand on the continium of socialism vs. capitalism? what advice would you give to our increasingly popular socialist movement here in the united states? note: not trying to compare socialism to communism i'm simply curious about his perspective.
did you ever have to lie or at least not tell the full truth to save your own or someone else's life? if so what was it?
do you feel that the we are still in a "cold war" with russia? what do you think could be done on the part of the us and russia, to settle tension between the two countries?
do you remember shostakovich and his works around the time when he was composing them? he's my favorite composer.
considering you are so familiar with communist propaganda, what propaganda exists in the united states that you think most of us citizens are blind to?
do you see any parallels between what we call political correctness today, and the sort of dogma enforced by political commissars back in the day?
what do you think of tankies? tankies are sheltered western people who say that mao, stalin and north korea were defenders of the worker and proud enemies of us imperialism. they also say that everything was great in ussr. no famines, no gulags.
have you ever had any thoughts of moving back to russia seeing as the brutal dictatorship is gone?
i sincerely hope i'm not too late. what are your views on american gun rights and the second amendment?
do you blame the idealism of communism as a whole for the atrocities, or do you blame the autocratic dictatorship of stalin? many people like to say communism is evil because of the warped way that dictators have used it to their advantage, however when karl marx wrote his books i am quite certain the soviet union was not what he had in mind. even people like leon trotsky fled the ussr after lenin died because he knew stalin would turn the government into something sinister. so in short, what im asking is, do you blame communism or do you blame stalin?
yes, the people in those countries did a lot of singing. someone would even sing loudly to themselves depending on how they felt.
not the most appropriate username for this ama kek
i didn't need any funds. the united nations refugee organization took care of all travel arrangements for displaced persons like myself. at that time the united states admitted 200,000 displaced persons from europe.
the trials were secret and we didn't know the results until 50 years later when gorbachev came to power. the kgb made lists of suspects who were tortured into signing prepared confessions and then were sent to the gulags or to be executed, usually standing on the edge of a ditch and receiving a bullet in the back of the head.
from putin's point of view, it's inadmissible that ukraine should join nato. the united states became involved because it was a signatory together with russia and ukraine to the agreement that ukraine surrenders the nuclear weapons on its territory in exchange for guaranteeing its borders. the majority of people in crimea prefer to be part of russia rather than ukraine. therefore, the question is very complex and if one considers history and the different requirements of the parties, i do not see any reasonable solution.
my biggest accomplishment aside from starting my business would be staying married to the same woman for 61 years. the scariest part about life in the soviet union was that people like my father would disappear with no explanation.
my first meal was pretty horrible food on the ship coming here. the captain was a frenchman who spent most of the food money on dramamine for the refugees. whatever we ate was full of celery and 65 years later i still cannot stand it. in the ussr i was used to eating anything that was available. i was overwhelmed by the availability and choice of food in an american supermarket.
the project was classified as "confidential" not "secret". after i became a citizen i got confidential clearance that permitted me to work on these projects.
he was executed because he was corresponding with his parents in romania and any correspondence with a foreign country made one suspected of being a spy. 50 years after his disappearance, a letter from the kgb informed us of his execution and also that he was being "posthumously rehabilitated", admitting that he was innocent.
the soviet propaganda was hammering into us that life in the soviet union was incomparably better than it is in capitalist countries. at that time, there was the great depression in the west and they showed us news reels featuring lines of the unemployed. we were not aware of the real situation in the west. in countries like the soviet union or north korea, their leader is considered to be omniscient, omnipotent, and benign. considering the police terror, people were afraid even to think about any deficiencies because a careless word could bring disaster.
you may find answers to your question in my first book, a red boyhood. in the soviet union the citizens were terrorized by the government and could be made to disappear without any court oversight. in regards to snowden, i can't visualize a country functioning if every citizen could decide what is appropriate and what should be published based on their personal beliefs. the american judicial system is based on punishing acts that have already happened. the challenge now is to be able to prevent these acts from happening in the first place. this means that the government has to know what people are thinking. the difference is that suspects here are still entitled to their day in court.
well socialism is a very comforting idea that someone is going to take care of you. it is not compatible with the american idea of meritocracy and does not encourage initiative and effort.
bernie sanders didn't provide a good answer about how he was going to finance his plans. his ideology itself is fine in theory: he'll take care of everything and everyone. however, it would eliminate incentives for individual achievement.
for those who don't know, the holodomor was an artificially created famine in the ukraine. the kgb did not allow bringing grain from other parts of the soviet union where it was available and was even exported abroad. in the ukraine, they took all of the smart peasants and sent them to siberia or killed them because they did not want to join the collective farms. the ones who remained didn't know what to do and were placed into these disorganized and chaotic collective farms. at the same time, an american correspondent named walter duranty from the new york times received a pulitzer prize in 1932 for his reports that there was no famine in the ukraine. this caused people in the united states to be unaware of the famine. there are various estimates as to the total number of people who died and they vary from 5 to 8 million.
to those who wish to embrace communism, i would advise that they read the black book of communism published by harvard university press. to those who want to embrace socialism, they should first figure out who is going to pay for it.
i escaped to the american zone of west germany and there was plenty of information. i developed my "american dream" from reading american books which were reprinted in the soviet union only when the books were criticizing the united states. however, they still shed some light as to what was going on. for example, reading the grapes of wrath by steinbeck, i couldn't understand how people who owned a truck could be considered poor.
stalinism was not unique if you consider mao and pol pot. i do not believe in unrestrained capitalism. just reading the business section of the newspaper, one can daily see the unethical or criminal behavior of some companies and executives.
not op, but i am russian. in my opinion - both should stop fucking in other countries problems. both should stop propagandizing that it's better in their country and worse in the other. the cold war itself stopped, but we still have some icicles left to melt. both counties seem hellbent on not doing it.
there is none, the us is the greatest country in history
no, because the brutal dictatorship has been replaced by a milder dictatorship.
if you remember, were there people that were horribly off-key, or people just didnt care and were happy to be singing?
do you think the us and/or european countries should take in syrian refugees?
idk if you've seen the tv series "the americans" but there is an episode that deals with a sham trial and a summary execution. i wonder how realistic this was in 1983?
amazing answer. i am really happy to see a person with an actual knowledge of the conflict.
as sergei korolev(the guy that designed r7 rocket and sputnik and was in gulag before that) used to say "'we are all going to be whacked and there will be no obituary" it was referring to people simply disappearing without a trace in the ussr after being targeted as "enemy of the state"
that reminds me of a famous photo of yeltsin browsing the produce section of a grocery store in my hometown of houston circa 1990. apparently he insisted on an unplanned side trip to inspect an american supermarket. he looks a bit flabbergasted in the photo. this is a great ama, keep the answers coming!
coming from a family of refugees, this is why i can never be a vegetarian. i actually appreciate the opportunity to eat steak and chicken whenever i want.
do you feel any guilt about developing weapons designed for mass murder of your (former?) soviet countrymen? i mean these are people you grew up with as a child. did you ever stop to think about it?
posthumously rehabilitated. . . . . interesting phrasing sir, sorry for your loss.
what do you think motivated the kgb or current powers that be in russia to "pardon" him in this way?
thanks for the reply! personally i can't imagine living somewhere where i could be arrested for expressing an opinion so i guess that must have quite the adjustment to make.
it was in fact awful here during the great depression.
interesting. just to clarify, you're saying that a citizen that witnesses his government engaging in unconstitutional behavior should keep his mouth shut, as it's not up to him to make that judgement?
so you're saying the government should spy on its citizens?
oof, there's a lot of people on this site who are not going to like that answer.
it's almost as though atlas shrugged was based on some real country.
i can see why the soviet union would allow the publication the the grapes of wrath. its an explicitly socialist book.
this really kind of proves the question he's postulated. stalinism isn't unique because there's been no 'real' implementation of communism anywhere in history, and the permeation of the idea spread the controlling philosophy of said revolutionaries. not defending communistic causes, the responses to economic causes seem to be portrayed black and white, only to scapegoat horrible dictatorships with terrible economic policies.
on the american side of the fence, it seems that we could get along, but if we did decrease any pressure then putin or a different russian leader would annex another former soviet country which we *really* find unacceptable. any expansionist russian move at all would be unacceptable to the us and all of europe. putin says he's not interested in an expansionist or imperialistic policy "like the us". but then says 95% of the people in the next place to be annexed are interested and does it. and so it gives us the current situation. perpetual war mongering. perpetual missile defense shields. perpetual threats to cut off gas to europe (which almost never happens because russia needs the money). what do you think, i would like a different perspective.
i found that question really odd. putin is still an authoritarian.
hungarian here, its an eastern european thing, can confirm.
they sang for themselves rather than for an audience.
i grew up in russia and i sing to myself all the time. drives my girlfriend crazy. she's a musician and my singing is terribly terribly off-key.
i don't think he'll respond because that's a loaded question. he'll get flamed for either choice
"the americans" is loosely based on a real russian spy couple. i can't comment on the accuracy of details, but i have read that the nature of much of the show's content is, if not accurate, at least plausible.
whenever i try and explain to people that a majority of people in crimea legitimately prefer being part of russia i just get called a putin shill :(
in other words soviet union was founded by biggest and most ruthless mafia in history.
i believe seeing the availability of all the food and the fact that normal people dressed in regular clothes came in and bought stuff without anyone bothering them shattered his world view of the soviet union.
i think it's sad, i'd like it if everybody (globally) had that and nobody could relate to what he's saying.
it's often a result of wanting to fit in. my father (chinese immigrant) has actually given me crap for not being interested in sports (because i'm not integrating into society properly). he's also rabidly anti-communist. it's also interesting that new converts to religions are often the most radical, since they have to prove they "belong."
my mom is (by birth) muslim and she doesn't understand why women wear hijabs in america. she thinks they need to assimilate.
i did not feel any guilt because i was trying to prevent the soviet union from bringing their system to the rest of the world. i felt that my work was defensive rather than offensive.
it's also unconstitutional since it violates constitutional prohibitions against illegal searches and seizure along with privacy rights violations. there's a good reason for those prohibitions since it prevents the same forms of tyranny and oppression that stalin once represented. it's important to remember that tyranny and oppression are not limited to communist societies alone. try to imagine the purges and executions that would have resulted in russia if stalin had nsa snooping and eavesdropping capabilities. that truly is chilling.
when you have the perspective he has, i imagine things that enrage us don't enrage him.
haha my dad liked that answer, and then was like, "you didn't already know that answer?" he's also a communist-escaper, different country and much later, but yeah.
and steinbeck's later work was slanted the other way - because he lived long enough to see the brutalities of the matured movement. he even offered to inform for the feds against the american communist party.
i think it depends on what you call "communism." many libertarian socialists point to things like the revolution in catalonia or the anarchists in ukraine as an example of "communism" but what they mean by communism is completely different than what the soviet union would call communist. ultimately they are separate ideas, but have a common word and heritage from the 1848 revolutions and the thinking that happened around then.
he may be an authoritarian but it's not even close to the brutality under stalin
i had a hungarian roommate who talked to herself loudly all the time (in hungarian). one time she screamed something with panic and desperation in the kitchen. i thought some accident was happening so i burst out of my room and into the kitchen, asked her what happened, and she replied "i'm all out of potatoes."
bulgarian here. you're labeled as a queer here if you sing while not drunk but we drink a lot so it equates out..
i'm not sure if it's a canadian thing or just my family but we all sing all the time. my girlfriend also hates it.
if one part of the country or population wants to leave the whole nation they can go a fully legitimate way to achieve that. just like scotland was trying to and maybe will try again. if the government of the ukraine (which is not only the current one but also the others since 1990) trys to prevent or prohibit such movements and votings i'm certain that indepency movements can call for aid from larger organisations like the oecd or the un. what's still not okay is using a hybrid war to sack this territory. and putin objectively lied about this in the beginning. because beside anything else the minority who doesn't want to be part of russia certainly won't feel too good about this. and a democracy has to look at the opinion of the many just as at the rights of the few.
look at the communist subreddits, there's plenty of people that act that stalin wasn't bad, mao was fine, and that the american prison system is similar to the gulag
it is so weird to look at these as a houston native... these pictures were taken specifically at a what is now a food town in clear lake (about 5 minutes from nasa jsc). the aisle he's standing in is now for beer lol.
i have a friend who escaped from russia in the 70s, sponsored by the uja. when her mother was finally able to come to america, she took her to a supermarket, and when she saw what was there, she burst into tears.
my family is cuban. the first time my mother saw an american supermarket she fell to her knees and wept.
he couldn't read english at all when he was first here. in the story about the first trip to a supermarket, he wasn't sure what the labels said, so he went by pictures. one of the first things he had was some sort of canned meat that had a picture of a cat as the brand. he said he heated it, ate it, and it was pretty good. yeah, it was cat food. the thing is that this guy who probably had recently been eating pretty decent food in the ussr didn't think it was especially good compared to stuff we won't eat at all.
it's beautiful though in the sense that so many people take this for granted, yet here he was standing in awe of free information and feeling the weight of what that really means.
i think it's depends on your background the most. i once knew a highly decorated american combat veteran. he grew up and fled post war vietnam as a child with his family and witnessed the worst of humanity all the way up to his arrival in america. living in america really opened his eyes and started a life long career in the military because of it. the dude was super appreciated of what a western nation gave him. it made him staunchly anti communist too. on the flip side i went to school with saudis who would shit on america while wearing all american designer clothes and smoking american cigarettes.
my father used to get punished for speaking italian in the house. my grandfather would throw a fit, it was absolutely forbidden to speak anything but english, even though he could only speak english very poorly. he told his children they had to teach him by talking. it's one reason why i'm so loathe about this modern multiculturalism view of integration that is supplanting the "melting pot" view. i think immigrants are great, but i also think it's fine to tell immigrants "your home culture sucked", and be somewhat critical of said culture (in the hope they join our culture). our current culture where it's almost taboo to criticize other cultures (socially), i don't think is very conducive to coaxing people to fit in and join the hegemony.
i got to see him on saturday night! he was brilliant.
you can also call bill clinton a rapist, though to be more accurate he is just an alleged rapist.
is it me or has the government stopped giving a fuck about the constitution?
seems to be a common theme amongst escapees from communism. cuban refugees are staunchly conservative (where marco rubio's family comes from)
i've noticed this trend too. anyone who has lived in a communist/socialist state absolutely detest that ideology. personally we had democratic socialism till 1991 in india. and i absolutely despise it. bernie support in reddit makes no sense to me as i have lived through it.
well people who've really felt the sting of socialism know what is really is as a matter of fact.
well almost every implementation of state communism has been based on marxism-leninism, which specifically advocates total state control and a ruling party as the way to achieve the stateless and classless society called communism. i think the end goal is mostly the same, but there are so many theories on how to go about it and many of them are specifically anti authoritarian and critical on leninism.
stalin is the guy who ate puppies for breakfast. putin is the kid on the playground who bullies smaller kids.
i'm canadian too. i sing (and growl/scream cause i'm a metalhead) to myself all the time. get a lot of funny looks.
the rest of us leftists hate the tankies just as much as the next guy.
to be fair, i did walk into a completely average kroger today and buy two fresh tenderloin steaks and an assortment of handsome produce to go with it for an entirely reasonable cost, in a few minutes. maybe shouldn't be taking that so much for granted either.
and the only memories as an american that i have of boris yeltsin are of a bumbling inebriated russian. whether it was true or not, that seems to be the way i remember him being portrayed in the us. i'd never heard this story before, it's kind of uplifting.
if it had been beer then he might not have looked so confused.
americans still have no concept of the plenty they take for granted. i know there are poor in the us - which should utterly shame a nation that has so much
got a very similar story from a old co-worker of mine. that when they came over he did the shopping till he found a job. then the first day on the job he had to leave the office because a super market called him and his wife was crying in an row.
yep i get it. :) maybe i should have replied that i find it to be a terrible beauty, that the world would be better off overall if nobody could know this particular beauty because literally everybody had it and took it for granted.
most of the saudis i've met abroad and in the us (who i imagine were on the upper-upper echelons of saudi society, and thus not a good representation) were very awful people. extremely materialistic, mysoginist, racist, etc. the elite in many middle eastern countries is just completely depraved.
really? i'm at an extremely liberal college in boston and everyone here is open to discussing cultural views. it's not taboo to criticize things in our home cultures at all - in fact, the vast majority of us acknowledge shortcomings in asian culture. however, i think it's 100% ok to still embrace parts of my heritage while shedding the uglier parts.
how old is he now? i've only seen stuff on youtube but that was from the late 80s.
well it depends how it's implemented. i live in a social democratic state where the government is actually running a relative tight ship. and i wouldn't dream of anything else. as a warehouse worker i can afford my own apartment, two cars, 5 weeks paid leave every year where i usually travel abroad and i can eat well and live well. all this thanks to the structure set up by a social democratic governance sprinkled with capitalism. norway btw.
"matured movement" - the end result of implemented marxism.
he also has like a billionaire family that most likely landed him the job
... and his mother is gloria vanderbilt? are you forgetting the part where his mother is the heiress to the railroads and worth over 200 million? that probably has a bigger part in cooper's being hired at cnn without formal education in the field than his cia internships. occam's razor, which is the more probable case? 1. anderson cooper lives a life of privilege by being one of the rich white male children of one of the most successful families in us history, getting things given to him that others would have to work incredibly, unfairly hard for 2. or, anderson cooper is a shadow-reporter for the cia after two internships packed him with the secret training he needed to coerce the american public's news consumption.
while the u.s. would probably not let texas secede, sarcastic redditors make it's desire to do so seem much greater than it actually is. there is zero chance texans would vote to do so, unlike other secessionist movements
wtf is a tankie? seen this word like a billion times today
i work with uzbeki woman who said that grocery store had such selection that it was debilitating. she was overwhelmed by the choices and something as simple as buying bread was really confusing. she said her first few trips to the store she left empty handed because she couldn't figure out what all the different products were.
well, to be fair, he did get stupidly drunk. edit, guys, this isnt me being cute, it's a well known story. there's pictures.
and instead we spend our time looking at pictures of cats.
norway doesn't have socialism. norwegian economy is actually quite deregulated. corporate and capital gains taxes are much lower in norway than the us. trade barriers are lower than us too. norway also has the fifth highest per capita oil wealth in the world. population wise it's barely a city state. governance is much easier as a result. socialist planning is much harder in larger economies. norway's economy is pretty straight forward. sociologially, norwegian population is pretty tight knit. this means collective bargaining amongst unions can be done with little conflict. this also means that norway doesn't need a minimum wage and it doesn't norway and us is apples to oranges comparison.
similar, perhaps, to lighting a single candle in a forest full of dry pine needles, while telling everyone, "my intention is for this candle and this candle alone to burn brightly and illuminate the forest." the candle is communism. the forest fire - and the resultant death and oppression of communist regimes world-wide - is the "matured movement". **edit - thank you for the gold, kind stranger.**
occam's razor is a 14th century philosophical principle which was meant to be applied to scientific hypotheses. it's bizarre that so many people on the internet seem to think it is somehow also applicable to social or political instances which could involve deception. there might even be some irony that someone is bringing up occam's razor in a thread about secret police and mock trials. i can just see some neckbeard russian asking his comrades "what is more likely...that there is an entire apparatus of secret police set up, and mock trials...or that vladimir got lost in the woods? occam's razor."
idk man i never supported my country's actions abroad, in fact i protested the war as a teen. i also don't support the annexation of sovereign territory. self-determination is important, so i think the people of the crimea should have called for a referendum and had the un oversee it to ensure no meddling by ukrainian or russian forces. that way the people of the crimea could join russia without russia violating ukraine's sovereignty. but fuck me, i'm american right? i can have an opinion on anything because my government does things that i disapprove of.
funny coming from iraq. they had just invaded our ally less than 10 years prior. also funny considering we overthrew a dictator and did not annex any of their territory.
what is this from? a quote from somewhere i presume..
well you're partly right but norway still have strong social democratic tendencies because of a powerful labor union, workers rights and state owned corporations to name a few. to be more precise you can define norway as a social democratic state with the nordic economic model. basically the best from socialism merged with the best from capitalism. i'm not saying it is a perfect system because it requires a government that is high functioning and low in corruption. and i'm not comparing it to the us, i'm just putting forward that there isn't something as socialism = bad just as there isn't something as capitalism = bad. that's something many people need to realize, especially those on the far left and right.
they did have a vote though (unofficial i believe) and it showed a large majority wanted to be part of russia. what most people don't seem to realize is how unstable ukraine is and who the people leading the country actually are. regardless of where you stand in the conflict you have to acknowledge that some of the ukranians in power are fascists and thus should not be invited to negotiations. then again, this is all about interests and nato would love having a base that close to russia whereas russia is strictly against that. ukraine itself is just a piece in this game.
although i'm more of a free market guy, i don't have anything against unions. collective bargaining between unions is a great way to set wages. this is the reason why norway doesn't have a minimum wage. unions in the us and india resort to rent seeking. this is as much a problem when corporations rent seek.
what is your favorite memory from your time with guns n' roses?
hi steven! thanks for doing this ama! which was the first "hooooooly shit we're huge" moment while on gnr?
hey steven, first off i'd like to say thank you for all the work thag you've done with gnr, adler's appetite, and adler. your drumming inspired me to become a drummer myself. my question is: do you have any advice for up and coming musicians?
steven, 4 questions - 1. i've noticed in gnr footage, you rising up off of the throne and coming down on the kick - is that you doing "heel toe" or another technique 2. is that how you got the nickname "popcorn"? 3. was that you that yelled "alright!" at the beginning of my michelle? 4. can we jam? :d love you man! thanks for being you!
what do you miss most about the rock n roll scene from the 80s compared to today?
hi steven, how surreal was it to be in a band with your friend growing up and make it big? does your mom have any funny/interesting stories about slash from when he was younger?
hey steven and deanna! thanks for doing this ama. question: is rock & roll dead once your generation is gone? if not, who is going to keep it going?
hi steven, if you had the choice to play any guns tune other than appetite/lies material, which one would you choose?
hi /u/steven_deanna_adler, could you please let us know if you could be mine was ever demo'd (as in, recorded in any form) during the appetite era?
what is your biggest regret about the years you lost to the hard drugs you took?
what's the worst experience you ever had with a fan?
when you guys finally broke out, i'm assuming you had a chance to meet alot of your idols. who exceeded expectations for you and who disappointed you when you met them?
hi steven your an amazing artist and your work with gnr is awesome! really good to hear that you were able to get clean, and that your mother helped you. mothers are the best, what do you think was the most important thing she did that helped you? also what are you listening to now in terms of music?
hey steven! love ya, man! what's your favorite gnr song to play?
do prefer sabian or zildjian? for my future cymbals preference
what songs did you play to when starting out as a drummer?
holy fuck, steven, you're the reason i ever started playing drums. which got me to playing other instruments, which got me to be the shitty musician i am today. i love your work man. what do you think is the coolest drum beat you've come up with to a song?
hey steven, i'm such a big fan of yours!!! i think you are the best drummer in the world and you are one of my biggest idols!! you are so inspirational to me as you have kept on going, no matter what! you are the type of guy that people will always admire. i love what you did for guns n' roses and the work that you've done since, my question for you is: what bands and/or artists are you a fan of??? love from saffron (17), uk xxx
how does it make you feel to know that the mega man x5 bosses were named after the members of guns n' roses?
hi steven, thank you for doing this! was there a drummer who inspired you to play while growing up? did you ever try to emulate that person?
how did you guys get back together? i heard that there was major rift between slash and axel.
hi steven, did duff really drink the amounts of alcohol he claims to have drank back in the old days?
i started playing drums at the age of 10 in 1987. needless to say you are a huge influence on me musically. i read your book and watched you on celebrity rehab and the thing that kept coming up was you wanting to get back with your band. so when i saw you walk out on the stage in nashville last year i don't think i've yelled louder for anybody ever. definitely a highlight of my life. my question is what is your set up now? what kind a drum set and cymbals are you playing now? what sizes? i hope to see you again in st. louis this year. thanks and keep smiling.
i wanna start a band with friends. what advice would you give me?
do you think gnr ever gonna release a new album? would you be a part of it?
you are often sporting a huge infectious smile, did deanna bestow this trait upon you?
were you ever in a marching band? what is your opinion on marching bands?
hex, is axel rose as big of a dick as he seems to be?
steven: the whole five years that we were together. every moment. it was magic. it was really magic. we couldn't do wrong and it was excitement 25 hours, 8 days a week. so, just being a part of those guys was great. it was like i was part of the cool kids in school. deanna: that was his family. when he was in a band, that was his family. and that was okay. steven: assholes. [laughter]
steven: when we played the street scene in 1986, downtown la. there were 100,000 people in the streets, outside, and we started playing. literally not 10s, or 100s, thousands of people were spitting on the stage at us. i was in the back, so i wasn't getting hit. the coolest thing was, nobody in the band got pissed off , they started spitting back at them. it was one of those moments like "holy shit! what am i doing here? how did i get here? and why is this so awesome!" deanna: i'm so glad i wasn't there. steven: that and playing with the rolling stones at the coliseum was pretty fucking cool!
steven: practice, practice, practice. repetition makes the master. stay away from alcohol and drugs and you can't lose. deanna: i agree with steven, especially about staying away from alcohol and drugs. he practices every single day. steven: alcohol and drugs are a waste of time. deanna: 3-4 hours a day he practices, even now. steven: that is because i love to play. always practice and play with everybody and anybody you can.
my michelle imo is the best g n r song they released. if you are scrolling, and have not heard this song, youtube it. nice, heavy guitar and drumming. sick rhythm
steven: all i know is that the gods of rock are pissed! i think i am afraid rock and roll might be dead. there are just no great bands out there. the last great band that i know of was the foo fighters, and that was 25 years ago. deanna: i don't believe it will ever die. when he was playing in the 80s, we would go on sunset blvd and see all these guys with the black leather jackets steven: but that was the 80s, this is 2017. music is completely different now. it sucks! deanna: a few weeks ago we were going down sunset blvd. there are so many young people. i don't think it will ever die. what goes around comes around, it's always gonna be there. i still listen to oldies but goodies. good music comes back.
steven: back off bitch, don't cry, you can be mine, coma, civil war.
steven: losing those years to the hard drugs and alcohol! it was a waste of time.
steven: hi u/fuck_you_in_the_valley this one girl, right after a show, i was walking to the bus and this one girl got so excited to see me that she jumped on me and pulled my back out. i had to miss like 10 shows because she hurt my back.
joses drumming on s.c.i.e.n.c.e. ... i always tried to get my starter kit to sound like that. tight snare, china and splashes ... those were the days.
i've read so much about incubus and never knew this. also noteworthy is how he has his drums facing sideways because of jon fishman's setup he had for phish in the mid 90s.
steven: every single one of them. i still play the ones that i recorded the demo tapes i helped write on "use your illusion". at least 12, 13 of those. i'll still practice to those because i love them so much, but obviously, i play em my way, which is the right way. deanna: steven is the greatest drummer in the world. he is my king. he is the best. steven: i'm the biggest asshole you're ever gonna fuckin meet. [laughter] deanna: no son, don't say that.
steven: u/mafiya_chlenom_k i owe no money to you. no money. well, yes. i've gotten better. the more you practice, you know. like i said in the past, the repetition makes the master. when i first started doing "appetite for destruction", the timing on that, you cannot use a metronome to that record. it will not work. it was all feel. back when i was younger, i didn't have that much of a grasp on what timing really is. it was more about just having fun and kicking ass. and now, i'm more into learning a lot of style and perfecting myself. so, i'm practicing a lot more and watching more like buddy rich. i watch a lot of him playing and i'm just practicing that song. i'm definitely a lot better. i'm way more comfortable and repetition makes the master.
i asked him about his set up. he plays a brand called soultone cymbals. never heard of them but i'm gonna get some now.
steven: my favorite songs, like i said earlier, were kiss, queen. i loved disco. i loved jazz. i love 70's rock. i love 60's rock. just music that made me feel good, that i still listen to today and i still practice today. it's so cool. you just go on the internet and get 70's hits, ya know, a collection of all these different 70's songs. and i went this one, this one this one, and i picked all these different ones, so i got all these great songs i practice to and they're such great songs 'cause they're stories about something that's meaningful. nowadays, i listen to these bands and for one, you can't understand what they're saying, two it doesn't mean anything. i just like a good story and something that makes my heart feel good. and then 30, 40 years later i listen to it and i still get that euphoria. i love rock.
steven: dude, i'm sure you kickass if you've been playing that long. keep practicing. repetition makes the master, as i say many times, which is true. what's my favorite drum beat i came up with? there's "rocket queen, there's "welcome to the jungle", there's "mr. brownstone". deanna: "paradise city" i like. steven: "paradise city" is a great one. every song i recorded with them i love. it was my favorite. deanna: and because he loves them i love them all too.
steven: right now, i'm just practicing, having fun, and enjoying my life. i have my beautiful wife, my beautiful dogs and i just enjoy being at home and being with them. i have like 6 really good friends and i enjoy hanging out with them. so, if something does come up that i'm really interested in. there is one band that might be looking for a drummer. i'm not gonna mention their name because i have a habit of saying things and then it jinxes it, but if it does come up, it happens. if it doesn't, then so be it. that's totally cool, too.
steven: no, my grandmother did. my grandma always said, "a please and a thank you and a nice smile will get you far". deanna: i did it. not my mother. steven: grandma did everything. deanna: i did it. no! she never smiled. steven: she hated everybody, but me. deanna: she only smiled at steven. steven: she hated everybody, but me. deanna: my mother had 14 grandchildren and the only one she cared about was this one, steven. that's the only one. it was amazing. people would see him and they would cry because they are so beautiful. it's true! steven: and this is what you grow up into
i would recommend checking out tommy stinson's interviews that mention axl (he's one of the longest running members of gnr, been with axl for 18 years). he called him misunderstood and somewhat of a perfectionist but he wasn't negative about him.
i still watch the "live from the ritz" special from '88 or whatever it was at least once a year. you guys had a very special moment there - there was an energy and danger that was so purely rock & roll - i'm not sure that it's been matched by anyone in the 29 years since... guns wasn't ever nearly as electric in any other incarnation - you five are the real band.
as an addict who hasn't done heroin in 15 months, thanks for this response. i agree with every word.
early this morning, my niece and nephew lost their father due to an overdose. he has been battling addictions for the 16 years he was with their mother - and even though he seemed to have been doing better these last two years, something triggered him over the weekend in to a vicious relapse, which ended as it did this morning. seek help - go to meetings - your life means something to someone no matter what you think.
as a recovering addict of (almost) 3 and a half years and now currently dealing with my girlfriend struggling to stay clean... thank you, i really needed to read this. gives me some hope and helps me calm down a bit. you guys are awesome, thank you! :d
can someone give this context? why were people spitting at them? just genuinely curious, thanks for doing this ama btw :d
i saw that show! living color opened and it ruled! (everyone said gnr actually outplayed the stones, though they were great too).
i was at that stones concert back in '89 at the colosseum. you guys kept me waiting for hours! it was worth it...the show fucking rocked.
weird.. i thought drugs and alcohol made my music better :(
this about the lawyer, mr. louis cypher. i'm sure there were so many people like that in show business. seriously, who does that?
you should check out the band ghost if you haven't. they rock pretty fucking hard.
coma is my favorite gnr song. it feels damn good to share the opinion with one of the originals, especially since i feel like coma goes completely unnoticed by most people
you can be mine is a personal favorite, thanks!
when you say terminal drug addiction how many years is that exactly ?
you mean sideways in orientation to the rest of the band mates? also style wise in the article above near the end, jose noted how he hated the look of metal kits with toms tilted towards he player, preferring the aesthetics of a flatter orientation that's easier to rim shot.
please release those demos with your playing if you have them! with all respect to matt who did a fine job, these demos would be the holy grail.
musicians didn't quit making good music, or stop making songs without meaning...? you just quit trying to find it.
congratulations! definitely a hard road. had a friend who was doing opiates (oxy and the like) before i knew him. he always says the most important step is to cut off your connections with your old drug using friends, which can obviously be difficult. that and finding new purposes and goals in life. hope all is and will go well for you.
congrats!!! i'm four years clean from heroin!! keep going man!! i'm in school getting a psyd. my life is totally different now! just don't use. you can always msg me if u need to talk.
thank you for this. it says a lot of what i need to hear right now as i'm struggling with a fairly similar situation and have had this on my mind a lot this week. i wish the best for you (and him).
former heroin addict that has ruined my fair share of relationships even though it was the last thing i wanted. i just couldn't shake the dope. this is so incredibly eye opening and poignant. how would you feel if he reached out and apologized because after reading this there is a girl i really want to apologize to? i haven't talked to her in years though and she's married and i'm happy for her. i don't want anything else but to really apologize.
thanks for writing this. i feel the same way about my dad. i want him to be better so much, but he doesn't want to get better himself. he thinks he can keep drinking and everything will be fine, and blames it all on the disease without taking any personal responsibility for it. it's more than just a disease. there is an element of personal choice. the disease doesn't take you to the liquor store, pour your glass, and force it down your throat. it just makes you want to do that really really bad, and maybe even makes you feel terrible if you don't do it. but everything i've learned says that as an addict you have to make a conscious choice to be better if you want to get better. you can't just wait for the circumstances around you to change for you to magically get over your problem.
i am not a fan of na at all because of the way they reject evidence based medicine so i appreciare you posting alternatives. people really think na is the only way and it is actually one of the less effective ways. (i say this as somebody who has been part of several groups and now run a mata group. maintenance meds saved my life.)
thank you thank you thank you. my husband is an addict. i didn't know there were options outside of na/aa. i'll be sharing these links and hoping he explores these meetings.
secular organizations for sobriety is not a good source. i suggest using another source instead of that one. fraudulent websites like using it in order to draw in members.
serious answer: probably out of respect. punk bands back in the day used to get this all the time, and gnr had strong punk influences.
when someone identifies as a dilophosaurus, they sometimes spit what they think is venom at what they assume to be prey.
are u kidding? doctors do it all the time. if you're ever in the hospital and a strange dr. pokes their head in the door and says hi, well you'll be getting a bill for his/her services. guaranteed.
even izzy, slash, and axl rose. when i call you put them all on hold
yeah, i think the only difference is that rock isn't the most popular genre anymore. there are still phenomenal rock bands out there even though all the kids are listening to edm and hip hop.
seriously. i fucking hate this mentality. i don't care how successful of a musician says it, it's total bullshit. it's just this arrogance that seems to often come with seeing major success as a musician. yeah dude, out of all the countless people creating music (and honestly, many of them more talented than him), there exists absolutely no good music? yeah, okay, buddy...
so much great music being made now and the foreseeable future. it's not on the radio or in the record/cd/tape store - it's at our fingertips. just gotta know what to look for. however, if folks are content with the music they grew up with and it makes them happy. good for them.
thank you... i'm sorry to hear this is happening to you and the person you love. there's so much pain, all around... that time is a while back for me now, but - i didn't go to al anon, but i got a *lot* of support from soberrecovery.com, where there's a section for friends and family of alcoholics, as well as for people struggling with addiction (just as another option). best of luck to you xoxo
i have no idea how she'd react, but i would definitely appreciate an apology. i think it would be very good to make it clear that you don't want anything from her. she may or may not respond, but you can only try. best of luck to you.
thanks for the serious answer. (and to everyone else who answered) it's hard to understand how spitting could be a sign of respect but hey, today i learned something new :)
the worst part about 'nam was the dilophosauruses. they'd sneak up on you from behind, and then shoot you in the back with their ak48s, which were one better than ak47s.
i mean the guy spells command with one m. what do you want from him?
i made it through work without using today! of course the first thing i did when i got home was...
side fun note: primus (who has some of the best chunkybass(tm) ever ((thanks les!)) expects that the crowd will yell "primus sucks!" i know it seems counter-intuitive, but it gives a sense of reverence and love when you can yell at the band "you suck!" before/during a concert. jerry was a race car driver.....
what am i missing in this exchange? who is everyone?
...to rearrange the letters in oral sex properly. fun fact.
i was 13 years old and this album was the only thing i asked for at christmas. my parents refused and got me a huey lewis and the news record instead. i still haven't forgiven them. hip to be square, my ass!
how long is work? add an hour tomorrow. then another soon. i don't know you but i am here for you. you're my hero right now. do everything you can do not to use today. no matter how far you make it, if you tried your hardest, it's enough
progress not perfection my friend. it's an accomplishment to not have used during work! it means that you're moving in the right direction. for me, i had to seriously commit to taking things one thing at a time, taking life in one hour at a time. when i really wanted to use i would literally tell myself that i can use in an hour if i still want to. that hour came and i committed to another hour, and so on. i did whatever i had to do to not use, no matter what. i tell myself that all the time. today i'm not going to use, no matter what.
shit i'm 32 months clean and from my journey in recovery this is some great advice. if all you did today was not use, then it was the best day of your life. you can control the day, nothing else.
do you actually engage the poachers yourselves at anytime or leave it up to the rangers? are the rangers local? and if you do engage with them what kind of firearms do you use (assuming that you do use them for at least defensive purposes). btw - great work that you are doing out there!
how does the local culture respond to you being there? do they understand the plight of the poachers? is there a sense of local conservation?
where should i start looking for a job involving protecting animals in for example africa ? i got two weeks left of my 1 year military training with 6 months of international peacekeeping education. i think that can be of use? otherwise i have graduated 3 year gymnasium in sweden.
hello, did microsoft do anything to try to make up for this? did they contact you and offer aid or anything?
how do you feel about ecotourism as a way to combat poaching?
what aircraft do you usually use for support operations?
as the it guy what is your list of ideal technology supplies/ solutions? ie: * free highspeed internet * aerial drones with limited cargo capacity * better computers * animal tracking software/equipment i suspect some people are going to volunteer assistance so why not get the list out there. dream big, as you never know what people specialize in or have access too.
besides bandwidth, what is your biggest challenge doing it for this organization?
in your photo album, the first image (of all the confiscated loot), there's a whole bunch of papers. what are they? also, what do you do with seized animal pelts?
why did you decide to do what you are doing? what's your biggest goal? and biggest fear?
it seems like quadcopters with cameras could be very useful to you guys -- have you thought about investing in them? they're not terribly expensive.
apart from getting shot at, what's the most challenging part of aviation in this part of the world?
so i've heard of ex war vets being hired as 'poacher poachers', getting paid to get around and blast apart people poaching animals. this would have been 2-3 decades ago. was this industry practice then or now? would you like to take an ak to someone you caught chopping off a rhino horn?
why is ivory burnt? why isn't it sold for a very low price to destroy the market for poachers. my dad told me that they killed the market for peregrine falcon chick that were sold in the arabian peninsula for hunting. by selling chick 300 instead of 3000 for a couple of years. in just a few years they were able to save the falcons living in our region. every time he sees ivory being burnt, he says it's a shame that politicians and some environmental association might benefit from poaching and the black market. how much is done in educating people consuming ivory?
what would you rather save from being poached? one horse sized duck or a hundred duck sized horses?
are there cases when the poachers tried to shoot atone of the aircrafts?
it's one thing to combat the poachers actually killing the animals and gathering the ivory. do you ever have run-ins with the actual buyers of the ivory or even corporations that purchase the ivory? what you are doing is affecting their bottom line so i would assume there would be a natural resistance from people like them.
what would you consider the most rewarding moment you've had on the job?
i have a piano with ivory keys from the 1870's, so obviously it wasn't illegal then. what are the best ways to recycle and use the ivory we currently have, without having to hunt for more?
how do you ensure the security and safety of your camp and equipment against rebels and other human intruders? also, how many rangers are you able to train and support in the bush at a given time?
hi! why do you use windows instead of ubuntu or another linux based os?
so will you guys be sticking with windows for the future, maybe with automatic updates disabled? or are you considering alternatives? certainly ubuntu would never do something like this to you.
1. what got you interested in the job in the first place? 2. what are some challenges you face living in such a remote area? 3. do you ever get scared for your life doing your job? 4. are there any other it problems you face out there? thanks for your service against poachers!
have you considered applying for a grant from the gates foundation?
do poachers bail at the first sign of armed resistance?
what's the best and worst experiences you've had in your line of work?
what other technology do you and the rangers bring into the field? who would you say genuinely has the upper hand on this facet, the rangers or the poachers? any signs of escalation on their part?
is it mostly elephants and rhinos in danger or are all animals in danger of poaching?
what punishment do the poachers get if caught and to what level does corruption affect you operation?
have you considered using drones? not as a replacement, of course, but as a complement to the ulm. they could provide you with many advantages; they could provide additional support, cost much less to run and could add a big surprise factor when needed. i worked with drones in a few of africa's more unstable countries so if you have questions, feel free to pm me.
1) how often (in your experience) does poaching occur and at what times in the day? 2) do you see patterns in different poachers, and do you have a way to predict when someone may attack?
what do you find the most difficult to deal with day-to-day? what problems do you find recurring that other countries or people don't have or take their solutions for granted? thanks for the work you're doing and good luck out there! stay safe man!!
what's your opinion on the fake rhino horns being introduced into the black market to hinder the value of the real rhino horns? do you think it will substantially reduce poaching?
what does your day usually look like? do you have a routine? do you have traditions?
you guys are in the central african republic where there's a genocide going on in an area bordering two massive war zones. how do you guys stay safe?
what is it like being so far from home? does the staff there get homesick? i would think it would be pretty hard to get days off to go visit friends and family back home. also, may i recommend never10? it will permanently disable windows version change via permission (it's less than 1mb of data and all it does is change the registry to stop the version change updates, it's similar to what businesses and schoolboard use to limit updates to their machine). you can have your it guys look at it, but it's really simple, keep up the good job!
what is the one thing you would like the people in developed countries to do to help eliminate poaching?
there's an argument that the best way to stop poaching is to recognise that wildlife has value and to allow some form of property rights over wild populations in exchange for managing those populations. obviously something like this is completely at odds with what you're trying to achieve, but how effective do you think it would be on the ground if it was the norm across africa?
what fuel do your aircraft use? what kind of storage facility do you have for the fuel, and how long can it be stored before becoming "dirty"?
my question is actually about antarctica. what's it like to live there? are there any actual permanent towns?
i saw a doc on pbs about a small african tribe. this was further west than op is, i think. more towards nigeria. they cut down a huge tree (like 5~~"~~' diameter, 100+ feet tall) to get to a beehive for the honey. the filmmakers asked them about conservation, working in balance with nature, etc to see if it was really worth cutting down such a large tree. they had no grasp of the concept at all.
look at the iapf. they're a military centric foundation that trains local rangers in zimbabwe. they're usually on the lookout for former military members as instructors.
i haven't heard from microsoft in an official capacity.. however i was contacted by an employee of theirs that understands and appreciates our plight and what we do. he was nice enough to escalate my post within their pr department, but with no promises obviously. we'll see if anything comes of it.
eco tourism is a pretty wide concept. we are focusing first on stabilizing the region and gaining enough control of the area to hopefully in the future turn this into a park for tourism to begin.
normally, we will fly 4-5 hours a day using the ulm. with this ultralight we can support our rangers with surveillance and supply them thru airdrops. the cessna 206h that we have remaining is more for longer flights. (like to and from the nearby towns and capitol).
i'm asking the staff what their top 3 wishes would be... * drones with unlimited cargo capacity would be great (care of our logistics guy). * free internet would be a huge boon. but there isn't even a tower out here.. satellite is all we've got * as for animal tracking... a fleet of helicopters + fuel for 10 years. :) to be honest, the technology available is always changing. so when we have funds available to supplement our stock we make those determinations through research at the time. it's another way of saying i don't have anything specific to ask for. thanks though
i'm actually not the it guy!! i was supposed to be the pilot, however since the ulm aircraft had it's accident right as i arrived, i've tried to help where i can. as for the it work.. it's been a lot of cleanup. there was a large storm before i arrived that ripped the roof of the control room's building right off.. taking most of the wiring and devices with it! it's taken a while, but i got them limping and then pretty much back in service.
that was actually medication for the sudanese cattle to protect against local diseases. as for the pelts, we burn them.
most of the year, i actually work in antarctica. but having been a bush pilot for many years, i still want to fly during the off-ice season. there are not many places you can go to do a short term contract for flying. this just worked out great.
me and bill haven't had a chance to speak yet :) if we did, i'd tell him i miss him at the helm of microsoft. also, having worked in east africa in the medical field.. i would thank him for all he's done.
classic shell and a healthy fear of updates. not like my job here is stressful already.
the main concern is range and time. the chinko reserve is 17,600 sq/km! the weather patterns and terrain would just make that unfeasible.
as a son of a bush pilot, i would say dealing with having thermals one second and then dealing with a straight vicious downdraft.
actually, the last thing we want is a violent confrontation. we would prefer to arrest poachers, and try to convince invasive sudanese herders to help us keep this park pristine.
you know, once in world of warcraft i had a genius idea of flooding the market with "bags". "bags" were always in constant demand, and cost a pretty penny. so i started making them and selling them very cheap! only to find out... they were being bought and then resold at a higher price. number wise. if a bad lets say goes for 20$ and i sell mine for 5$, then whoever wants to make money, just buys them at 5$ and sells them again for 20$. by selling confiscated ivory cheaply, you are essentially cutting out the middle man (the poacher) and at the end, the end buyer wins.
we like the idea.. the only issues are how far we would need them to go.. the chinko reserve is 17,600 sq/km! it's just not feasible for our operation. the weather patterns and terrain are also a big hinderence. the americans are setup in a place not far called obo tracking kony's army. they have tried this very thing but the "triple canopy" of the bush is just too thick. nice thought though
my ama dream is now complete.. i can answer this. the staff disagrees, but i'm going to say the horse sized duck. i will then lead the rangers myself atop this steed and scare the ever living shit out of the poachers.
due to security reasons.. we prefer not to discuss our tactics or give away positions/quantity of active rangers. hope you understand.
this is not a huge operation.. and it's scarcely 2 years old. this is the bush.. the real bush. you work with what you have available and what this staff has done, and created to this point is very impressive. it would be nice to have an it staff that could design, build, and maintain such a system. i don't know where they got the machines.. but i assume donations with windows already installed. the staff has larger concerns to focus on with the anti-poaching efforts and os takes a backseat.
honestly, the ulm just seems perfect for what we do, but i'd have to defer to the boss on this. he has done more research than i :)
i know i answered this above.. but basically the range we need to cover is too large and for too long a time. hell, just the charging is an issue. we run soley off generator and solar power.
1) the majority of the poaching occurs in the dry season (mid dec - mid march). during daylight hours. 2) as stated before, we are preferring not to discuss our tactics for security concerns & success of our mission.
hi chinko! after learning about your mission and your internet and connectivity trouble, i called our ceo directly and we would like to extend the full resources of our firm to help in any capacity we can. we have a network and telecommunications firm headquartered in georgia (usa), and have engineers and managers that specialize in remote and satellite connectivity. if your connectivity is causing trouble in any way, we would like to work with you on some possible solutions. send me a pm.
is there vsat coverage there? i know in the marine industry, we pay for a fixed speed and bandwidth is unlimited. iirc a fixed 2 mbps was around 3000 - 5000 us and 5 was something like 8-10 000 per month. it also came with voip with very reasonable rates depending on the county being called. the rates could usually be negotiated and could probably find cheaper providers.
what would your organization needs to get better internet? talking about device and/or infrastructure? or what prevent you from getting faster internet?
do i absolutely have to pay money just to view a description of the openings? i registered an account and the job openings are still behind a paywall.
at least there's that. maybe hearing about critical operations being interfered with, especially ones where lives can be put at risk will make them realize that their upgrade strategy isn't winning any hearts. it's a far shot, but i hope at least you guys get some form of compensation.
that makes sense, i always heard ecotourism suggested as an ultimate goal to help support the local economy and wildlife. i hope that you are able to get the stability you need.
i am a pilot as well, recently got my multi commercial and almost finished with my single commercial add on. so, how does a person go about getting a job flying in africa working for wildlife conservation? it seems to me a far more worthwhile task than flying boxes for some small time part 135 operation and flying in africa is a notion i've entertained in my mind a few times.
that made me have an idea. buy some gopros and attach them either to the heli or your helmet, start a youtube channel. could be some excellent pr and help raise funds if you link to a crowdfunding page.
now this is what i want to hear. :) thanks for the response. people have odd hobbies, i know a few drone fanatics for example. if predator drones can drop bombs i'm sure they can drop other less immediately explosive items. (beans and bullets).
why dont you put them back in the market? i know i dont know anything, but just a first impression is there is always the market for these pelts. so by destroying it just increases prices and thus risk/reward leading to higher violence. not only that but the damage.. is already done, so by selling them back into the market you get a high cash bonus to help try to protect more again, i have literalry no understanding of your job. would be intresting to know more about yours
hasn't bill already done a ton of charity in africa? sounds like this story would be pretty close to home for him...
general it, av, security, network/wifi, desktop, printer. i'm an it manager so i have a very broad set of skills vs being very refined and focused at any of them. i focus more on people, business, projects, etc. except still know plenty to get my hands dirty, and would love to be out in the world helping.
it's good to have reminders how spoiled i am with jet ways, paved strips, apus and packs
one of reddit's many sketchers should jump on this and draw you and your crew riding a duck-pegasus.
as co-owner of a small it company here in the uk, if you ever need anything in terms of help for your it, just let me know and we'll do whatever we can.
oh some .50s and plate of armor would do just fine, cmon :)
we do abide by all local and national laws. we do everything by the book, if for no other reason than we depend on the support of the local population. as for engagement.. definitely defensively. *edit*: adding to the answer.. as for what the laws are.. they are strict and sometimes obtuse, so we have to be careful. i personally don't know them all to tell, but for instance.. there is a law that says you can kill a trespasser's cow, but not take the cow. that would be stealing...
you should try contacting through there email/website
this kind of stuff is absolutely a testament to the power of connectivity. incredible
holy cow those prices are high... but to get internet in the middle of the ocean...
they're in the middle of nowhere, there are no cell towers or any other way of accessing the internet. satellite is literally all they can access
as others have commented, we are truly out in the middle of nowhere. satellite is what we have and i'm not a good enough it guy to know the other options :) however, many people made suggestions in the previous post that i'll be going thru once i have time to sort thru 3500 comments!
they don't know that they are endangered.. it's a food source. they have a hard time believing that it can run out! they think it is an unlimited supply of wildlife.
an elephant tusk will go for somewhere around $2,000 a kilo in china, and a single tusk weighs somewhere around 65 kilos. that's $260,000 from one elephant where the mean income for a person is $320. that's equivalent to $4.2 million in usd. many understand the plight of the elephant but the money is too good for them to not care.
are you clicking an ad? i can read the description and apply
i remember news stories of hospital equipment upgrading the first week they did this. they don't care then, they don't care now.
i actually did a lot of research on eco tourism during my undergrad. tl;dr of what i learned is eco tourism is a great option for a lot of countries to very sustainably support their economy and promote other countries to try do the same. why destroy for the sake of profit when you can preserve for the sake of profit? unfortunately, in all the months i worked on this project i only came across 2 eco tourism locations that employed truly sustainable practices. everything else had the label of eco tourism but was really just another resort destination, only now in a more remote area. still always tons of waste produced, tons of energy used, no interaction with local community, etc.
you know, i became a pilot with the sole intention of becoming a bush pilot. i left the us after i got my commercial and started traveling the world. i just put myself out there.. sought out local flying orgs, hung at airports, made connections in the towns. it wasn't until i found myself in a coffee shop in tanzania that the owner gave me the contact info for a local flying medical service. i made a quick phone call, met them for dinner, joined them for a 3 day clinic with the masai tribes.. and that was it. i joined up. once i had the experience under my belt.. it was only a matter of finding organizations in need. there are several bush pilot facebook groups that are good for this.
they're becoming more popular but there's still a issue with cost vs endurance and the learning curve for training. most commercial uavs don't have the endurance or payload required until you start spending a lot of money on suavs, like $40,000+... at that point you could almost get a ultralight which would have a much longer loitering time.
start a youtube channel while all they have is slow, expensive satellite internet?
indentured technician, for those unfamiliar with the industry.
after a long stint in antarctica.. trees, greenery, animals, stars & the moon are all amazing. it's nice.
our most recent flick was samurai cop!! also.. it's the only movie we have... on vhs.. with no rewinder.
the gates foundation works primarily on healthcare, with focuses on women's health, family planning and innovations that increase hygienic standards in poorly developed countries. they do a lot of good, but i don't think they would step out into elephant conservation. they have enough on their plate already in the fid of public health
wow, thansk for the great writeup. unfortunately this is our first time trying crowdfunding. i'm trying to answer these questions right now, but edited the fundraiser to make sure people know they can donate any amount.
i'm in comp sci so when i see apu my head goes to arithmetic processing unit... curious what it stands for in this context.
yea... i would think that someone illegally poaching in the middle of nowhere would be more likely to shoot first and then be able leisurely make their escape.
they are still around.. the americans come buy often & the ugandan army. the lra is not defeated, but they also aren't what they were
you have to tag them to summon them. this seems most appropriate for /u/awildsketchappeared .
just imagine what google's balloon project would do to those costs. btw, how is that project? haven't heard of it in a long time.
could they build a tower with enough funding? i have no idea how it works, it's magic signals that connect me to the world.
the only other wireless option would be microwave, but that is line-of-sight. it doesn't work for more than about 20 miles.
i think for local tribes consumption it's "limitless" supply of food. they have live off it since ancient time. their breeding/reproducing speed can cover local tribe consumption. poacher made them endangered.
in terms of ivory, is it possible to tranquilize and de-tusk elephants? i've heard of conservation efforts in doing so with rhinos. the idea being, if the animals don't have any ivory, there isn't incentive for the poachers to kill them. obviously not an ideal solution, but would it impact their health/lifestyle too significantly to be a viable option?
shit, i didn't know the size of the economic incentives til now. that's insane. you don't have to educate the villagers. you have to educate the fucking chinese about voodoo quack medicine.
yeah, but the poacher isn't getting 250k for that tusk. i'm sure he gets paid heavily for taking down the elephant, but it's nowhere near thst amount. the ivory is upsold every time it changes hands, which is why it ends up 2k a kilo on the street. similar to how large drug syndicates in south america pay locals like 5 bucks a day to go forage for cocoa leaves, those leaves will become a kilo of cocaine worth $1,800 in colombia and $20,000 in houston, $30,000 in nyc and $50,000 in london. people sell drugs and illicit commodities like ivory to make **untaxed profit**.
and simalarly to the drug market, going after the suppliers doesn't do anything but raise the price and bring in more suppliers. as long as there's money to be made people will risk it. if you want to combat the problem effectively you have to be willing and able to attack the demand side.
i'm on a plane already and haven't paid a dime yet
shouldn't hospitals be using the enterprise version?
forgot about that. i was hoping a class action suit would form against ms for this, not so much to get recompense, but to get them to stop this bullshit. if it were a major hospital, i would expect them to use an enterprise or embedded version of windows, but that's ridiculous nonetheless.
all of the bad pr was most likely factored into the decision to go ahead with this upgrade strategy.
what were the two locations? having spent some time in kenya i saw how large a positive impact safari tours can have. i'm not clear why this model wouldn't work in all of africa.
they could send sd cards by mail and upload it in a other city.
actually i am not a cfi. i got my commercial certs and immediately left for ecuador :)
wait....stars and the moon aren't visible on antarctica? ever?
well, seeding on torrents/setting up a plex might be the thing everyone on reddit could do for your it concern's...
please, for your own sake, take 5 minutes to add the extra tiers now in between answering questions. you don't even need to spend much time adding clever descriptions or figure out the numbers that i mentioned before, just at least add the tiers ($1, $7, $15, $25, $50, $100, and $250) with a couple of words to indicate how important your work is. strike while the iron is hot, this ama will likely be seen by tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people who are primed with interest in your story, many of whom will be eager to donate to such a worthy cause.
yeah i wouldn't exactly call that easy for a group with very little money and nobody with linux experience - you're reinforcing my point that it's ridiculously hard to do ***with no internet***. like, they can't just head to an internet cafe or anything, and you can't just order new stuff off amazon and get it in two days. yeah, it's feasible, but it requires significant investment in time and man hours. i love foss and the linux community but it's really not as simple as booting up an ubuntu live cd and making some wine tweaks.
you don't even need that. just imagine if a company like spacex reduces launch costs to under 20 million dollars and companies can put way more satellites up for cheaper. that directly reduces the cost you need to charge.
it's not just medicine, ivory is used extensively in jewelry, furniture, and many other luxury goods where it's traded.
this is the root cause right here. i wonder if what they really need is a media campaign in china and other markets where elephant product is sold. a widespread campaign that can educate people on lack of of actual medical benefits of the tusk, and maybe a counter intelligence campaign to spread misinformation about how elephant tusk is bad for you or attracts bad spirits or whatever it is they would need to hear to put them off of it. i think that could potentially be a real part of the solution. stopping poachers is good, but that doesn't fix your demand problem. and if you get too good at stopping poachers but not fixing the demand problem, it will actually work against you because you'll continue to drive the price up. i wonder if there's anything like that in the works.
drugs are a bit different. i doubt many people are suckin dick for ivory figurines.
i just got there and they gave me money when i arrived.
yes, yes they should. tbh i have no sympathy for (big) businesses who aren't using enterprise that complain about windows trying to upgrade to w10.
that last point is basically it. life critical machines shouldn't be running consumer grade software. it's simply not created for that and is treated as such by its developers.
i hope they do file. this kind of "you don't own the software, just a license, so we can do whatever we want" bullshit fuckery started with drm and ip law and has only gotten worse from there. disputing the nature of ownership is one thing, interfering with operations at a whim is another.
one place i went is the santa lucia cloud forest reserve in ecuador. fantastic place, they do their best to be sustainable.
that might push them into more of a seasonal format, unless they can get a good timetable worked out. not that there's anything wrong with seasonal stuff. that actually sounds pretty cool..
no dummy.. it's at the bottom of the earth. haven't you looked at a map?
disagree entirely. individual users of older operating systems make a choice to be on the the older, less secure os. microsoft's job is to make their newer offerings secure enough that the existence of the old stuff can't compromise them. you know, if the military chooses not to upgrade (as in your example), then that is probably a policy decision for the military to sort out.
got it.. my brain is a bit fried.. but made some generic reasons for each level. i appreciate the info
this may not be a popular opinion, but i've gleaned that the chinese culture is one that greatly values wealth and opulence, sometimes to a vicious degree. i've heard it mentioned a few times that if you're a man in china without a "good" job, women will openly mock you. i suspect that the chinese people that buy ivory have little concern for the animals in africa. they care only for their precious status symbol. please feel free to tell me i'm wrong about this.
it's actually a misconception that they purchase ivory primarily for medicinal usage. the majority of poached ivory in china is used for decorative purposes. generally they have the ivory intricately carved into some work of art, which is then placed on display in their home or office. the rarity and high cost associated with ivory is what makes it so coveted, as owning a nice piece, or gifting such an item grants one a tremendous amount of *face* in their culture.
i just got my 4th confirmed poacher kill and was awarded with a rhino harem.
i just arrived and they paid me 2 live rhinos already. i don't even know where i'll keep them.
critical equipment should be nailed down on versions, even non-critical software should imo as changes can have unforeseen consequences
the minimum enterprise licenses that ms will sell is 500 at one time. a hospital does not need 500 windows licenses pretty much ever. there is no direct upgrade, either. so, i'm not surprised at all that most businesses don't use enterprise edition and it is not a reasonable expectation.
i don't mind the "you own a license" part of it so much, it's the "you clicked x, so you accept," "i know you disabled the gwx update, so here's another one," "oh, btw, we found *expensive program* to be incompatible with 10, so we uninstalled it for you :)" kinds of bullshit that has me hating ms, but yeah the license to use vs own thing is arguably a part of it as well.
this is correct. and as with travelling to australia, you will also need training in how not to fall of the earth once down there.
a lot of asia is like that. my first time visiting korea to go see family was surprising. a lot of women will keep bags from high end stores and use them to daily carry things just so they can be seen in public with them. anything name brand is automatically better than something that isn't regardless of actual results/tests. and like you said, people with certain jobs are just looked down upon.
solution: flood the market with knockoffs. if only we had a place nearby where we could get a bunch of cheap, mass produced knockoffs made...
i just killed my 7th and i can now call in an air strike.
people who can't see beyond themselves or beyond today. "i got mine. fuck the rest of you."
dear god, i thought america was getting ridiculous!
surely that would make the genuine stuff more valued and drive prices up again, making ivory more coveted.
when was your first "this is going to work out" moment?
which country's box has been your favorite? what about your favorite snack (that came from a box)
what's your best advice for someone starting a new business , with very little cash, like yourselves?
i had no idea that you guys were this small! i heard about you folks from tb's unboxing of your stuff and always thought this was a really neat business. how do you folks decide what to put in your boxes?
for how long the average customer keeps his subscription?
how did you produce your first few boxes? apart from the sacrifice of time involved, what surprised you most about starting your business?
congrats first of all! these 7 digits are, i believe, the revenue. what about your net profit? are you planning on investing into the company or investing in assets?
what kind of contract did you and your boyfriend set up? is it own 50/50 by you two? how has it affected your personal relationship with each other? what happens if you two want to take the company in very two different approaches? i'm asking because everything on reddit says not to mix personal and business together. so what's your secret to making it work? thanks!
how do you get the snacks/candies from various countries? i know most english stores i go to mark up like crazy, supposedly due to import costs, so how do you keep the cost down and affordable to make it profitable to send out all these snacks, especially when you first started?
did we just crash your site? i was so excited to gift one. should we check back tomorrow or have we taken all your nomnoms now?
thank you for doing this. i am just starting out in ecommerce and am just finishing building my shopify site. my question to you is, what forms of marketing did you use other than reddit? did you 2 learn to use facebook ads? seo? what would you say was the best form of marketing regarding sales? thanks a ton!
your website got the reddit hug of death, so i can't look up the info. but, how much is each box?
long-term, do you believe your yum boxes will be able to get you through to retirement? i love the idea of your product, but as with most things, it can be tough to see sustained sales/growth, soon guess, i'm mainly wondering if you have any thoughts you'd share about your "next steps"?
what are you going to do when you run out of countries?
what countries candy did you start with? how did you chose what country would be next months box? do you backlog previous boxes for new customers or does everyone get the current month? how do you avoid sending repeat items to people?
i was a subscriber. the first box was dissapointing, the scandanavina one. then, it was isreal or something, the pretzels were the only thing worth mentioning. generally, the chocolate cookies come melted, holland's sure did. the mexico box was all treats i could get inside my gas station for 15 bucks or less. i thought the cards were very informational, and maybe my favorite part. i'm glad its working out for you all, but it needs something. not sure what it is. ( i think i had 4 boxes). how do you plan on improving?
how do you make it work? for example, let's say you pick albania for your next month. do you come here and buy the snacks or get in touch with a local person to select the snacks and ship samples to you?
what did you put your initial 2k into? did you have to take out any loans? i have a similar amount of money, i didn't really think starting a business would be possible with that amount, so i'm intrigued.
what are some examples of business mistakes you and your boyfriend made these past two years and how did you learn from them?
what do you do with the left overs snacks? i need more botan rice candy! :)
have you guys had to forfeit taking in salaries for the time being? and i'm also interested in why you moved? you guys should apply to be on shark tank. they would eat this up! i might suggest changing the name though to separate yourselves from other delivery meal plans.
are you anticipating a bump in sales as a result of this ama?
thanks for doing the ama, apologies if my question has been asked already. how did you go about testing product/market fit before launch? any particular customer validation tests you could point to that really made for a successful launch? cheers and best of luck.
there are about 20 alternative to your monthly subscription services that offer a variety of snacks. what makes your snacks/service different?
do you have auto scaling setup for your site? i noticed at 502 error. are you using something like cloudflare, aws, heroku? other?
what was your background before y'all went into this? how has it helped the company grow?
any plans on shipping outside of usa, canada, israel and england?
hey! i ordered a few months of your products for my sister's birthday last year to the uk. was really impressed by your service, and everyone i've talked about it with agrees it's such a cool idea, am glad that you are doing as well as you are. any chance of a branch opening this side of the pond?andmighttherebeajobinit?
congratulations on your success and all the best in the future! with the food businesses, i find the risk of someone getting sick or dying after eating the food being sold, scares me the most. i understand that you are in the business of selling a third party's product. what kind of quality controls do you have in place to mitigate this risk? to date, have you encountered an incident of this nature?
how are you handling the complex legalities where you might be infringing on a multi-national corporation's territory? what about the normal issues and costs associated with importing food product?
where does an aspiring business owner go to learn how to handle taxes and other legal parts? i've had a few things i've wanted to pursue but the real technical/legal parts are where i struggle comprehending where to start.
my boyfriend was on reddit one night about 3 weeks after our website launched and posted on r/shutupandtakemymoney. we didn't think much about it and went to bed. when we woke up, we had 24 new orders. we freaked out. this was more orders than we had gotten since launching. that whole day, orders just kept pouring in. i think we got 200 or so just from reddit. that day (specifically waking up that morning) was definitely the moment.
my favorite box was france, and my boyfriend's was south korea. my favorite snack was the haitai walnut chewy candies from south korea, and my boyfriend's favorite was lychee hi-chew from taiwan/japan (japanese company, made in taiwan).
learn how to do everything yourself, unless you absolutely cannot. we outsourced almost nothing, and in addition to saving us money it allowed us to make better decisions about how to outsource it later.
thank you! the process of figuring out what goes in the box has evolved a ton since we first started. here are all of the ways we do it: * we go to trade shows where manufacturers and importers come to exhibit their products. we make contacts, try products and get samples here. * we visit a lot of grocery stores in ethnic neighborhoods. we live just outside of nyc so we can almost always find a neighborhood with an ethnic grocery. * we make contacts with a lot of manufacturers/exporters/importers. sometimes this comes about through googling, sometimes through people, sometimes by finding their product as a sample in a store. these contacts are often experts and can help us find even more products. as you can imagine this takes a ton of time and effort. it takes the most time of anything in our business.
we send our customers snacks and candies from a different country each month. the snacks come with a 12-page booklet that has a ton of cool stuff like trivia about the country, descriptions of the snacks and their history, interesting pieces of culture, and a riddle to the next featured country! i write the card every month and it's one of my favorite parts of the job :)
it's a very difficult decision! while my boyfriend and i don't regret starting the business together, we both agree that we wouldn't want to start a business together again. it is very taxing on our relationship. our tipping point was when we were making enough money from the business to pay our bills. we focused on reducing our living expenses as much as possible. the business was growing so even though we were taking an initial pay cut, we were confident it would end up being a smart decision.
i've done it. i worked every evening and weekend for two years while maintaining the corporate job. we didn't have the business pay ourselves during that two years. we just reinvest back into the business. paid off all our personal debt, except mortgage. then once savings and cash flow was enough to pay ourselves, that's when i quit. wife is a stay at home mom with a 2 yr old and i run the business from home. stop agonizing. just do it. motivation will come later once you get the ball rolling.
in mt opinion, you will never "know". my parents and my brother have both opened they own businesses, so i consider myself to have a little know how on this topic. my parents opened a textile business in korea, became millionaires, sold it, came to the us, opened another business that ended up tanking and lost all their money. my brother opened a sort of networking business for less known designers/clothe manufacturers and after 5 years he is now a millionaire. each time they opened businesses, they weren't sure about anything. it created lots of tension, and frankly were probably the worst time periods of their lives. my best advice for you: if you do plan on starting a business, please please please research for a long time. after research, then decide whether or not you are ready to take the risk.
yes, the 7 digits is revenue. the business has been profitable since we started it. we are now able to take out enough money to live comfortably, and we invest everything back into the company. in terms of investing in the company, this is a mix of infrastructure and advertising. infrastructure being things like making our website better, buying equipment for our warehouse, etc. advertising to grow our customer base.
we both signed an operating agreement when we first started the business. it is owned 50 / 50 by me and my boyfriend. there have been many, many times when we've disagreed on a business decision. the best way we've found to handle it is to explicitly separate what the other person "owns". as an example, my boyfriend handles all of our operations, so he gets to make the ultimate call on anything that's related to our operations. after working together for two years, now i can definitely understand why it's discouraged to mix business and personal. however we also have shared a lot of great moments together and always have each other's back. he understands any sort of stress that i'm experiencing and overall, i would say it's made our relationship much stronger.
when the business first started, we paid a lot for the products, but our advantage was that we could keep our overhead super low. our rent in our first office space was $300 / month and we weren't paying ourselves at first. a storefront will never be able to start off with such a low overhead. as the business has grown, our overhead has grown, but we now often receive volume discounts on the products we purchase or we set up payment terms that allow us to receive a discount (ie. paying for the full order upfront).
yes you did, haha. we're trying to get it back up now but if not then sure, please try again tomorrow.
congratulations! we've had a lot of success marketing our product on youtube by partnering with content creators that have a good number of subscribers. we send them the box, they try the snacks on camera, sometimes we give them compensation beyond the free snacks depending on how big they are. we've experimented with fb ads but haven't had a huge amount of success with it. seo is important for every business, although we haven't spend a ton of time perfecting it (not a lot of people are searching for our product and stumble across it). what kind of product(s) are you selling? i can recommend some advertising channels once i know!
oh man, that's hard to remember. a lot of them were basic ideas - starting a store on etsy, going to garage sales and reselling stuff on ebay. i did have one idea that was similar to what we ended up doing... when i was in college, my friends and i would go to the grocery store and buy every brand of a product. like, we would buy 8 brands of peanut butter. then we would put them all in unmarked containers and do a taste test. we thought it was fun, and then we knew what to buy when we went to the store. i wanted to recreate this idea for people by sending them the samples in the mail in unmarked containers. we lost excitement for the idea when we realized that no one would pay for this - the real value was in getting the data back from people and selling it to stores or distributors or manufacturers. that just wasn't a route we were interested in pursuing.
we are very appreciative of tb. they just started making those videos - we never even talked to them about it. it obviously brought in new customers for us, and we are very grateful. also, i think the videos are pretty funny.
him and jenna have said they don't order them anymore because they could basically just order the stuff off amazon themselves. or have locals give them lists/ packages that would be more representative of the countries.
at a country a month, they have like 10 years before they need to think about that. i don't think anyone will mind getting two south korea boxes in the span of a decade
the first country we did was germany. we try to plan the countries so that we mix up regions of the world (e.g. an asian country, then european, then south american, etc.). we also do more asian and less european countries in the summer, because we can't ship chocolate. everyone gets the current month. we would like to eventually have all the boxes available all the time, but it really takes a lot of customers for this to work. you have to continuously source products from all over the world while keeping track of expiration dates so you don't send expired product. it's something to work toward, though! so far we've sent out boxes from 22 different countries. we've only repeated one country (we did brazil again for the olympics in august). obviously, we will eventually have to repeat some countries. when we do this we'll look for different products so that even though the country is the same, the products are new.
i've never thought to ask: what kinds of snacks are traditional in albania?
i'm not sure. we don't really consider ourselves in competition with anyone that's not internationally focused. our product is less about snacking and more about the experience of tasting something new and learning about other countries (in a fun way). among that market, there is much less competition.
haha, so many... we had a hard time transitioning from doing everything ourselves to outsourcing pieces of work. by extension, we also waited way too long to hire our first employee. we ended up feeling like were behind constantly because we didn't take anything off our plates. a lot of mistakes came from us being totally new to the industry (ecommerce and imported food). we didn't know how to communicate with suppliers, how to negotiate terms in contracts, etc. lots of small mistakes there.
yes. the fda does random inspections on all containers containing food products that come into the us. they also publish a list of banned ingredients, as well as packaging guidelines. in addition to ensuring we're not bringing in any products that contain banned ingredients, we also include a list of ingredients (in english) in the booklet we include in the box. that way, if all else fails you can at least ensure you're not eating something that you're allergic to.
i'm not sure, i've never done an ama before so i don't know what to expect. if you'd like, i'll be happy to report back in a few hours!
did that happen again after this ama? seriously considering subbing, and i know i'm not the only one after seeing this. i like these kinds of businesses and have a similar subscription to a japanese candy one. i totally love the idea that its a different country each month, that in itself was really neat and makes me want to sub.
ha, i remember that post! thanks for keeping my snack cabinet well stocked for the last two years. :)
hey, fellow entrepreneur here! i have a very similar story. when i officially launched my business/site, reddit alone brought in 10k in sales in a weekend. i literally quit my day job that monday. this was about 15 months ago. do you constantly feel like the bottom could give out at any time? like the whole thing could dry up because of no fault of yours and that would be that? dealing with that anxiety almost makes it not worth it sometimes.
you only had 24 orders in the first three weeks but you were already profitable? you must have very little overhead.
if you ever do a "best of" box, this would be my choices so far: 1. taiwan #1 - kuai kuai (strawberry flavoured cheetos!) 1. thailand - fashion food tomato cracker (unexpectedly good) 1. usa - teriyaki salmon jerky 1. poland - tapsy cheese & onion crisps 1. philppines - melon dew menthol candies 1. france - lutti magnificat caramels 1. uk - nestle caramac bar 1. south korea - haitai walnut soft candy 1. india - jelly amrood 1. japan - botan rice candy 1. mexico - bubu lubu worst snack so far: grape sujuk from turkey. its truly disgusting.
did you guys set times for work in your new business, after quitting your day jobs? or were you basically working it non stop whenever needed
you really need a german box soon! our bread snacks are great and only swiss people can make better chocolate
what are your top 5 favorite snacks? i saw bissli. i love bissli!
have you tried marketing to high schools and universities? edit for clarity: i am referring to the schools themselves not students. this would be great for a culture class or could be split between a larger high school or the department's at a university.
knowing you're from cincinnati, did jungle jims play a roll in you deciding this?
aren't there already like 20 other companies that are based around this same idea
i'm going to allow my so to start a business while i work my ass off to cover her. :)
may i ask what type of business you started? also, how did you not burn yourself out working so much while also having a new baby?
past business owner here. i'd suggest taking out a small percentage for personal savings as well as other investments. while you can easily net the most gain from investing everything back in the company, you really want to diversify if it goes down the tubes/takes a hit. also, if your relationship ever goes south you won't get locked into the idea you have to keep working together because literally everything is wrapped up in the company.
its great that the company is making money but profits that are invested back into the company isnt really comparable to salary. i think theyre wondering what you're personal take home pay is now compared to corporate jobs.
im selling fitness products aimed towards the more serious lifter. so weight lifting belts, straps, chalk, knee wraps etc. i know this is probably a little too niche, so i also decided to add athletic clothing, like muscle shirts, compression shirts, and yoga pants / workout tops for women. do you think this is doable? im quite new to this world, but was laid off from work due to the oil recession and really want to see if i can be successful and someday work for myself like you have done. once again thank you kindly for the reply :)
you put irish crisps (meanies) in the uk package. just saying...
there are like 4 or 5 countries we've done that actually have some of the products on amazon. most of the time the products we're featuring are not sold online. sometimes we're bringing the product into the us for the first time ever.
"this is bullshit! we already got snacks from trinidad 8 years ago!"
your website lists some of the past boxes but it misses the box that included german snacks. what was in the box?
being from cincinnati to travel to the land that created the "jersey slide" you have to cross into the world known as "cleveland" not many people make it out of this god forsaken place alive. so i can see why they speak of their survival.
reddit is a pretty great place to market since it's full of people with more money than sense.
considering the website is giving out 504 errors...
we have a ton of traffic on our website right now, but not a lot of orders. i'm sure we'll get more as things die down and the website regains functionality. i'm glad the idea is interesting to you! the japanese candy ones are cool, but i'm glad that we get to do a different country each month. it keeps things fresh as we're always learning about new places and working with new people.
thank you for your business and helping us get our start! what country has been your favorite?
i can totally understand and empathize with your feelings. since our product is subscription-based, it's unlikely that everyone will decide to cancel all at once. that said, finding new customers is hard and you never know which of your marketing efforts will pan out. for us, it's very nerve-wracking working with new suppliers every month to source our product. we don't have a preexisting relationship so there's no trust, and we're constantly afraid someone will screw us and the product won't come.
compiling snacks into boxes in their apartment? yes i imagine the overhead is low...
if they were doing it by themselves in their house, then yeah, very little overhead.
if you have no employees, no rent for office space, and can work on your own business without taking a wage, i imagine it wouldn't be that hard to "break even"
bissli is awesome! my top 5: * haitai chewy walnut candy from south korea * lychee hi chew from taiwan/japan * bamba (puffed corn with peanut flavoring) with hazelnut filling from israel * chocolate covered crepes from france * torcida pimenta mexicana (spicy chip-type things) from brazil
both groups of people who notoriously don't have any money.
yes!! those cheesy fund raisers are so terrible. this would be much cooler to buy. example: for every subscription that lasts 3 months the school gets 10 bucks. i teach and i could easily see the school raising a few thousand. people would crush these subscriptions if they could choose their countries as a 3-mo package. example i want italy month one, russia month two, and china month three. i would pay a student 36 bucks or whatever that would cost especially when 10 bucks could go to the school. maybe my numbers are off for your profits, but sounds pretty good for the schools. basically, i'm tired of my school selling stupid coupon books!
my guess is that its not that they don't have the exact number but that they can't (or won't) share it
my guess is that they know this number in detail and simply don't want to provide that information to the public. and at the same time they don't want to piss on their ama by not responding. my guess is they're more shrewd than you give credit for. particularly given their front page post.
"while i can't provide the exact number" probably means that they won't hand out that sort of information voluntarily, not that they don't know.
if that's the case, they are just proving that the demand for this product outweighs the supply. there can be more than a few companies. you don't pass a gas station and state "there are like thousands of gas stations out there."
when we launched our business, we were the first company to do a subscription box featuring snacks from a different country each month. since then, we've had a couple businesses come up that copied our idea. our mentality is to keep making the product better (through things like the booklet) to differentiate ourselves. we also want to be the best at sourcing unique, cool products that no one else has.
considering they are apparently a 7 figure company now, it's probably ok.
merkin of the month club? wonder how well that'd do
and it's probably pretty smart. if your customer does well then you will also do well.
that's a great way to do it! we thought about having one of us continue working full-time while the other took the leap. in the end, we decided it would build resentment as we both really wanted to work on the business.
this is great advice. we'll be looking at taking out a "bonus" at the end of this year to invest personally.
yep. if you're in canada you can pay yourself a dividend or call it a loan from your company and defer taxes. definitely take something out of it.
my first suggestion would be to create your own brand and try to sell as many branded products as you can. this is very important in this day and age. even if you can't afford to get your logo onto everything you're selling, start by using stickers. in terms of advertising - you should teach yourself a lot about google adwords. people search for what you're selling, and if you can find the right terms you can make good money selling to them. also, to get started you'll want to find bloggers/youtubers/instagrammers/etc. in the fitness niche. ask them to review your product in exchange for giving them the product for free. the smaller accounts will do it.
nothing redditors love more than an underdog story as well, "were a young couple that quit our job to pursue our dream selling ____" gets redditor dicks hard. pretty much every start up hotsauce/homemade soap company used reddit pity to gain initial financial support.
i think they might be overloaded from this thread
i bet this is one of the parts that's 'taxing on their relationship.'
i subscribe to a subscription box and actually the bottom did drop out for this company when they announced they would be charging for postage. well there was a huge backlash and people were not happy. prior to that we were paying $5 a month for a box, but then they had to add an extra $12 per month on top of that. i obviously don't know what went behind the scenes but they closed their facebook page, many apologies emails were sent out, then a survey on options that would satisfy us (ie. one bigger box four times a year instead of once a month), then everything went quiet for a few months, and finally an announcement that they had sold their business and the boxes would resume soon.
i always used to tell my wife that we could be working for someone and get fired or they could shutdown. there are no more guarantees in the corporate world. our 7 figure business did die, we got slaughtered by corporations that don't play fair and have no moral conscience. life moved on and i am back at a desk job.
sourcing and shipping packets of sweets from other countries, in bulk enough to not run out of stock.
my grand father grew out till he employed over 50 people. but he did start with it in his kitchen as well. same for our family company. selling pools from our living room.
any recommendations for belgium snacks? it's on our to-do list. we have maybe 6 products that we are aware of that we'd like to include. we especially need help with some savory snacks (like chips).
there's a theory that israeli kids are less prone to peanut allergies thanks to bamba being introduced early on. i have no idea how true it is but we gave it to our baby daughter and she loved it.
once you go hi chew you never go back to american chew candies. we can't get enough of them... but be careful of the mango (it smells like cat urine when you chew it, but still tastes great!).
they don't have as much money, but it's all disposable income...
i'd speculate the opposite. most businesses without mature systems and processes don't have realistic methods for tracking this sort of analysis.
yeah, there's like dozens of men's clothing, dog toy, makeup, etc. services. don't know why people would be expecting only one of a kind to exist, this being a competitive capitalist society after all
but you don't read about some guy doing an ama about opening a gas station
lol i laughed at the sentence 'we were the first company to do a subscription box featuring snacks from a different country each month.'. this type of bussiness has been done before even years ago. i mean its okay that we have more of them but don't pretend you guys came up with the idea or where even the first. thats a bit of bad advertisement if you are already lying to potential customers. maybe you need a better strategic plan.
funny, but expressively in terms of allow. allowing doesn't imply owning the person's action. there are things i have to have her allow me to do because i care for her opinion on the choices i make.
what we did was a quarterly financial review. while we didn't pull money out every quarter, we tried to pull out something. it was a low as $400 one time and as high as 20k just to keep it consistent. consistency is the key, small or large.
people get pissed if you tell them that though ..im a business owner in canada who takes full advantage of these weirdo tax laws we have and ways to pay ..but when you tell other businesses owners you barely paid any taxes on 500k+ they get kinda pissed and pull out the pitch fork canadian tax laws are odd ..cra is odd ..it's just an odd system
wow. this made me realize that about half of my subscribers on my youtube channel have come from reddit after i talked about how depressed i was before starting my channel. i kinda expected to get ignored but i actually got a lot of really friendly pms asking to see my channel to support me. it was kinda heartwarming.
imaging a hosting company as part of a relationship: "godaddy, we should talk. i think we have grown apart and don't think this is going to work out" *"its that slut isn't it!! rackspace with her "enthusiastic" customer service. "* "it's not you it's just my needs have changed and ..." *"is it cause their sla better then mine?"*
you can just go to an international market, no reason to import anything. these boxes are never cheaper than just getting the things yourself, you're just paying to not have to go out yourself
doesn't aws have a great small business offering that can scale accordingly? i know they obviously do this for big business but i thought i read about then being great for small businesses too.
not really. many college students have bills to pay and high school kids tend to have very very little money, so little that they would not spend it on a subscription.
disagree - or at least, if they're into any of the growthhack/startup culture and read any of the blogs (which i'm pretty sure they do, considering they started an online start-up) they'll know to track retention, churn, customer lifetime value, etc.
competition makes all products and services better, more efficient, and less expensive. if you think you can do something better than what's out there, then go ahead start something.
making the assumption that this encouraging allowance is more financial than affectionate
how is that consistency? you consistently did the review but those amounts are anything but consistent. was it a consistent fraction of profits? consistent
they can get pissed all they want. are they covering the responsibility for your retirement income? are they paying for your vacation? are they working 100 hour weeks so you don't have to lay everyone off? no? then they can shut the fuck up.
guide to being a self-made internet startup millionaire "hey reddit, my wife and i just quit our jobs to pursue our dream of starting a homemade hot sauce scented soap monthly gift box. it's been the only thing helping with my depression and my newly wed wife's cancer"
i mean while i don't have one of these boxes, the appeal for me is that if i were to just go out and buy things myself i would probably end up with the same things i always get. using these boxes i can try things i never would have tried on my own.
exactly the reason it's so hard to start a business. it's just really difficult to imagine how easily a fool and his money are parted.
yeah, but scaling can be really expensive. aws can handle reddit frontpage load with no problem, but this traffic is going to die down, and they probably won't see another surge like this for a while. for a super small business, sometimes it is better to ride out the outage rather than pay $$$ for extra servers, which might nullify any profit from the sales that would be lost.
you're correct. i would always ask her about buying something crazy and outrageous and she'll shoot me down. :p
i went back to see if he meant consistent with quarterly withdrawals, no matter how small/large it was. then realized he said they didn't pull money out every quarter. do as i say, not as i do?
1) nobody calls it that. (he edited it from timmy-ho's) 2) i'd rather starve.
i can vouch for this combination, used it in a previous job and it's simple, flexible, and works well.
you're right, but it's also interesting. i'm far more interested in being marketed to this way, with interaction, rather than traditional methods.
i'm assuming they would only take this out of the profit.
did playing a man so badly bullied by his co-workers have an effect on you irl? also, your dog is awesome.
hi jim! you sat in front of my friend and i at a performance of hedwig and the angry inch on broadway about two years ago. not only were you kind enough to introduce yourself and my friend and i stared at you in awe, but you took the time to take a picture with us when the show was over since we weren't allowed to take them in the theater. you were so kind and willing to talk to two awkward 18 year olds so i just wanted to thank you, two years later! my question is: what's your favorite encounter you've had with a fan?
hey jim gengurch! i love your acting in many shows i've seen, especially p&r. the finale after special refers to you being the most different from your character. which other actors are most distant from their characters and most similar?! also, how much do you miss p&r?!
hey tim, you've kind of been defined by your role on *parks & rec*, but you've had a long and impressive career. is there one movie or tv show you've been in -- other than *middle man* -- that you'd recommend to people looking to see a little more of you? a performance you're particularly proud of?
hi jim! at one point in p&r, it is referenced that your character has a very large penis. does that take any method acting on your part?
hi!! who was the funniest cast member on parks and rec and who was the most fun to work with? also how similar is nick offerman to ron swanson? (in my head they're the same person) thanks!!
hi jim! jerry/kerry/larry/terry/gary gengurch was one of my favorite characters. i can relate to being the clumsy one who's always the butt of the jokes. you never failed to make me smile while portraying him. what are your dog's names, and can you tell me a bit about them?
tim, with this being described as a "black comedy", how was this role different for you in comparison to past roles, and how do you feel audiences will react?
was it difficult playing such a wholesome and naive character, when a lot of your other work is so dark and twisted? it's great you have such a wide range.
have you been able to keep any interesting props or memorabilia from any of your roles?
first aubrey played a character named lenny in 'legion' and now you're playing lenny in 'middle man'. who do you think the next one from parks and recreation to play a lenny...? personally, i'm hoping it is li'l sebastian.
hey jim! big fan of your work, my dad was actually one of the people that invested enough to be an extra in middle man so we are super excited to see it in theatres! my question to you is, who has been your all time favorite actor/actress to work with? thanks so much!
was the cast of parks and rec overly nice to you off camera to make up for how jerry was treated on camera?
who was your favourite director and actor that you've worked with?
how often do you pull a classic jerry move? also: i remember seeing you in a castle episode, and i swear it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen, as i decided that your character (who was a butcher with anger management issues, if i recall correctly) was jerry gergich trying to process everything he was put through in parks and rec.
would you rather fight 100 aziz-sized li'l sebastians or 1 li'l sebastian-sized aziz? credit to /u/goddamnnamedoesnotfi for the tweak to my original question
hi jim! if you could be anything other than an actor, what would you be?
was the makeout-fest on late night planned between you and aubrey or just improvisation?
hi jim! so chris pratt's kardashian cumback joke has basically become legendary. were there any other funny moments like that one that didn't make the blooper reel?
hey larry, what did you type into altavista to get here?
ask you anything, eh? okay. let's put this question to bed: is the reason that gayle was with jerry/terry/larry/etc., was because of his massive penis? according to dr. harris (whom chris traeger said was literally the meanest person he's ever met), it's the biggest penis he's ever seen. i mean, he didn't even know if you had mumps. he forgot to look. he was distracted. by the largest penis. he had ever seen.
we know of your enormous member thanks to your pandr checkup, but what i really want to know is did you have mumps?
hi jim. altoids or tic-tacs that night on seth meyers?
hi jim, i just want to say that i love your acting, you're extremely funny. the scene when chris is proposing to ann while larry is choking in the back is one of my favorites of the show! congratulations on the emmy! my question is, was there any jerry in the parks and rec crew?
hey jim, i can't wait to see your new movie, but i'm afraid i have to ask, do you ever see the parks and rec gang reuniting in the future? maybe for a reboot or even a film? would love to see you all back one last time.
i loved you on the show! who was your best bud on set?
hi jim! are you a billy joel fan? you were married to his ex wife! also, murinal! lol
hi jim! thank you for taking the time to answer some questions. how do you think your character lenny and jerry/terry/larry would get along? if you chose a boys day out for them where would you go?
who would win in a mud wrestling match, nick offerman, or chris pratt?
hi jim! has dj roomba come back to haunt you with black eyed peas yet?
hello mr. o' heir, i am a big fan of your work. you captured the essence of the nice guy who seems to finish last almost perfectly. i just have to ask, how did you discover the character of jerry within yourself? he reminds me a lot of myself growing up. i was always helping with stuff but was never acknowledged for it so thank you for embodying that role so well.
off the top of your head, what was the funniest parks and rec scene you participated in shooting?
hi jim! do you and chris pratt keep in touch? do you keep in touch with the other p&r cast members?
my sister is a theater teacher for a middle school and we are both huge fans of your role as jerry in pnr. any advice for her class that are about to go into high school theater?
which actor/actress on parks and rec was most similar to their character?
hi jim! what was your favorite and least favorite episodes to shoot of parks and rec?
what was it like working with michael schur? is he as comedically inclined as we all believe, or is it just the great casts he has worked with that should take credit?
hey jim. i love your doggos! what are their favorite things to do?
i was watching rosanne and was delighted to see you in a random episode. do have a any cool memories form back then on set and what do you think about the reboot?
what was your favorite "gerry-burn"? mine was - i know it's kind of basic - the fart attack.
i loved jerry (terry, gerry) on parks and rec. we're there any jokes you made in the outtakes that you wished they used and what were they?
are you and aubrey still a thing? who was your favorite guest star on parcs?
do you have any thoughts on the passing on parks and rec guest star, glenne headly?
thanks for taking your time tim! what do you think about the shows final season?
yes. my dog is awesome!!! ;) as far as being bullied on the show having an effect on my real life i would say no. the bullying was only on camera. the minute the director yelled cut i was definitely one of the "in crowd". lol
i love that we eventually find out that he has a beautiful family and has achieved awesome life goals !
his name is lord shelton. and his rectum is fine.
i remember meeting you at hedwig (great show by the way). because of the popularity of p&r it's changed many things in my life. 99% good...1% not so good. i can honestly say that part of the 99% is the interaction i have with the fans. i know a lot of actors aren't happy to stop and talk with their fans but i'm always happy to take pics and chat a little. there were many many years as a working actor that nobody knew who the hell i was. the fact that i was lucky enough to land a show like parks and get to have an impact on peoples lives is something i will never take for granted. i'm honored (and humbled) that people like my work and want to come up to let me know. for those wondering what the 1% is that isn't so great...people sneaking pictures. i would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it. for some reason that seems much more invasive to me. :)
missing p&r is something i will do the rest of my life. i spent six years (7 seasons) with the greatest cast and crew that has ever been assembled (in my humble opinion). thankfully the cast are constantly texting each other and staying in touch. i keep in touch with a lot of the crew too. that being said...nothing will ever be like going to work every day to laugh with people you truly loved. as far as people being different from their characters...as actors i think we all bring a certain part of ourselves to every role. it's just natural. nick offerman is a smart man who can build anything. so that's like ron. on the other hand i think politically they might be at odds.
great question. i've been blessed to have been working in this crazy business for over twenty years. because of the popularity of parks i'll always be best known as jerry which is a gift. i love when i get to sink my teeth into a dramatic role. dark comedies are my favorites. it's one of the things that led me to middle man. i'm not the "funny" guy in the film yet i get a lot of laughs. i love getting a new script and figuring out what i'm going to do with it. as far as finding something i did in the past...hmmm...i did an episode of diagnosis murder where i got to play a crazed serial killer. i had a lot of fun with that. i would also check out a remake of harvey i did many years ago with leslie nielsen, swoosie kurtz and harry anderson. it was one of my first films. i look like a baby. it was an amazing experience. :)
well geez why can't he say his new role? it's what brought him here in the first place.
i think the "mugging" was a pretty bad day for jerry. he knew that if they found out what really happened (dropped a burrito in the creek) that he would take hell for days. i love how he came up with the mugging story. to think that he thought he could get away with it kills me. :)
i love playing a jerry type character. i'm sure it will be something i'll do forever. the problem in hollywood is that they can easily put you in a certain box. typecasting like you mentioned. it's just the nature of the biz. the gift of middle man is that i get to step out of that box and really dig into a deeply disturbed character. :)
nick offerman is actually super liberal, whereas ron swanson is super not.
i was listening to an interview with him and ron was based off nick but everything is greatly exaggerated.
thanks so much. my dogs names are chase (the white one) and stella (the black one). they're both rescues. last year i lost both of my other dogs to cancer. i don't have kids so the dogs become like children (some people think that's crazy...that's ok). when they passed away i didn't think i could ever go through it again. after nine months my gut was telling me that it was time again. i went to the linda blair world heart foundation and found chase. i knew within two minutes of meeting him that he needed to be with me for the rest of his life. a few months later i went to the amanda foundation and met stella. she had obviously been abused and needed some loving. they're brought the smile back to my face after losing my other two pups. :)
it's totally different than any other role i've played. my character lenny starts out in the same vein as jerry from parks. a sweet, nice guy. unfortunately for lenny he makes one terrible mistake and on his way to las vegas he picks up a hitch hiker (played by andrew j. west). this turns his life upside down. from that moment on we slowly watch the mental unravelling of an otherwise normal dude. playing the character was terrifying because if i didn't make it work the film doesn't work. from what i hear i did it justice. :)
you nailed it. li'l sebastian will be starring as lenny in "of mice and men". can't wait to see it. :)
nick offerman as lenny in "of mice and men" would be interesting
this is definitely the most important question i will answer today. the answer is rob lowe. i only say that because he has his own fragrance line and it would make sense that he smells better than the rest of us. :)
my favorite director was a guy who started as our editor on parks. he had also worked on the office. his name is dean holland. he really understood all of our characters and knew how to get the best out of us. my favorite actor that i've worked with is too broad of a question. i've fallen in love with so many people i've worked with over the years. by "love" i mean i loved being around them. :)
i typed "please bring me to a site on the interwebs called reddit that will let me answer questions". ;)
i've never been able to see if i have mumps. when i go to look i'm always distracted by the largest penis i have ever seen. ;)
i'm obviously not him but i think the show ended perfectly. i don't know if they can top that ending.
my best bud was retta (donna). our trailers were back to back so we spent a lot of time going between them. our characters were not initially brought on as series regulars so i think that bonded us right off the bat. we were both in limbo together while things were working themselves out. i had lunch with retta last week. she's one of my favs in life. :)
mr. o'heir? who the hell is that? lol great question. there's certainly a part of jerry in jim. at least i hope so. i think that jerry is a very kind and caring person. i would like to think that i have those attributes as well. unfortunately i don't have the temperament that jerry has. i can upset and people know it. jerry just seems to let it all roll off his shoulders. i've always been a kind of people pleaser. i'm not sure how healthy that is but it's who i am. i've gotten better as i've gotten older which makes me happy but ultimately it's in my core to try and make people feel comfortable...sometimes at my own expense. damn. i need therapy now! lol ;)
people always ask about regrets. i don't think they're very healthy and certainly aren't going to help us today. that being said...one of my regrets is not being involved in my high school theater department. when i was a kid you were labeled depending on what you did or who you hang out with. there were the burn outs, stoners, jocks, brains and a few others i'm probably forgetting. in my day if you were part of the theater crowd you were known as a drama fag. unfortunately i let that term stop me from doing something that i probably would have loved. words are powerful and when you're young you don't realize that it just doesn't matter. if i could go back to those days now knowing what i do i'd be happy to be called a drama fag. :) tell them to work hard and enjoy every minute. they will also make friendships that will last a lifetime. :)
the popular answer is going to be offerman but imo it's aubrey plaza.
i have soooo many favorite episode of parks. the one i like to always mention is the season 2 episode called "the hunting trip". i think it's one of my all time favs because it was the first time we were all out of the office together (other than april and andy) and you got to see who we were in that world. the scene where donna (the awesome retta) realizes her mercedes has been shot is one of my all time favorite scenes of the whole series. i also loved the harvest festival and the episode where ben and jerry had their day out together. ben had set up a special day for he and leslie but she wasn't available. he ended up doing everything with jerry. so damn funny. i can honestly tell you that there is no least favorite episode that we shot. not trying to avoid the question...there just wasn't. i have great memories of all of them. :)
you saw me in roseanne? that's awesome. unfortunately i've never been on that show. lol but seriously, i used to watch roseanne and would have loved to have been on it...but sadly no. you must have me confused with some other shockingly handsome well hung guy. ;) as far as the reboot goes...i'm not sure. some things are better left alone. :)
when the writers realized that jerry was going to be the office punching bag they also realized that they had to give him some reason not to blow his head off. lol they decided that ultimately jerry would have the best life of any one of the characters. jerry's wife and kids adored him and thought he did no wrong. don't forget...they also gave him a huge penis. i like when real life and tv life come together. ;)
also was great that when he was at home he was super witty, had great reflexes etc. honestly i've always considered that to be a master stroke of the show.
he also has the largest penis that doctor had ever seen.
i tweeted at him saying "shut up jerry" once and he responded saying "okay u/mrsp00pybutth0le :)" :') i still feel bad
sooo... when's the sequel coming? ann and chris in michigan? house of cards-esque drama with leslie and ben? full house with you and gail? please. i need this.
you and h jon benjamin should put out an album together then.
i loved your cameo in brooklyn 99 as the homophobic cop in florida.
i don't actually know if he has mumps, i didn't look.
that's pretty much it. nick is such a great guy and so is ron. they just took nick to an nth degree. what he did with that character was something i have never seen on another show. i've always been confused on why he never received an emmy for his work. :)
damn. should have read this before my previous comment. i guess nick and lil' sebastian are going to have to fight this one out. :)
not a lot, but it does get a lot of comments like "i had to downvote you because you don't like the same tv show i do."
from what i've read, aubrey asked jim during a break while taping if he wanted to do it during the song. i mean, who's going to say no to that anyway?
i love this because donna also showed jerry so much warmth on the show (in her own way). it makes me so happy that you're pals outside the show.
i figured the popular answer probably would've been chris pratt but i was kinda hoping it was aziz ansari
i completely agree. the episode where jerry retires and leslie comes over to talk with him because she felt like they didn't give him a good farewell was one of my favorites. leslie sees how jerry is adored by h is family. she also sees that he's awesome around his house. he's funny, smart, quick reflexes. leslie acts likes she's been thrown to some other dimension. the writers on parks always knew how to handle each situation. i thought it was a brilliant idea. :)
100% agree with you. the coffee-mug flip is one of my favorite scenes in the series.
was brilliant and maybe among the zenith period of the show
many people have told me that they work without someone who is basically the office punching bag. i seems that every office needs that person to take the fall for everything. unfortunately for jerry it was his burden to take on. that being said...i do believe that jerry truly loved all of his co-workers and knew that deep down they all had his back. as much as family was most important to jerry he also adored all the people he worked with. even when they weren't being especially kind.
i get the feeling they did this to make it up to the actor for all of the abuse he took. that and his hot wife. i always wondered how actors with characters like this can compartmentalize the experience of being verbally/psychologically abused. i mean, i know it isn't real but the writers are making fun of their physical representation of the character which is their actual physical appearance irl. i am guessing it is easier for adult actors but what about younger ones who are still developing psychologically? for example, anne from arrested development. there were some really cutting comments about her on that show and i have to assume it stung a bit.
i remember that tweet. sniff sniff lol all good!!!!! :)
i'm just now watching it and the surprise cameos are one of the best parts of the show. between mr. oheir and like every side character from its always sunny, its been amazing.
so, everyone agrees this is a tom quote without argument, right?
the part when you found out he has brothers blew me away.
dunno, we see a very different side of him on master of none, which i think is probably closer to him irl.
i once had a lyft driver who worked on parks & rec as a crew member. we asked him if any of the actors were secret jerks or anything like that. he said everyone was great, but the biggest difference was that aziz was much quieter and more reserved than his character.
he did not have favorable things to say from the show.
j-r was easily my favorite character on that show, and mona lisa was a close second. *i got run over by a lexussssss*
i remember watching a segment where the cast talked about how bad they felt about the constant bullying of jerry, because in real life they all love jim, so that's why they wrote him the perfect life outside of work. hot wife, loving family, all that. they also said jim probably the most twisted dude irl.
the absolute confusion on leslie's face. good times.
hey guys, i',m getting interested in rewatching. which season and episode we're talking about?
the relationship between ben and jerry (heh) was so awesome. i loved how ben was so much more conscious of how terrible jerry was treated by everyone, and then jerry noticed that ben noticed, and would stop ben from intervening and in a subtle way would let him know it's ok and he's used to it. such awesome chemistry between characters in that show.
i knew exactly what that was going to be before i even clicked. and, just like gail, i was not disappointed.
fuuuck. that played on blast at a subway i'm at. "that man has the largest penis i have ever seen"
i always figured it was because of his time share in muncey.
that's an interesting insight. yes. when they're making fun of a characters physical attributes they are also making fun of the actors in a way. personally i've never been bothered by it. i've been a big guy all my life so weight jokes come with the territory. that being said maybe i should get myself some therapy and figure some shit out. lol :)
or toby from the office. i know he's an adult, but he gets destroyed on an every episode basis. funny, but it's gotta take a toll on your psyche.
who other than artemis? i've only recently started watching it's always sunny so i have probably missed the connections !
this. guy. fucks. tell me about all the fucking you've been doing
what makes that so awesome is that i read somewhere (or maybe watched a video) where one of the writers said they were genuinely pissed at him because they couldn't have written a funnier line.
that's fair, master of none has been awesome so far and he seems super genuine in the role of dev.
did he quit or did the producers not ask him to return?
the showrunners also did not have favorable things to say about him. it says quite a bit that brendanaquitz is never mentioned again after he leaves, as if the writers are just erasing him from memory.
boom! two ankle bracelets. the judge said it's the first time he's ever had to do that. uh, ja boiz a question on the baaaaar exaaaaam~!
i'd like to start my day the gergich way. now give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
that plus ben's near obsession with how he was married to his wife were just perfect.
by the later seasons ben was essentially a permenant break in the fourth wall. he was an extension of the viewer, reacting how a normal person would to all the ludicrous behavior. and i loved that.
there was only ever one possibility. and yet, it's always worth the rewatch.
yes. a time share in muncie can certainly sway a girls head. but jerry's other "head" is what probably turned her head. lol
i'm understanding now why everyone on the cast of parks and recreation has always had such wonderful things to say about you. you have a wicked sense of humour and such a positive outlook.
well toby was one of the writers and later the showrunner, so you'd have to think he was ok with doing it to himself.
they also had anne and andy. like raggedy anne and andy.
add to that ben's "coming out" about liking larry. the way the show made such a seemingly simple situation sooo strained and controversial was art.
damn, jerry. never knew you had all these dirty jokes in you.
from what i've read, they planned on her being played by a different actress every episode to show how unmemorable she was. but they decided that the audience wouldn't get it, and dropped the idea.
actually, paul lieberstein disliked being on camera, so toby usually had very few lines in the episodes he wrote. i think mindy kaling is responsible for a lot of toby's shining moments.
really? i didn't know that. til. i suppose that would make it a lot easier to handle it. i was under the impression it was all bj novak. hmmm.. learn something new every day.
everyone who worked in the annex early on, not in the last season, was a writer. it let them not need to be on screen at all times but still in the show!
he also said he used to look like iirc chris before he married gayle in one episode. dude was a catch.
i knew they were all writers, but i never put together why it made sense they were all together. no idea how i didn't put that together. thanks!
how is the adpocalypse affecting you and the broader tech youtube community?
hi linus! how much shit do you get for your footwear choice?
so linus, what video do you hate the most on all of your channels? and why?
hey linus, any plans to bring back kickfarted? working off that, are there any other "series" that you plan on continuing (like the workshop?) i love your content across all three channels, keep it up!
hey linus, what's probably the most exciting project that you've done on the channel (ltt)?
hi linus, was it a conscious decision to remove the part at the end of scrapyard wars when the teams share the specs of their builds and the prices of everything? if so, why did you make that decision? the reactions from the teams over what parts everyone found have been one of my favorite things to see. i believe much of the community agrees that we want to see that part on season 6, even if it is included as some sort of like director's cut, specials, or whatever you want to get another video out.
linus, did the "walking in the rain" video have the effect you wanted? just curious as it's quite out of character from the rest of your content.
hi linus, can we get a updated ofice tour youtube video?
hey linus! thanks for doing the ama :) what kind of video would you like to make which you still have not had the chance to make, because you lack resources or something related to the idea?
what's the most expensive thing you have ever broken?
any recommendations for best cable management practices? zipties? velcroes? twine?
linus, you helped me build my first computer while you were at ncix so thanks for that! do you ever regret making a company with your name in it? do you ever get grief for that from coworkers or random fans?
hey linus, where do you and the team see the company and the channel in the next few years, especially with all of youtube's recent and coming policy changes?
hey linus, i'm a long time fan! i've got your noctua fans in my system and i'm a floatplane pilot. it's been mesmerising seeing you jump from height to height, going from ncix to where you are today and it's truly inspiring. my question to you is, how do you unwind and relax at the end of the day after working so hard for so long?
how often do you work with other tech youtubers like kyle jay, paul, and them? is it more a business relationship or do you all text and talk often?
is luke getting his own space for floatplane club, and how separated is he going to be from the rest of the crew?
will ltx become a regular yearly thing? (please? :d)
what upcoming product are you and the team most excited to get a review sample on?
i'm curious if the upgrade to red equipment seemed "worth it" to you? in the end you dropped big bucks on not only the (imo) extremely overpriced red cameras and their required accessories, but also a huge new storage server to hold the footage, and new editing workstations to be able to edit the footage more easily. it seems like a pretty massive upgrade when your quality was already very solid.
@edzel: do you prefer final cut or premier? @brandon: what is your favorite camera that you personally own? @luke: thoughts about e3 so far? @linus: what has been your favorite video that you've hosted?
do you prefer to film scripted videos or do you like the more "freestyle" videos like random unboxings? personally i love the crazy unscripted videos, or videos like about you almost loosing all your data. those make ltt for me!
how do you balance your personal time with your wife and kid against work time?
given unlimited budget, what would be a video that you would like to shoot? most interested in answers from linus and brandon.
hi linus, how much of your time actually goes into making content nowadays, compared to how much of it is needed for managing the business?
good afternoon to all at lmg, i was wondering how hard it was for you guys to develop into what you've become? how did you build the reputation you have across youtube and the computing world as an important group, and how do you deal with things like hiring new people? i imagine that a large number of people want to get in for fame and recognition, how do you deal with that vetting process?
hey luke, are you still trying to switch to linux? i'm still using windows for gaming on my main pc, but switched to ubuntu (and now to arch) on my laptop. it's a great experience, especially for programming
hi linus, would you ever take your ear piercings out/get any more?
is there something that you have always wanted to do on youtube (maybe as a fun challenge) but didn't really fit on any of your channels so you decided against it?
this question is for luke specifically. do you still regret not using flowers for scrapyard wars? :3
how much will the videos be delayed because of this ama?
hey linus, what's with the nails in some of your videos?
hi linus, how do you deal with people outside of the youtube community when trying to explain what you do for a living? you've made great strides in creating your own company, was it ever difficult trying to get loans or other business backing (outside of the tech industry like when you got the warehouse) with such a unique company? also, what do you tell your kids your job is? any ideas on what awesome build to bring for your first "parent show and tell" event in a few years? ;p
hi linus. did you feel the growth in linus tech tips as it got on and on or was more of a "holy crap we're bigger than i thought" kind off a thing?
what's one piece of tech that you'd love to see come back or updated, and one piece of tech that just needs to stop?
what's happening to the old workstations now that you've upgraded to x99? are they just being thrown out, or will there be some kind of giveaway?
do you watch other youtube channels? what are some of your favorite ones?
hey luke! are you still planning to finish your engineering studies?
with the talk about luke moving into new offices for fpc, is fpc growing much faster than expected? and will the two branches of lmg remain in separate locations or is it just temporary? i don't want luke to leave, i like watching the whole crew and wan show with him in :(
hey guys! are you ever going to do another pc build in mineral oil? the last one was very captivating to watch.
any chance for a follow up video on linus' civic? perhaps rgb lighting :)
hi lmg, i have two questions. 1: what are some of the perks of working in such close proximity with the ceo of the company? 2: when new members are added does everyone get less work or the same amount ?
oh man... is there any reason not to make content "linux" related? it would be such a good thing if you could just check how linux works out of the box in all those laptops you review... and thank you for such an amazing channel!!!
how different is working at lmg for you original members nowadays with more people? do you miss the old days with only a handful working together?
what's the most gut-wrenching moment you guys have ever experienced when building a computer? commercially or personally. i'll never forget spending every last penny i had saved for months on a 2nd hand gtx 670, only to plug it in and have no response. thankfully it was the psu, but after a couple restarts my heart still sank.
linus, have you ever watched mr. robot? what is your opinion about it?
hey there linus, why do look so depressed taking that picture for the ama?
what is the future for ltt? do you guys collectively or individually have any ideas for new shows, ideas or challenges? how does floatplane tie into it? thanks!
do you want your kids to be tech savvy as you are or just let them be what they wanna be?? he was team red the way he chose all the red colored parts when building a pc with you lol
why does ltt base everything on "how good is this for gaming"?
what is your end game for ltt/lmg? will you start a pc web-store similar to ncix/newegg/etc..?
kyle from bitwit is using youtube premium to achieve early release videos to subscribers. why not use that format instead of re-inventing the wheel with fpc?
hi linus, i love your channel and watch it basically every day, how do you find the creativity to come up with a new video every day?
luke, ed, and brandon: is how much creative freedom do you guys get? or put another way, are the channels "the linus show with supporting characters" or is there feedback from most of you guys as to what you want to do? second question, whos idea was the $130k+ worth of red weapon gear (not including petabyte project)? was linus really that shocked when he read the pricing invoice?
any camera related videos in the pipeline? haven't seen brandon in the spotlight recently
hi linus, what is the current state of float plane club and how close do you think you are before other channels start to use your platform?
since our videos are advertiser friendly, it hasn't hit us too hard directly.. but it was part of what prompted us to build floatplane club so that we and other creators would have ways to make money in the event that our adsense revenue got ripped away.. so it's definitely costing us money, but only because we're re-investing what we're making.
i've actually exchanged emails with them already and i have a call with some folks over there sometime this week to discuss my concerns. there was a lot of concern from members of our community that our criticism of intel would negatively affect our relationship with them or our business moving forward.. but i think that's not giving intel enough credit. they are big girls and boys and can absolutely take the constructive criticism with the praise. and in response to the folks who didn't understand why our workstations are using intel after that video.. even if i don't agree with their strategy, i respect that they build world class technology and i'm not going to stop recommending their products just because we're having a bit of a spat at the moment.
firetruck unboxing video. i wouldn't even hate it so much if it didn't have more views than all of the good stuff i've ever done. if it didn't make so much money in adsense from 5 year olds just watching "the next suggested video about firetrucks" i'd pull it down. it's an embarrassment.
i personally really like kickfarted but not every kickstarter product we order is spectacularly bad enough to feature in the series, but we will probably revisit it.
it's a matter of time. we've actually reached out to the brand that makes the sandals i wear about doing an ltt edition sandal. they got back to us saying it "didn't align with their brand values" or something to that effect. i was like "what?? the only person on earth who proudly rocks your dad sandals as a keystone of his image and supporting that is not part of your brand values?? what are your brand values??"
7 gamers 1 cpu was one of the most exciting projects i've done. i'll always remember the moment it worked as one of the highlights of my career. that's really where i get off - spending a ton of time on something, not being sure that it's going to work, and then seeing the end result be awesome. scrapyard wars season 1 will also hold a special place in my heart forever. that was where we began experimenting with the idea of being a "tech top gear" rather than just a review channel and that path we took continues to shape our content (even our reviews which contain more personalities and funny stuff and more little sketches than ever) to this day.
this. i found it really jarring in the final episode of the last season where you had the team talking about finishing their benchmarks and then instantly it changes frames completley and jay is starting to review them. then after about 5mins the winner was decided and it was over. seems a real shame to have this 3hour or so build up, only to have the big reveal over in about 10mins.
for the most part, i didn't think it was interesting enough to work through that section of the footage with the time i had to do it in. it was very unstructured and, again, imo, not interesting enough. maybe that could be something i throw out there as like an fpc thing. it's also something that i'll probably have playing at ltx.
we might show some of this footage at ltx, but it was very unstructured/kinda boring
yeah dennis and i were both really pleased with it.
probably at some point and so much has changed so there is a lot to show :)
he wants to make this stupid nonsensical movie that is just actually dumb. this was an idea he had 5 years ago and he still wants to do it. super cheese fest with stupid techy nerdy junk.
i think berkel holds the record for most expensive stuff broken... he got out of his chair, which caused the air shock to spring up, knocking over a 34" lg ultrawide back when they were brand new (about $1500us iirc). i was also (somewhat) responsible for taking our sony fs700 out for a shoot in the rain (brandon let me do it, so it's partly on him). it didn't work for a few days and we had to disassemble it to the greatest degree we could to dry it out.. scary times. that was in the early days when we couldn't have afforded to replace it :p
reading positive, supportive comments like this one. i also love spending time reading stories to my kids and playing with them and playing badminton.
being up in western canada makes collaboration a little tougher.. and i'm pretty asocial by nature so i haven't generally gone out of my way to "collab" - especially because many collabs are just blatant subscriber swaps "hey sub to me and sub to him/her and get a chance to win" but i've also known a lot of the people in the tech tuber scene for years and really enjoy spending time with them. so it's nice to have an excuse to hang out and make a video. i'm not like sending them dick pics on snapchat or whatever though.
eventually, and completely. it will be it's own building.
depends how the first one goes. if we lose buckets of money, then no. if we lose a little bit of money, then probably. if we break even or make money, then game on!
we will be making a video about that very soon :p
i prefer 'guided' where you have an arc planned out and you have the meat of what you want to say written but it's not word for word
i prefer scripted only because i don't have the same talent for free styling that luke and linus do
i suck at it :p but seriously, i have no social life, so it's just work/family, which makes it a bit easier. i get one night a week to go out and play badminton and other than that i go home and spend time wiht the kids. i've also significantly cut back on the time i spend working on the weekends. so it's not too bad at this point.
i think i've taken over most of the day-to-day tasks with regard to production/management of the children. at one point linus told me that with me doing that stuff, writers writing stuff, he didn't really have much to do some days.
for most of us at the start, it took a lot of hours, low pay (so linus could afford to keep us going), and corner cutting. actually, it sounds like not much has changed. nevermind. for my hire so far, and the people i hire in the future, i don't really hold chasing fame against them. motivation is motivation.
i am, i've been very busy with other projects and there are a lot of windows only apps that i need so i will likely be splitting my system in half with unraid.
i don't regret making the video where we simulated ryzen 5 performance, but i regret titling it in a deceptive manner.. other than that the only video i've ever actually taken down was a detailed tour of my house. i was trying to show the reception issues with some early asus tablet and had inadvertently shown a lot of personal details that didn't belong on the internet. i'm also still not sure how i feel about some of the videos that feature my kids. they love making videos with daddy (especially my son) and they only appear once in a while so i don't think i'm going to be destroying their lives or anything, but they're also too young to really understand what it means to be on the internet, so i don't know how they'll feel about that down the line.
it's gotta be the liquid cooled room, haha. so much work and effort, riddled with issues along the way, and it didn't even end up making a significant difference.
no. i am seriously considering going to school part time for project management however.
i think we'll start doing linux content when the year of linux comes around. any minute now...
one of the reasons the community respects and trusts ltt: you are not afraid to call out companies regardless of your relationship with them.
estimated earnings for the firetruck video is 12 grand. i can see why xd
"tech top gear" i'm imagining linus and luke being dropped into the bolivian jungle and having to build pc's out of sticks and snake carcasses.
that's awesome! also, same question regarding channel super fun.
so no big reaction to how they just won against a watercooled 980ti?
not sure if you frequent reddit, but there has been huge support and want for a "tech talks with linus" sorta thing where it is just down to earth discussion
this makes me feel as if you two are breaking up :(
you need to use 2 enters instead of 1 on reddit, otherwise the formatting is messed up
so when you buy an xbox one x, will it come in a box? if so, i suppose that will be an xbox one x box... i assume that some people may then re-purpose the aforementioned box, making it an ex xbox one x box... the word 'box' no longer has any meaning to me.
you're producing children? for linus? i am so confused.
that's fair enough i suppose. it not only appears to be an amazing work environment, but you get to be "famous" too! on that note, what are the basic qualifications you look for when you do hiring? who was the least qualified to be on your team before joining?
maybe virtualizating windows through iommu would help you? i'm going for a new setup with ryzen and definitely going that way
a common misconception. that series was a ton of fun to make and generated far more views and notoriety than we could have possible hoped for. huge success.
just take an old terrible camera, paint it red (by, like, dunking it in a paint can), and destroy it for april fools with the most clickbaity title you can come up with.
why didn't you guys show the teams discussing the challenge after the winner was decided? surely you asked them about their hard drive, and they asked you about some things? would've been interesting to see.
i can already tell /r/linuxmasterrace isn't gonna like this comment at all...
that's one of the main reasons for me at least. if not the biggest reason. never sell out.
instead of james yelling *hamond* it's luke yelling *dennis*
also i would watch the shit out a top gear/ltt cross over episode. i'm imagining the top gear team tries to build a kit car while the ltt team tries to assemble spike crazy pc inside of it. this is the collab i need in my life.
it's possible paul just got a better overclock still. his card was air cooled, but goddamn that was a massive cooler.
duly noted.. it's something we're considering, but we also don't want to force ourselves to create content because it's "popular". there's a fine line between engaging with the community and pandering. just trying to stay on the former side of it.
mm, linus and i played board games on the weekend at a tea party. we don't know what that makes us. yvonne and their kids were there too and they played as well. i think i was just a babysitter.
or add in two spaces after each line like that or just two enters note the spacing.
"dennis you knob! that was my garage ceiling! *sigh*"
no. reverse it. top gear has to build a pc and ltt has to build a car. no help can be given by either side. hilarity ensues
how about "tech walks with linus"? you can talk honestly about tech issues while walking places, climbing over cars, wading through bushes etc.
berkel left lmg last friday to create videos for pinkbike. look at the last wan show, nick and linus are on at the end and explain it.
lol...total. fucking. psychos. love it, oh god the rage was palpable in that video.
imagining the face of jeremy clarkson staring at an assortment of computer parts is already making me laugh
linus bear grylls maybe linus will end up in a future bear grylls series, dangling over a ravine.
thats actually pretty awesome pinkbike is a great group and he would fit in perfectly there... super jealous actually...
sure, but that kinda feels like the death of channelsuperfun though.
what was your reaction when super soakers became as successful as they did? are any of your other patents as recognizable in their respective fields? did super soakers help you jumpstart any of your other research either through funding or recognition
what's your opinion of foam dart guns? and do you have any good puns related to nuclear energy?
what's the strangest reaction you've come across when people find out you invented the super soaker?
will we ever see a toy water propulsion system better than the super soaker or is the super soaker the peak of toy water propulsion technology?
we can clearly see this product was a hit. can you tell us about one of your failures, or inventions that didn't "take off"? thanks for making childhood a blast
was it an instant success? how long did it take to become popular?
i remember the first time i saw a super soaker when my family was on vacation in florida. it was a super soaker 50 and i knew i had to have one. when we got home my mom got me one. my friend down the street got a super soaker 100 and i was never able to compete in a fire fight which made me so frustrated with my beloved ss50. i still schooled all of the plebs with inferior non ss products. that was fun. no question here. thanks for the memories! what are some of your favourite childhood toy memories?
is it true that the world of toy merchandising is super-cutthroat and full of industrial espionage?
is it true that you are working on a super super soaker contract for the department of defense?
hey man! how did you realize hasbro was undercutting your royalties? what are you doing for fun these days??
what is the secret to make a super soaker shoot really far?
what's the strangest use you've seen for a super soaker?
any wisdom to offer about life? clearly, you were a smart guy on a good path. but was there anything beyond, *oh, that would be a cool watergun*, that led you to create one of the most successful toys ever?
is there a super soaker model which reached an unexpected commercial success? likewise, is there a model which failed to meet expectations?
so, do you get free super soakers? if so, i can imagine that a weekend at grandpa's would be pretty awesome.
how does it feel to be a part of millions of people's childhoods?
do you have a giant wall / room in your house dedicated to displaying every super soaker ever made? if so, can we see this holy super soaker hall of fame of yours?
you said it was an accident, what were you working on or trying to create when you made the super soaker?
do you feel that other nuclear engineers judge you because of the super soaker? don't get me wrong, but in such a high-level industry, it feels very easy to become the "water toy" guy.
when it was being designed, did you or anyone else wonder, "hmm, are people going to convert these things into flamethrowers?"
what's your opinion on the fidget spinner? is it just a fad to be forgotten or a classic here to stay?
i understand that the jtec could be used at nuclear power plants. is it possible to apply that technology to nuclear reactors on aircraft carriers, or other nuclear powered vessels? if so, do you think there will ever be government contracts to install one of these converters on a carrier?
what is the best invention or idea you've had that for whatever reason never really materialized?
did you ever expect it to take off in popularity the way it did?
what kind of super soaker ideas were left on the cutting room floor?
do you feel that as the inventor of the super soaker it overshadows, or causes other scientists to be reluctant, of any scientific work that you undertake?
i gotta ask did the super soaker pay off ???? if so how comfortable are you?
i have many ideas, but so afraid to move forward in them because i fear they will be stolen and i well . . i don't think i can handle watching a million dollar idea be stolen from me while i cannot afford legal representation to fight it off. uh, how did you overcome that fear (if you had it that is)?
very sobering. "oh wow my life has changed". i had to sit down and think about what my life would be like going forward. i am responsible, to a large extent, for the success of the nerf dart gun line. yes
high performance dart guns were originally based on my patents. i hold them in high regard. i'm a nuclear engineer, and engineers aren't known for their humor.
there's a short half life to nuclear puns, they just aren't stable.
i went and gave a talk at a school, years ago, after the super soaker first came out. i told them that i had invented it, and they didn't believe me. i left the school with them never really accepting the idea that i had invented the water gun.
jammin' jet. it was commercialized. it was a water propelled airplane that was pumped just like a super soaker with water shooting out the back, propelling it into flight. the manufacturer changed the design of the plane to fly in a circle, but didn't adjust the wings so as it turned it would roll and dive into the ground. usually causing the plane to break after the first launch. exciting toy, exciting commercial, disappointing in the end.
i got the idea in '82, had a number of false starts, and it wasn't until '89 that i made the presentation to larami. it was on the market a year later in 1990 as the "power drencher". we changed the name in '91 to super soaker and because of the consistent sales success in both years by word of mouth, larami decided to run tv commercials. in 1992 it became the number 1 selling toy in the world.
in designing the gun i applied certain engineering principles with the idea of maximizing the distance that the gun could shoot, but at the same time designing it so that a small child would be able to pump it up to very high pressure. the design of the gun evolved over a period of years, litterally. the initial designs did not have a bottle on top. it wasn't until right before i presented the gun to larami that i put the bottle on top.
i have worked with and been funded by the department of defense in the past for my inventions. it's probably better that i not comment on the specifics of those contracts however.
i went to the toy store one day and saw a number of guns being sold under the n-strike name, and my royalty check did not reflect the number of guns i saw in the store. i took out my contract and did a close review. inventing energy converting technology and batteries that will be 2x better than lithium ion.
having high pressure and a relatively large nozzle. however, as you go to higher pressure and the water comes out faster, the stream breaks up in the air and limits how much further the water travels. there's an optimum combination of pressure and nozzle size.
i once used a super soaker to unclog a plugged up water drain at my home.
i saw a stripper on amateur night hand out super soakers to the audience as part of her act. totally nude joint, we all tried for a bullseye. funniest recollection of that night was looking over at a friend and he had water running down his face from getting so close to the stage.
i wanted to be an engineer long before i knew that "engineer" was the term that described what i wanted to do. i was tinkering as a little kid. always curious about the way things worked. since that time, what i've done has been to be persistent. so perseverance and continuing to hone your skills is the key to being successful in anything you do.
i went to the library and got a book on how to write patents. but before i submitted the patent i went to an air force patent attorney. he reviewed it as a favor, and told me it needed a lot of work. through working with him, and redrafting my patent, i learned how to file patents on my own. as a result i was able to file my first series of patents on my own. now i use a law firm to file my patents for me, but having an understanding of patents certainly helps to understand when you have a quality application.
the monster was the largest gun that larami produced. it was very badass in its look. but the seals around the nozzle had manufacturing defects that were not corrected, and it did not deliver on the promise that the appearance presented. it was a dual nozzle version of the cps 2500, and would've been great if it worked as well as the 2500.
i have in the past. we used to routinely get them when we were focused on improving them and redesigning them. but at this point in time i'm not really active in that sector.
i really appreciate the compliments people give about the water gun. it makes me want to do more to improve quality of life. i'm hopeful that my new technologies will help improve more lives. in fact, the heat pump that i was working on when i got the idea for the super soaker was being made to address an environmental problem.
yes and no. i do have a display of super soakers and i have a display of prototypes we built over the years. my collection is not complete, there are some that got away. periodically i'll go on ebay to find ones out of production, and some are stored away to protect them. the room in the background of my proof picture is the prototype "museum" we have at my laboratory.
when i made the super soaker i was trying to make a high performance water gun. the desire to make a high performance water gun occurred when i was shooting a stream of water from a nozzle i hooked to a bathroom sink while working on an air conditioner that would use water as a coolant instead of freon.
i have an invention on the galileo spacecraft which went to jupiter, and my fellow engineers at jpl were skeptical that it would successfully solve the problem we ran into. it went to jupiter in support of a very successful mission. i also invented an engine that converts heat into electricity more efficiently than perhaps any other engine and it has no moving mechanical parts. super soaker remains what i am most known for. i am confident that history will be kind to me.
that never occurred to me that people would do that with a water gun, but my philosophy is that everyone is an inventor. everyone has creative ideas, and hopefully most of them are productive.
well let's see. going very well. busy day. a number of meetings. i got to spend some time in the shop making some parts for my engine. i got an update from my team working on the solid state battery. got a hair cut. had a very good lunch. and now i'm enjoying my first time here on reddit.
i could be wrong. it'll stick around, but i suspect it'll go the way of the hula hoop.
the digital distance measuring instrument. patent no. 4143267 - it used photolithography to produce a binary encoded scale that could be read using an optical sensor and a magnifying glass. that is the base technology for dvds and cds. i received that patent in 1979. i was enjoying my day job working on space craft and was patenting for fun. knowing what i know now, it is the big fish that got away.
i sold a patent to mattel after the relationship with hasbro terminated. they created boomco rapid madness using my technology. i'm curious to see how well they'll do.
first off, you can't make money unless someone knows about it. secondly, i was willing to put my idea out there and to lose as long as i learned from the experience. i felt that subsequent ideas i had i would be able to use that experience to become successful.
i worked in the nuclear field on submarines for a couple of years. *somebody* has to have a sense of humor to decide to put handwheels in the least comfortable or usable spots
that's interesting. i had a toy as a kid that was a similar concept but it was just a plastic rocket. you pumped it up for a while and then it shot off propelled by the water pressure. did you have any hand in that?
well there went your problem. you had ljn manufacturer your toy. look up their nes games.
this is especially interesting, as someone born in 1988 and thus containing no memories pre-1992/93, i didn't realize that super soakers were brand new. i assumed they were one of those things that had been around for years. til.
working with dod on top secret super soaker project. not a question he can answer in an open setting. story checks out
thanks, now i have an excuse to buy one as an adult and the wife can't complain as thats what the inventor uses them for:-)
i used one to clean out my mailbox when i found maggots in there for some reason.
an engineer using his own invention to solve a completely unrelated problem! nice!!! i have a patent for a search engine/database management system (different type of engineer). i've used the search engine/indexing component as a poor man's method of bootstrapping a durable change log and event redrive/recovery mechanism for a completely different database years later. long story short, i cited my own patent for something completely different than its original use. it's still in use and is janky as shit!
i just got the wind knocked out of me when i saw you replied. thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions with real responses.
wow, is anyone else amazed that the creator of super soaker goes on ebay to find models he didnt get???
a swamp cooler? i always thought the biggest issue was you were pushing cold air in, but never pulling cold air out and the temperature of the cold air going in was never cold enough to make a difference. never any circulation. i grew up without true ac and swamp coolers is all we had.
holy fuck that was the supersoaker i had as a kid. thing was powerful as all hell and had an amazing range. i miss that thing
is there a reason you prefer the 2500 over the 2000?
have you thought about possibly working with one of the many lenr teams. they are able to generate extra heat but the best they can do is run an inefficient steam turbine to generate electricity. if high efficiency tecs were involved it would change the whole game. please look into this.
what is this solid state battery? and when will it be ready for release? may i buy some stock in the company releasing said battery?
i have never, in my time on this site, seen an ama op respond to so many questions: especially so thoroughly. you're sufficiently lauded, but you fucking deserve it.
welp, hula hoops *did* make a big comeback with the festival crowd when leds were added. maybe in the future fidget spinners can be revitalized by making them appealing to burners.
wait, i'm confused; if you received the patent, what did you miss? couldn't you have sued whoever marketed it, since you had ip protection in place?
all good, and thanks for the years of fun i had as a kid thanks to your inventions!
so if i asked you, the original king cool, slayer of the summer sun, beater of the heat, creator of awesome summer birthday parties and beach trips really reeeeeeally nicely, could i score a kick ass super soaker ?
"ideas are shit, execution is everything!" gary vaynerchuk
did they call it "cps" because it could get child protective services called on you?
the n-strike line was started based on my patents. and the whole thrust of my approach to nerf was to take nerf guns to much higher performance. shooting darts further. using rapid fire technology. making nerf more exciting than what it was prior.
close. *plasma* helium tanks. i call it the stupid soaker.
l j n that's why it failed, lonnie. that's why it failed.
same here, you would pump it up and then pull back on the little handle and it would shoot up. i know this toy. red translucent top and white bottom/fins.
i think james found one game they made that was good, it was spiderman for snes.
yeah and if i lift the seat too huh? nice try mom
good luck; if you want one powerful enough to do that you'll have to find it used. all the new "current-gen" super soakers are pretty small.
can't help but think of a dedicated scientist working for years to create some piece of advanced equipment only to have some buffoon come along and use it as a cheese grader
a guy named thundercool, receiving advice from a guy who embodies thundercool. that's thundercool, man.
swamp coolers are used in arid environments where the humidity is low. the evaporation of the water within the swamp cooler takes its heat of evaporation from air resulting in the air becoming cooler as the water evaporates into the air. in a swamp cooler you need a constant supply of water. in the heat pump i was working on, the water would circulate in a closed system similar to the way freon circulates in a typical ac or refrigerator. in that system the water evaporates because i create a low pressure point within the system and the heat of evaporation is extracted from the surroundings through a heat exchanger.
fuck i remember that thing. the water pressure was ridiculous. actually stung when someone shot you with it. (as a kid)
i can answer that one. the 2500 is a direct upgrade of the 2000. the 2500 has three different spray nozzles of different diameters. the smallest is similar to the 2000; the largest is genuinely like using a hose. it only lasts for a second before you've dumped the entire pressure chamber, but it will utterly and completely drench your target. small nozzle for protracted running fights, large nozzle for ambushes.
the solid state battery uses a solid electrolyte instead of liquid. so it's an all ceramic and metal battery with twice the storage capacity. we are in the process of transitioning the battery out of the laboratory. we have working cells at this point. there are improvements i'd still like to make. we have not yet set up an investment vehicle structure. stay tuned.
i think he used it as a measuring device, but cds had a different application with substantially similar tech. i think he's saying that he didn't see how it could be used like that when he filed.
cd's were released in 1982. he had the technology in 1979 but didn't use it to invent cds.
maybe if you posted under a different username ;()
i just want to say thank you for letting me rapid strike my wife with foam darts from across the room. she'd probably curse your name, but for me it's just fantastic.
i'm not a patent attorney, and i 100% agree with this comment. i took 2 ip classes in law school, and i would consider it malpractice on my part to take a patent case now. it's a really complicated field; if you think you have a real winner of an idea, call your states bar association and they should be able to point you to someone qualified. edited for clarity
what's the most common mistake people make when writing a patent?
i helped a guy working on his phd who was doing work to show that evaporative cooling is efficient depending upon the humidity and the temperature. basically he calculated that in tropical climates, it was efficient and was at the stage of building the measuring gear to prove it.
the kid who had that ruled the yard. none of us could hang with it and yes it stung
isn't the 2000 regarded as more powerful, despite the shorter duration of super soaking?
that's not how patents work. if he legitimately had that specific of a patent, he would have been able to force the industry to pay dearly for it
sadly, a lot of the stuff you mention is most likely what is going to make it get complained about by parents :(
dude, that's nothing special. we all rapid strike your wife.
"the chemicals used in this product are known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects" but it's just plastic and water!
isn't this just undergrad thermodynamics? or was he accounting for various higher-order effects?
as someone from florida who has had occasion to visit the arizona/nevada deserts, this sounds either wrong or like it relies on defining efficiency in a way where the result is meaningless.
it's even more entertaining when you fill it with hot (not scalding of course) or cold water. the surprised wtf looks your friends get when they first get hit is priceless. then when they are no longer surprised, fill it with pee and you'll never have friends again! it's the perfect toy for introverts who were forced to go outside and "it's a beautiful summer's day".
maybe it has to do with humidity? sorry, i don't know the maths or full details behind it, only that i thought it was interesting when he explained it to me. to cut and weld pipe, sling a hacksaw and a drill, i left most of my uni level maths well behind me now.
you just reminded me of a memory that i haven't thought of in years. at camp when i was a kid we had a huge water balloon fight. water guns, balloons, water slingshots, you name it. anyways, this kid, jacob, he filled a bucket with water and then he peed in it. and he just went up to some girls and dumped it on them. and then he told them it had pee in it, and then he got kicked out of camp. each move makes less sense.
i think it was a little bit later, i want to say it was red, blue, and grey with a massive rear tank and an adjustable nozzle. i had a 50 and 100 and this was the upgrade at like age 10. such great toys.
were you ever paranoid that you'd received bait money or that somebody saw you get into your vehicle, or were you really that calm? i don't have the bone in my body that would allow me to do something like rob a bank, but if i did i would imagine id be super paranoid about trying to deposit the money.
was your wife or family aware that you were robbing banks? was this a dirty secret?
what's the most cash you ever got from a single robbery?
how much thought and planning did you put into it beforehand? did you have a clean getaway car, pre selected route, etc? did you scout banks and pick the best times? or did you just decide to up and hit one?
would you want your experiences to be made in to a movie?
if you'd be able to tell your 10 year old self one thing, what line of crime would you recommend him?
do you think you'll ever rob a bank again? if not, why not?
how do you think the world of robbing banks has changed since you were doing it? while the cameras are slightly better than they used to be, it seems that very few bank robbers actually get caught barring ridiculous stupidity. even those whose faces are caught on camera walk out of the bank with typically a couple grand and no consequences thereafter. considering it is a federal offense, i am curious as to how seriously you believe law enforcement takes some of these robberies, given how small the quantity of money is and nobody being harmed in the process. it seems as though, given the lack of news coverage on such small time jobs and the lack of anyone ever being caught, that someone could easily rob a bank or two and continue life and working their 9-5 job as though nothing ever happened
if you drop an object into the goal of a foosball table (let's say a cell phone) and you can't get it out by hand is there any way to remove it without somehow destroying the table?
how did it feel always living on the edge like that? always looking over your shoulder and trying not to get arrested?
is it a lot harder to get a job after robbing banks?
did you ever leave a calling card, or take any trivial souvenirs?
i am an unarmed security guard that worked in a variety of banks to be that first response for when people rob banks. so if you ever seen that commercial where someone robs a bank and everyone turns to the security guard and say, "i'm not a security guard. im a security monitor", that's me! my question: when you see a 3rd party officer, is what is your reaction and what do you to get around them? does it make the robbery and easier. because i always said as soon as someone pointed a weapon or threatened my life, i was quiting right there.
do you feel guilty about how the tellers must have felt being robbed?
let's cut the shit here and tell us, are there bank robber groupies?
first off, thanks for the book, secondly, the heist scene in heat (i.e. where they're actually in the bank / controlling the staff and punters) *felt* pretty authentic, was it? also, what other films have shown the craft well?
how many years of your sentence did you actually serve? i see in your attached proof the sentence date is 2008 for 20 years, so release 2028, but as far as i am aware it is 2017.
what are your thoughts on your fifth grade teacher?
what was your education level at the time of your crime spree and do you feel anything in your upbringing would have swayed you from not robbing banks? i would rather my children not rob banks for fun.
i was robbed at gunpoint when i was 20. i have a lot of hatred towards the man who decided that was a good idea. it made me have panic attacks and eventually caused me to quit a job i loved and was good at. do you ever think about the tellers who were on the other side? do you feel any remorse for what you put them through?
when you decided to turn yourself in, how long did you expect your sentence to be?
i am very curious, if you never wore a mask or gloves, how were you never caught? also how did you handle the threat of being caught at any time of any day?
if a teller had refused to give you any money, what would you have done? did that ever happen?
what was it specifically about robbing banks that appealed to you? why not any other type of theft/crime?
was your family in shock when they found out you were going to prison? what was they're reaction? i saw in your previous ama that you only admitted to robbing three of the countless banks you robbed, could you still be tried for any remaining robberies if they figured it out/potentially see a thread like this? thank you in advance! i am very intrigued by your story and just want to wish you well for whatever the futre holds for you.
this probably a naive question, but we're you nervous when going to jail? because everyone seems to make it out like if you don't join a group in there your just going to get shanked or some shit.
how did cameras never catch you or how did the teller never report your face?
i'm about to start grad school in order to become a psychologist working in the prison system, is there anything that you experienced in prison that you would be willing to share in order to give me a better idea of what i'm getting myself into?
how was dave ramsey off mic? lame question, but honestly just wanted to say thanks for the book and you were definitely the most interesting guest on the show.
is there anything a teller could have done to spoil your plans? if so, what?
odd question... if you take your total haul and divide it by your time served in hours plus the time to commit and plan the work... what are your hourly earnings for robbing a bank over your lifetime?
i think i know you. did you ever live on the 23rd floor of a building in austin?
what would you do if the teller said no when you handed them the note demanding money? i use to be a teller and was always curious what would happen if i refused.
would you consider bank robbing a sort of "gateway illegal activity" and you still crave the feeling of doing something bigger or have you just called it quits?
what did your notes say? why would people just hand you money in exchange for a note
if you didn't go to prison would you be better or worse?
i robbed banks too! small world huh? yeah my parents and siblings never suspected a thing when i took an extra 20 or 50 from the monopoly bank. i knew only to take small bills so they wouldn't get suspicious. so glad i got that off my chest. i feel better now.
no. i asked for $50s and $100s only. everything i'd understood about bait money was that they only came in $20s, so nothing to worry about there if you specifically demand the other non-$20 denominations. and i wasn't worried anyone would see me getting into my vehicle because i parked out of view (i.e., on the other side of another building).
i didn't tell my wife or my best friend or anyone. i didn't want to burden either of them with that. but that's not the real reason i didn't tell them. i just know that your chances of getting caught skyrocket when you start blathering on about it to others. i didn't feel like it was a dirty secret either. it was just one of those things that i did every now and then. i'm a private person, so it didn't bother me keeping it to myself.
nothing was really going through my mind at all during the process. intellectually, i definitely knew what i was doing. but otherwise, i just tried to remain in the mindset that i was there to do a thing and the bank tellers were also there to do a thing. i tried to avoid thinking of myself as a criminal doing bad things. i didn't want the anxiety that came with that. and sorry, but no i haven't seen that movie. i hardly watch movies at all, much less suspense movies. i like movies like office space and liar, liar.
- walked in. - stood in line. - waiting for the next available teller. - handed them a note asking for their money. - turned around and left.
not a lot. the most i got from a single robbery was maybe $7k.
i put a lot of thought and planning into the first one. i probably spent five months obsessing over all of the details, possibilities, etc. once i got the nerve to finally give it a go and everything worked as planned, it was pretty much copy-and-paste from then on. i didn't scout banks, per se, but i did have an idea of what i was looking for. i didn't want to hit a stand alone bank. i wanted to be able to park my vehicle within walking distance yet out of sight from the bank (i.e., on the other side of an adjacent building). as for the best times, i usually opted for some time around 3pm since i figured that's when shift-change would likely be for the local police.
pretty normal, for the most part. i have two sons that i raise together with their mother (my ex-wife). i spent a lot of time during 2012-2014 in the oil fields working my life away to try and get out of debt, but once that was all said and done, i started spending a lot more time at home with my boys. i travel a little here and there to do some speaking engagements, and i also love to travel for foosball tournaments. i also play foosball locally twice a week. other than that, i have a typically quiet life.
i wish i had something more legitimate to blame like addiction or desperate financial circumstances or anything else. unfortunate truth is it just seemed like it would be exciting, and i enjoyed the thought of trying to get away with something like that. i didn't have very many healthy avenues to pursue excitement, adrenaline, etc.
well he got the money. he probably was caught, but the link said nothing of the sort. in contrary, 4chan was hooking him up with an escape from the city and some false tips. i'm genuinely curious if his armed driver showed up and delivered on his promise.
so my first ama pretty much went viral and a gazillion people reached out to me for this very thing. i ended up meeting a really great producer who is doing a documentary type film, and i can't wait to see what he does with it. i don't know that i'm at liberty to say much about it, but he is awesome and i'm glad i met him. hopefully will have some news on that soon.
my 10 y/o self was trying to cope with his parents divorcing and not understanding how to fit in at school. he wouldn't have listened to a damn thing i said anyway and probably would have done the exact opposite anyway. more than anything, i think i'd just tell him to hang in there and things won't be bad forever. i'd tell him that his parents still loved him even if they didn't always know how to show it, and i'd challenge him to actually try to appreciate school instead of trying to make it hell on every teacher in his path. 10 y/o kids don't have a fucking clue in life and are in that really awkward phase of *too young to care for themselves* and *too old to have everything done for them*. i'd probably tell him to become a hacker.
first of all, i am standing up while typing this and there's nothing you can do to stop me. nah, i can't imagine ever wanting to do that shit again. i like my life, and i'm happy. that's something i never had for the first few decades of my life. there's just no appeal to do certain things as you get older and for me, this falls into that category.
this is a fun conversation to have, and i actually will have a really cool opportunity to go to an event later this year and talk with banking professionals about it. i'm excited. cameras are a shit ton better today than they were in 2006. plus, we have social media in a way that only existed in our worst nightmares back then. it's a lot different these days. with that said, it's still just not really that big of a priority for banks to catch robbers. they're not really losing *that* much money to robberies. if you do it how i was doing it, you're not going to really raise any eyebrows. on the other hand, if you're going in guns blazing and wrecking shop, they're going to put a lot more of their resources into catching you... ...because if you hurt a customer during a robbery, that's going to cost way more money than a few thousand dollars from teller b. and i agree with your last sentence.
buy couple cases of beer (cheaper than cell phone). invite friends over to enjoy said beer and play football under the condition that they help you invert the table and shake your phone out.
damn right, it is. and not just because of the crime, but just because of being a felon in general. although it's technically illegal to discriminate based on that, companies aren't so quick to hire an ex-con. thankfully, it's still america and there's always opportunity if you try hard enough. no complaints from me.
if i saw an officer of any kind, third party or not, there's no way i was sticking around to rob the place. so your presence alone can prevent a certain amount of crimes, i'm sure. the downside is the people who don't care you're there also do not care if they have to hurt you. at a glance, i think your comment kind of sounds like you're probably in the wrong business. that sounds so stressful.
probably. i don't know. i don't think i'd want anything to do with that crowd.
i've never seen that movie, but generally speaking, hollywood tends to really get bank robbery wrong. granted, if they painted a more accurate picture of bank robbery, it would be terribly boring and nothing people would want to pay to see. hollywood portrays bank robbery about like the porn industry portrays sex.
my sentence was 36 months. i served 39 months because i didn't get credit for all of my county time. i think you misread the proof. the crime carries *up to* 20 years, but that wasn't my sentence.
she was terrible. she's one of the few people i mentioned by name in my book. she was just a terrible, terrible person.
i do think about the tellers. there's not really much i can do about the impact my choices had in their lives, but i'm open to anything that would be productive in the matter. i hate to admit it, but i really just don't feel a lot of remorse. in a lot of ways, i've grown a bit detached from who i was back then, so perhaps there's some denial at play (or some other kind of psychological explanation), but i do think about those folks and if there's anything i could ever do to resolve any issues that arose from what i did.
i was expecting more like a decade or so. i wasn't really sure, but i definitely expected way more than three years.
not specifically, but i knew that larger chains were less likely (among other things) to have some hero waiting to pounce if you robbed them.
that varies depending on what i'm eating. there aren't many cheeses i don't like (except for weird ones like pepperjack). on chicken tacos, i love colby & monterey jack. on beef tacos, i'd probably go with plain old shredded cheddar. if i'm eating a cheeseburger, i usually get cheddar or american. if i'm eating italian food, i'm probably going to just ask for every single cheese they have. three-cheese lasagna? yes, please. five-cheese pizza? sure thing! i've never been to an italian restaurant that had any kind of cheese i didn't approve of. in chess, however, i prefer the king's gambit when playing white and the sicilian when playing black.
bummer about your dad, but i'm guessing there are a few other things that might be different about his situation compared to mine. did he have priors? it sucks that it would matter, but the feds take that into account.
nope. i don't think i've ever been above the third story of any building in austin.
it's what tellers are trained to do. they aren't supposed to play hero and risk anyone getting hurt, so if you hand them a note that says "i have a gun. give me all the money." they're going to do it.
used to work at a credit union. it was a tracker between two different $20s but strapped in $500 so you wouldn't be able to tell on the spot. they gave me that and another strap that was obviously fake so the robber would throw that one away, thinking the was the tracker
money that you spend on worms and stuff when you go fishing. in all seriousness, it's money where the bank has recorded the numbers on it so if someone robs the bank and gets the bait money the fbi can have something else to try and track the robber when they start spending it.
ha, that's awesome.... my small talk "i have succulents"
this sounds familiar - was it you on the criminal podcast? i loved that episode.
how is that enough for them to give you the money? it would seem you present no threat whatsoever.
sheesh...7k? that seems so low. do the teller machines limit what they can pull w/o pre-authorization?
too bad you didn't get any gold, like /u/rabidroosters is going to get in a few minutes *edit* to the downvoters: it was small humor before i gilded someone. geez people, relax.
i played low-level foosball tournaments back in the day. what's your opinion of players who stop the ball, then proceed to play mind-games, circling their man around the ball before slapping it in a table shaking strike. i used to play against italian fellows who never let that ball stop for more than a split-second---it was a pleasure to be beaten by them.
he was caught. i saw the news article about it on 4chan. currently in prison, i want to say he's due out later this year.
nice! a skill set where great crimes lead to light prison sentences and job offers.
dammit, i was sitting down whilst reading this. have we broken the internet?
why do you reckon bank robbery isn't more common if indeed it is this easy even today?
step 1: get friends step 2: get money step 3: become 21
appreciate the ama. although quick note, it's actually not illegal to discriminate based on felony, or even misdemeanor status. it's common and legal to not hire someone with a background of shoplifting for a retail position, drug dealing to work in a pharmacy, or child abuse to work at a school or daycare. some states and municipalities don't run a background check until after they've interviewed you and only then consider if your background is related to the type of work you will be doing. but in at-will employment states at least, they can run a background check on a prospective employee, and just say "they're a felon, so i assume they are a bad person, and i don't want to hire them" and that is completely legal.
i don't get how that works. how could you convince a teller to give you money just by giving them a note? sorry for my ignorance
haha, awesome. thanks for the answer. where is the money stashed???
was there any part of you that said "let's just not tell anyone about what i did, pretend it never happened, stop robbing banks, and hope the past never catches up with me?" tbh i think i would be reeeeeally tempted by that idea, especially with a young son in the picture.
ah i see. what is county time? i'm from the uk, is that like what we call community service or similar? yes i believe i did, my bad, does that mean you didn't get a fine at all or just didn't get the full fine of $250,000?
so smaller places like credit unions were more likely to have security?
he did have priors, but the feds didn't want him. the state gave it to him.
true. i believe it varies by institution. the one i worked at only used 20s, perhaps he knew this about the places he was robbing.
so you're saying if i rob a bank i should throw all the real money away and keep all the fake money.
you look suspicious if you walk into a bank wearing a mask and gloves.
i saw the first one when i was a kid and liked it. i need to check out the new one, but i still haven't. i'm pretty excited about cars 3 next friday though.
unfortunately yes, that was me. glad you enjoyed it, but that podcast is the reason i'll never do another interview that isn't live. i'd give anything to get my hands on the unedited audio from our interview/conversation and re-release it somehow.
we are suppose to give you the money. we have cash set aside with serial numbers logged the we give. you don't need to be threatful at all, nobody will stop you.
i was a teller for a few years and we got into deep shit if we had more than a couple grand at a time. we actually got warnings every transaction where our drawer balance was over a certain amount, and we were supposed to move the excess to the vault. it was specifically for this reason, if we had six grand in our drawer and got robbed, you bet your ass we'd get fired. getting robbed isn't a teller's fault, but there are procedures in place to mitigate the bank's loss should a robbery happen. if a robbery happened while we were insanely busy and didn't have time to move money, it probably would have been let go, but if you were over your limit and had a free moment, you'd better get rid of that shit.
thanks dude, you took my gold virginity! i'll remember to pay it forward! now i just have to figure out what to do with it.
link? i've been reading the news about it the last 30 minutes, not seen anything about him being caught. last i heard, 2 days after the robbery, he was still a free man. and a lot of that blog on 4chan seems to happen before that. which means he probably did get out of the city. would be interesting if they caught him after that, would love to see more.
nobody is getting a job after getting caught these days. the prison sentences also aren't light anymore. you'll get fucked harder than if you literally just rob a bank.
i think it's a lot more common than people realize. but there are stories/studies talking about the gradual decline over recent years, and my best guess is that it's just easier to do other forms of the same thing via identity theft and other digital crimes.
the analogy i usually use is ordering a big mac at mcdonald's. the cashier doesn't question whether or not you have money. they are just following procedure. when someone orders food, they punch their computer and proceed as trained. tellers are trained to follow instructions. if you tell them to give you money, they do it.
this. seriously. time has passed, they have no trail of you... i'd have gone on with life.
interesting. any idea why a bank robbery video wouldn't have made the news? does it happen often enough that they don't want the negative publicity?
speaking of the inertia thing reminds me of the so called phases that serial killers go through. specifically, that after the crime has happened there is a sense of relief that eventually builds into a desire to do it again. you said that you did this mostly for the adrenaline aspect of it, did you ever have the relief feeling after robbing a bank and then have a point afterwards where you get depressed and start craving the adrenaline rush again? for serial killers, this craving can be so powerful that there is hardly anything that can stop it from happening again. by the way, i am in no way equating you to a serial killer. it just seems that this rush of adrenaline from a crime is very similar to theirs and that rush has been extensively studied specifically for killers and hardly anyone else beyond addicts.
you also look pretty fucking suspicious robbing a bank, too...
oh so you were just kind of waiting in line and would just tell the teller you were robbing them? when you'd leave.... would your car not have a license plate, or how would you stop them from tracking you from the camera footage?
i've got so many cultivars of jade. classic, hummel's sunset, gollum, coral, fingers, undulating, and two variegated (one yellow stripes, the other white stripes). can't afford to collect anything more challenging yet. don't you think jade looks lovely with a hint of string of pearl?
i remember u saying in your previous ama you turned yourself in to start a family. how are the kids?
how much is set aside? and would someone waving a gun and yelling cause you to give them more or is it just to apease the robber and get him to leave?
the registers at my store work like that. after a few grand it'll say "drop needed soon" every transaction to drop soon, then over a certain amount it'll say "drop needed now" and refuse to do anything until you to drop.
i would think the reason for this has less to do with limiting the bank's exposure to a loss, as it's still relatively peanuts either way for a bank. but by limiting the amount of cash available to take in a robbery, it lessons the motivation to commit a robbery in the first place.
haha clean your cars while cleaning your money! that's very robinhood-ish! we had a debate in ethics class about the morality of giving to charity for the pleasure one received from giving and whether or not it's selfish. the general consensus was that even tho it may not be selfish to some it's still a good thing to do. thanks for doing the ama it's very interesting
you'd be an interesting contribution to the age old psychological debate of whether or not true altruism exists!!
while you were in jail we all decided to stop saying that
i read in his other ama that he partially turned himself in because he didn't want to risk the law catching up with him later in his son's more meaningful, memorable years (which he insinuates here). still, he said somewhere in here that he theoretically could've gone to jail for 20+ years so...if the law had ruled for that, he probably would've never really ended up a father figure for his son, as much of the need for a father would've been gone by the time he got out. hmmm.
i think the mental glitch is probably the same, regardless of the crime, so i understand where you're coming from with the serial killer analogy. the simple answer is no, i never felt a relief. it was more similar to the kind of feeling you get when you win a competition of some sort. it's just a good feeling. and you celebrate for a while, sure, but then you eventually go back to competing because that's just what you enjoy (if you're a competitor).
the key difference is not looking suspicious before you've started robbing the bank.
great. one is playing nba 2k17 at the moment. he's pretty good, but he can't quite hang with me yet. he always picks the warriors and just tries to rain 3's on my head, so i pick someone like the clippers and just big-man the shit out of him. if/when he learns how to move the ball around for 20 seconds or so instead of insta-shooting, i'll be screwed because i don't know a lot about video games anymore. but for the time being, i'm god. my other kid is trampolining right now, and i don't even compete with him. i can't hang. that shit is nowhere near as fun as it used to be. dad life is pretty cool.
drive your own car. drive too quickly as you leave. drop some bills, spend too long picking them up, have cops meet you at the door. seriously, bank robbery has an insanely low success rate.
that's probably a good thing. we could have been tens of thousands of dollars over and all we'd have to do is click "ok" on the warning that we were over in order to continue. probably not good if you're in a fucking bank.
the car wash bit was a joke i stole from the first ama. :) i'd love to sit in on a debate like that in class, however. i don't believe altruism is real, and i believe most people are generally selfish. i think robinhood's intent were so much different than mine, so i usually cringe at the comparison. let me frame it this way... i wasn't doing bad in the name of good. i was just doing bad and then had money left over because of it. the money was a byproduct of bad, and there were no good intentions up to the point that i had the money. but then, i had money and wanted to serve my ego yet again, so i gave it away and enjoyed the *wow, you're so generous and helpful* in a selfish way. unfortunately, that is a more accurate depiction.
so i take it you were competing against the police? it's either that or the banks. that's an incredibly high risk game to play, and knowing the end results is why most people don't play that game. this is why your mind is interesting, you saw the high stakes and chose to play anyways, most likely knowing full well that almost no one has played that game and actually won (in other words, were never caught). there's a certain appeal there to everyone else in the world, since we can vicariously play that game through yours and others experiences with it.
just like payday. walk in with all your body armour and assault rifles but don't put your mask on until it's time to look suspicious.
haha technically yes it is a low chance of success. the solve rate is one of the highest of all crime types, but that's still only 50-60 percent solve rate. so you almost have a 50/50 shot. which in the grand scheme of things shows you how bad the police are at solving the total amount of crimes.
according the movies all you need is equipment to drill up from the steam tunnels below and a competent locksmith. not sure how you'd deal with that watermark, tho.
was the car wash joke from the first ama a reference to breaking bad? im just curious
wow, if he made it 12 days, that means he was almost certainly caught from his 4chan posts. i'm guessing he made it home and sat around while le identified him. he literally posted the craigslist ad of somebody he had called/emailed, how retarded can you be? why even use a proxy at that point? at some point his skype was posted as well. really hope someone gets in touch with him and gets him to do an ama
what was your fine, and how did they get the money? did they seize any assets or just garnish your jail earnings (if you had a job)?
probably more along the lines of competing against other criminals or just "chance" in general. i never actually felt like i was actively engaged with the police. but yeah, the high stakes risk stuff was appealing.
i let my 6yr old son play payday 2. we would play together hit banks and jewelry stores. bond and stuff. today he put a ski mask on. said "let's get some money." he is 9 now. i questioned my decision, for a brief moment. then i asked him, "when are they coming out with 3. he looked at me and said" we need to be fast."
quality content from the taco bell c-e-o. now i see why they are the only restaurant around in 2032.
at the same time, he's literally an hour's drive away from the scene of the crime. what the hell was he doing for those 12 days? the guy obviously didn't read the part about where our reddit ama bank robber spent half a year on his first robbery. definitely a thrill seaker, got 3 years for it. it'll be more than a year before we can ask him for an ama.
i didn't make any money in prison. when i got out, i had restitution of $150/mo until the balance was paid in full. i paid it off early.
might just be me, but perhaps this wasn't the right game for his age. stick to mario and minecraft.
*hands note* give me your fucks, in units of flying fucks.
eh kinda related, but i used to work at a cvs which had an alarm button for robberies. however, it had been disconnected, and they had told us this, due to it being deemed safer for everyone to just give the robbers what they wanted without causing a scene.
i live in houston, and worked for the da in a felony court, a bank gets robbed everyweek...they mostly get away if they arent retarded and get i'ded or blab their mouth too much. let your stubble grow out a week or three, wear a hat, baggy clothes, sunglasses, and dont have any visible tattoos. dont speak, give them the note, if you have to speak practice what youre going to say in a different accent or pitch so its sounds natural. figure out the general bank procedure for slipping marked bills(hint its probably online) dont park in front of a camera.
well that's what i'm saying. he probably lived in the county where he was caught. he said the taxi was 200 bucks which sounds about right for a 1 hour drive. so after the heist, he made it home, sat around and jerked it to mlp, then 12 days later there's a knock on the door. and that aug 2018 is his scheduled date, idk when he'll actually get out. how many people actually serve their full sentences?
ok thanks. are you not allowed to say the total amount fined?
are public land giveaways determined by congress or are their things that state/local governments can do to chip away at these protections?
they must have kept this very quiet, given that i work for one of the agencies in charge of these public lands and am completely unaware of these attempts at sell-offs. with that in mind, can i ask you what you think of the state owned vs. federally owned public lands argument? for those of you that grew up (like i did) back east, you may not be aware of what a privilege it is to have public lands out here in the west. cattle and people both roam freely out here, there is land aplenty for recreation of all kinds, it really is an entirely different feeling than the eastern half of the country where there is a constant questioning of whose land you're on and if you're allowed to be there doing what you're doing.
not sure if this is quite relevant, but what kind of enforcement do lumber companies have in making national forest land "private"? i'm a big fan of my local nf, el dorado national forest, but when just wandering around or exploring it's almost impossible to really explore and enjoy the isolation due to "no trespassing, property of (lumber company)" signs that seem to surround both sides of every road that keep anyone from really going anywhere off the road. on top of that, they put up locked gates, metal barriers or just simply tear up the forest with bulldozers to make trenches to keep people out. is this legal?
how do you feel about tribes buying culturally important land?
is it possible for private citizens to purchase these lands? there's some state owned adirondack parkland near me that my family would love to take under our stewardship, if only to assure its well-being.
are there specific companies that profit from this?
considering how, in the west of the country, enormous amounts of states' lands lie in federal hands, can it really be said that vast untapped territories are really rendering the nation any service? why is it ethical for the federal government to requisition land and bar the public from purchasing it? what of states' sovereignty?
out of curiosity, and it may have little to do with the issue, but is that anything like the eminent domain issues were currently facing in the small town where i live?
what can i do to have the government give me free public land? i then want to turn around and sell it to somebody else for a profit. ideally, i'd like my land to be mineral rich or oceanfront. you know what? just let them know i'll take all of it. i'm not even greedy, i'll settle for half. please and thank you. also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?
* how would you get the two sides to start communicating? i know people like to play the blame game, but it's the fault of who's in charge of both parties * media is here to sway people's opinions reporting on things without facts. when did the media take such a bad turn?
what can we do to get hunters and hikers to partner up and protect public lands?
how recoverable will these lands be? unless america continues on its current path of self destruction and ignorance, i am forced to believe the next president will be a sane one who will want to undo this. how easily can it be undone, if at all? are the drilling practices they plan to use going to permanently damage these areas? once given away can we not get them back? what is the long-term assessment for regaining these lands for the public or have we lost them for good?
where can i get information on how i can buy this land? is it just going to be auctioned off?
why don't you think states should oversee their own land? could you explain your position on that? shouldn't people that live in that state control the land there not someone in d.c.?
what other people/organizations do you feel are doing the most to fight against the transfer of federal land? is there anyone or any organizations that you feel could do the greatest amount of good with our support?
what's the problem in giving land back to the states to take care of? seems like it's a 6 to one, half a dozen to the other scenario??
is the land actually decent? aka not like when they sold it to fools gold rushers back in the day? or will people be stuck with 5 acres of gorgeous desert in the middle of nowhere? can you choose your location? is this some sort of land lease program where you'll have to give the government every cent you make off the land until you die - aka what's the catch?
why do you support unconstitutional federal holding of property? how is it ok for 80% of nevada to be federal instead of state or private, when the feds have no enumerated power to hold it and by common law the lease holders should have ownership rights?
i'm a baby journalist, freshman in college! any advice on breaking into the industry? i already schmooze with the higher ups for advice and work on the school paper, trying to open an investigative unit.
what's your stance on the vast federal lands in the western united states? should those not designated as parks or military bases be given back to the states?
i'm a libertarian, i firmly believe that the government should not be involved with anything & a great stepping stone toward that would be states rights. that being said, my least "libertarian" stance is that of the environment. there needs to be a "higher power" to protect our gorgeous land. i would much rather national parks exist by the state than say, mcdonald's. what is the difference between federal land & state land? shouldn't individual states decide what to do with their land?
do you seriously consider yourself a non-biased journalist with no personal agenda here?
how is giving away federally owned land to the states wrong? it's absolutely silly for the federal government to own vast tracks of land and charge people for its usage. the government doesn't in any way use "public lands" responsibly by not allowing the states to use it. local governments exist for a reason, because local governments can serve local interests. if you want the land used responsibly you should want the land to be under the control of the people who live there, not under the control of the federal government which is phenomenally difficult for anyone to hold to account.
so why is this a bad thing? it gives people the opportunity to purchase land? land is only going to appreciate so it looks like a great investment opportunity for people.
what's the matter with the federal government giving land to the states in which those lands exist?
**this**, so much this. toured up the west coast with open roads through all the federal lands and beachfront with nary a sign of barbwire or private properties for hundreds of miles!! what, you mean just pull off the road and camp on a beach like it's your own back yard? exactly like that, and it's like nothing else i've experienced. freedom exemplified. east coast touring, not so much. in fact, not even close. hundreds of miles of barbed wire, pastures, no trespassing signs, paid lodgings, lakes, grounds, everything privately owned/pay to stay and keep on moving to the next hotel. truly two very different sides of a single coin.
this is a very good point. we geologists consider public lands (particularly those in the western states) to be indispensable. we map public land, we conduct research on public land, and we learn more about economic development from surveying public land. the thought of future generations being barred from these resources as a result of private ownership saddens me. there is simply no substitute.
yes exactly. as a utahn i really hope we can keep it the way it is. there's so much open land free for camping, hiking, hunting, target shooting, atv riding, whatever. and it's often free. unfortunately people here (especially the state legislature) are eager to sell it off to various private interests such as miners, oil and gas, or resort development. but once it's gone it's gone forever. there's already quite a bit of land that my dad used to hunt and fish when he was younger that's now private and marked "no trespassing".
how does that work with cattle grazing on public land? do they rent it or something? what if one farmer monopolies an area
as someone who works for a federal agency i guess i shouldn't be shocked to find out that you don't realize the executive branch executes the will of the congress. you would have no idea from interactions in your workplace unless you directly interact with congress. there no vast conspiracy. many in the west would prefer to manage our public lands ourselves and some proposals are transfers from feds to the states. for goodness sake the vast majority of your agencies-managed land is west of the mississippi yet washington knows what's best for those lands they flyover.
considering those roads you're driving on were built and paid for by said lumber companies.....
i would like an answer on this as i have mixed feelings about it. on paper i think it's awesome. but atleast in my part of the country it seems like everywhere is cultural, spiritual, or historical to native tribes. its not just like an acre where they buried their dead. its chunks of huge square miles.
you know that reid is no longer a senator, right? and that article is from 2009?
good question. groups that back land transfer, like the american lands council and the mountain states legal foundation, have received funding from industry groups. mslf has received money from texaco, phillips petroleum, u.s. steel, the coors foundation and exxonmobil. the american lands council, which has employed utah state rep ken ivory, has received funding from fossil fuel interest/koch-backed alec and americans for prosperity.
the federal government isn't requisitioning these lands, these are lands that for the most part were never claimed during the homestead act and never left the possession of the federal government
hey! i'd love to hear more about the eminent domain issues where you live. if it's about federal mismanagement of land, we might cover it in this series. if it's a national story but not right for this series, i'll pass it along to another editor. thanks for your time! [first name].[last name]@theguardian.com
seems sort of futile to me, aren't republicans against federally owned anything?
actually, hunters and anglers are some of the biggest proponents for the protection of public lands. a portion of the profit from each piece of hunting and fishing gear sold is earmarked for conservation. there are also a myriad of land conservation nonprofits that are largely hunter/angler backed.
you would need millions to buy a national park plus the money for upkeep.
hey, thanks for this! on my way out, but this is a question that i answered more fully in a few other responses. in brief: backcountry hunters and anglers and the teddy roosevelt conservation partnership have made a huge impact this spring
i've lived in four of the states on this list, and i'm completely comfortable with it. these lands belong to all of us, and every future american. i don't want corrupt state legislators lining their pockets by robbing future generations of the right to visit and see these lands unmolested.
these lands were never owned by the states. that's why. and the last time the government tried to give the land to the states, they didn't want it. and the same will be true this time. the states will only want land that has water and can be developed, exploited, or ruined.
her silence on this is telling... i really enjoy our public land, and want to keep it government owned, but we should also consider that we have a shitload of it in places like nevada and utah. as cool as bears ear is, there are also hundreds of other really cool places in utah. protect a lot of it, but dont rob utah of their sovereignty.
article 4, section 3, clause 2 it's in the constitution, also kleppe vs. new mexico for the supreme court's opinion on it
jus to note, it wouldn't giving that land back to the states. federal land in the west with few exceptions never belonged to states in the first place
federal land = purchased by the federal government, and usually managed through blm or the national parks service. state land = purchased by state governments or gifted to them by the federal. as enshrined in the constitution, the power of the federal government supersedes that of state governments. states should certainly have the power to decide what to do with the lands that they own, but the federal government has the power to decide what to do with the land that they in turn own. i'm addition, if a state is mismanaging its lands in a way that is to the detriment of multiple states (for example, pollution that runs through rivers to other states), it's the federal government's responsibility to step in and protect these lands, in order to make the will of people in outside states that are being affected known.
is it even remotely possible for any intelligent human being to not have a personal agenda on saving the planet ? including our protected lands? i mean.......?
the problem with local governments owning these vast tracts of land is mainly that they cannot afford it, so after a few years they sell it off.
those lands are the property of the federal government, which it acts as an environmental steward over, why would it give up property to the states
it's appalling every time elliot state forest is brought up and used as an example of some sort of wrongdoing by the governing body. the forest was acquired by the state specifically to sell timber rights leases for school funding. when that forest became unprofitable and unmanageable, oregon's constitution required it's sale. now the state (with it's $1.8 billion dollar deficit) has to pull money out of somewhere so that this economic drain out in the middle of nowhere can stay relatively unused and unmanaged. everything about the elliott state forest has blown way out of proportion by oregon's politicians and oregon's media outlets. it is one of the poorest examples of the fight for/against public lands.
wait a minute. after having worked indirectly with cleveland cliffs and freeport mcmoran. i know for a fact we worked with and cooperated numerous times with state and federal geologist and surveyors. maybe my experiences are out of the norm. did you ever have any individual property owner or corporate owner refuse any request?
as a utahn that has actually worked on the bears issue, we want the public land transfer to happen. utah state land is much better managed than blm land, and there are no plans to make utah stop being an outdoors recreation state. they will not just sell t off to the highest bidder.
i'll probably be heading up there in two weeks or so, i'll snap a pic of what it looks like and email it out. thank you so much!
that sounds like you just implied you are just hitting on republicans.
ok so this is probably a dumb question but if the land is sold, where does the money go?
that's quite a bit misleading. donating to a cause, regardless of what it is, does not equal profit. (unless you consider the tax break for donating to a non-profit)
fair does, but doesn't continued federal ownership, without the possibility of sale i the event of their being interested parties who want to buy land, pretty much amount to the same?
i'm going to sound like a dick here but i feel like some of the other outdoor activities don't chip in their fare share.
oh if these lands belong to us all, you can just go ahead and walk on them... or... graze your cattle there, right? that surely wouldn't result in a 10 year legal saga culminating in a sit-in at your local blm and eventually result in your death in the snow at the hands of state troopers, right?
because the federal government was supposed to sell off the land to pay off the costs of establishing those states in the first place. that's how it worked until congress ended the sale of federal land in the 1970s.
last i checked, utah is still in the union. they're not a sovereign nation and are subject to the federal government just like every other state.
that's only supposed to cover territories, not land in states.
wrong answer. article 1, section 8, paragraph 17 lists all uses for land that congress (and therefore the federal government) may employ. the language you're quoting has ***nothing*** to do with acquiring land; "...property belonging to the united states..." is already defined in 1-8-17.
i don't really see the problem with them selling it.
because the states are what form the united states. they give, collectively, the federal government, some jurisdiction over certain inter-state (commerce, roads, mails, other state to state stuff) and international functions (treaties, borders, tariffs, other intl stuff). but the federal government isn't the united states. the states are. the land of each state belongs to each state. or it ought to i think. with the exception of some federal parks, perhaps.
i don't know the details. but it seems strange to call a forest an 'economic drain'. would you prefer that it was a desert?
we have lost access to mapping areas before. mostly it's to individuals. although i've heard corporations are hit and miss, as some do not wish to garner the risk of liability. at least, that's how it was explained to me.
i know you say that but i don't believe it. i'm sorry and you probably know a lot about the issue, but i just don't believe the utah state legislature. the gerrymandering in the state makes it so moderates and democrats have virtually no voice and i don't trust that the elected officials have anything on their mind except the next election and how to pay for it.
it would be a good idea to take a gps and get waypoints for each of your photo sites. then there would be solid evidence that you were where you thought you were, and that the land posted is definitely national forest.
hey, thanks for pointing that out. edited for clarity. i hit on tall/dark/handsome republicans and dems equally (kidding).
if state legislators could be trusted to manage it ethically, then it would.
people that don't live out west, don't understand the size of public lands, or states like montana for example. it should be left to the states not the federal government.
not an assumption. historically proven. before the passage of the taylor grazing act in 1934, roosevelt tried to give large tracts of federal land to the states. the governors of those states unanimously rejected the offer, saying the lands were worthless desert and would be to expensive to manage.
they absolutely have sovereignty. every state does. that's why there are different laws in washington than alabama. that's why colorado has legalized marijuana despite it being federally illegal.
it's cute that you can read, but context is everything. the problem arises when the land originally belonging to the states, such as grande staircase and bears ears, is summarily declared a national park or monument by the likes of bill clinton and barack obama. that's authority not given them by the constitution, but they've been good enough at stacking the courts to not have to worry about such trivial nonsense.
would you have issue with it if it was sold off for pennies on the dollar to the people / companies who backed the politician in office when they were sold off? how about to mining / logging companies who plan on just stripping the lands and polluting anything nearby? i don't have any personal issue with the government letting states sell that land. those are just my two worries.
these lands in question have never once been in the ownership of the states. the federal government bought or took these lands from mexico, then distributed them to people during the homestead act. homesteaders formed states but all the land that was never claimed in the west during the act has remained federal land.
hey, this is a great conversation about federal land grants. 70% of national land transferred to the states in the form of lands grants historically has been sold off. it does seem like states often don't have the budget to manage public land and keep it public. costs of managing public land are many, including firefighting, which is upwards of $3 billion dollars per year in the us these days.
the purpose of this land was very specific to it being profitable for the state of oregon, not recreation, not conservation, but very specifically tree farming. as it sits, it costs more money to maintain than it can generate in tourism or revenue, therefore in order to keep the land owned by the state, management resources must be pulled from somewhere else, only there is nowhere to pull that money from. the state is basically going to have to pay maintenance on an unused tree farm, which it cannot afford, hence it being an economic drain. even if it were a desert, it would cost the state money to manage it.
why can't they just build a solar farm there and call it a day
that's good. i always feel like i'm only getting half the story when a show/documentary mostly just goes after one side of the isle.
there's your true owner, the government (not the people) own the land. if you own something and you can't sell it, you don't really own it.
the state is much easier to hold accountable. if you don't like your local legislation, you actually have the power to change it.
an idahoan seconding /u/tacotruck7: federal management isn't a problem, except for a few who aren't able to understand and appreciate collective ownership by the nation, vs a locality. additionally, 90% of the daily management of your public lands occurs at the hands of local employees who work to balance the needs of the communities with the interests of the nation. it's a very tough job, and they get a lot of undeserved criticism.
that issue is actually much debated - states definitely have rights, as enumerated in the constitution, but sovereignty has a very specific meaning and its never been fully fleshed out by the supreme court, or otherwise, in the context of states in america (vs. nation states, which definitely have sovereignty). and it's not why state's have different laws, that's a matter of state's retaining police powers and various other powers to regulate within their boundaries. and fwiw - supreme court hasn't ruled on many facets of state vs. federal authority to legalize drugs either.
i don't disagree, which is why i stated that my objection is to the *extent* of federal land ownership, and not the ownership itself.
and this is somehow better if it happens at a federal level where the only way for a company to make productive use of a piece of land is to lobby the government to reimburse them for the fees for using it? you haven't placed the land out of the reach of corruption, you've placed the people who are corrupt out of the reach of the people who have to live with the consequences.
understood. so why is this a reason for the fed to keep holding them? just because they've always owned them is not a reason for them to keep them. why shouldn't they now give them to the states?
i don't know much about the industry, but has there been a value associated with other benefits that forest might bring? (e.g ecosystem services, water basin recharge, erosion control, etc).
what are the cost associated with this? i don't know much about logging so i don't understand why they can't just leave the land alone for awhile.
as unpopular as it is, the state could start charging tax on goods, which they don't do currently. i was surprised to learn that oregon residents don't even need to pay tax in states like washington either. coming from the midwest, it's very odd to see from my perspective. if the state is that bad at managing it's budget though, then money has to come from somewhere.
a farm is also meant to be profitable. but a good farmer knows to rotate his crops. don't be mad at the farm, be mad at the farmer (in this analogy, the bad farmer is the state of oregon).
why does managing of a forest (or a desert) cost money? i mean, it's a piece of land, just let it sit there and do nothing.
why not just not manage it... let it grow wild. the land did just fine for millions of years before people got involved.
ownership in most common law nations is based on the concept of *fee simple*, in which the state maintains ownership of all lands under its domain, and grants stewardship rights to private citizens. so, it may have seemed snarky, but it's true, you don't actually own any real-property, the state does, and merely grants you exclusive stewardship.
they tend to be more homogeneous in their political views. you are also a state. not a separate country. just because you think it's ok to slash and burn millions of acres of forest land doesn't mean the the rest of the country shouldn't have a say. it is also cheaper and easier to corrupt state officials due to their relative lack of power and penchant to search for short term benefits to secure their reelection. so what's better? your state making some small financial gains that will not benefit the greater country, or keeping some wilderness beauty. easily the latter. have you not watched fern gully??
ranchers discovered it was a far better deal to lease the land for a few cents/acre/year than it would be to buy the land and have to pay property taxes on it. mccarran made this even more lucrative for the ranchers by making banks take a rancher's leased properties as collateral for loans. this made it so the banks had an incentive to keep the ranchers in business and prop them up in lean times. then mccarran took away the budget of the grazing service so they could not afford to enforce the limits on head count, and they could barely even afford the staff to collect the grazing fees. essentially the ranchers got complete control of the rangelands for a pittance of what it would have cost to buy them. more recent administrations have given the federal agencies who control the land more power. this has really pissed off the ranchers who had everything just how they liked it....
but as it stands, the lands can't be sold. so yes it is better at a federal level, as the selling of these lands at a federal level cannot happen.
because the fed has a self imposed stewardship responsibility that the states would not fulfill also these lands can make for semi-useful bargaining chips lastly why give something up when there isn't a compelling cause to do so
maybe an old-growth forest, but these forests are specifically planted for harvest. the trees are planted closely together, and require maintenance for them to properly mature (an unkempt forest is also a greater fire hazard). foresters also seek the benefits of sustainability, as they want to be able to replant forests and make more money in the future. think farming, but on a much, much longer cycle. i grew up in sw washington, and many people buy 40 acres of land, or whatever, as a long term family investment they expect to keep in the family for generation, it's not like the stripping of resources it can be made our to be.
value is only measured through capital gains. duh.
i wonder if he's using the modern conservative form of the term "cost", which is essentially the same as "not generating revenue." even if something costs $0 to maintain, but could generate at least $0.01 in revenue by selling it off, then it's now a "cost." the cold, hard figures in $$ are the only thing going into such an equation. preserve nature by leaving it untouched? naw, that's too "costly".
because you cannot take people out of the equation. even wilderness areas require protection from illegal/damaging activities, that costs money.
not even exclusive stewardship, as far as i am aware americans and foreigners can visit us national parks equally for the same entrance fee and conditions.
i don't see why it's so great that the land can't be sold. it's completely worthless until someone does something with it. this insistence that it's owned by everyone doesn't change that.
drought isn't the only indicator of a bad fire season, in fact a fair amount of moisture (like we've definitely had this winter) is necessary to grow the grass. if we're lucky, the record snowfall will mean we have a fair amount of moisture stick around, but what's more likely is that we'll dry out in august and all that new grass will burn like the dickens.
please... elliot state forest is not a tree farm. treating our public forests like they're nothing more than tree farms is a big part of the problem. it makes me sick. q_q
that is easy to say that for the upvotes, but its extremely ignorant. we're talking about an asset that is being maintained for economic production. that is its sole purpose. therefor, its profit is the primary metric that we are concerned about. when we talk about a national park, its primary goal isn't economic and therefor its profitability isn't a useful metric to track. when we talk about a factory, its primary goal isn't beauty so we don't track that metric either. when we're talking about a sales person, do you think the company really tracks how many calories he eats during the day ?
they don't require protection... giving protection is a choice, and you can choose not to do it.
last year the outdoor industry generated $646 billion dollars. so while you can't tie a dollar directly to each acre of land, to say the land is worthless is just incorrect. as an aside and a personal belief of mine, just because a piece of land isn't generating money doesn't make it worthless. the vast pieces of land that i have hunted, fished, camped, and used for my personal pleasure may have never been used for a strip mine or a walmart, but i wouldn't consider them worthless. and the cool thing is, you can use them just as much as i can because they currently reside in the public domain. i think that is very worthwhile, and it is reassuring to me to know that we have this land that is open to anyone to use.
but that argument accepts as given that it's perfectly acceptable to view a forest solely in profit/loss terms. i disagree with that entirely.

how much rowing dod you do in prep for the journey?
were you both conscious of the "personal time" a human needs when at sea for 58 days? did you accommodate for that or just ignore it?
1. how did decide when was the best time to leave? 2. how long did you estimate that it would take? 3. was there any romantic activity between you and george on the trip and if either of you were not single, how did your s.o. feel about you being in a boat with someone else? 4. what was the plan in case something horrible happened? 5. how much weight did you lose by the time you were done? 6. were you noticeably stronger after rowing for ~60 straight days? 7. how'd you poop and pee and what'd you do with the toilet paper?

man i hate even swimming in the ocean where i can't see whats around me, and you manage to travel across an entire sea! how were you okay with the fact that you're in this small boat with hundred of miles of sea under you? that seems terrifying.
i have a couple of questions. looking through the pictures, it looks like neither of you lost much weight (not that there was much weight to lose in the first place). was this due to a lack of exercising that you could do? also, did you guys end up having any sex during the row?
oh my god! i never even thought that's possible! amazing and congratulations! why? :)
did you arrive in antigua? seems like antigua is the place. there was 3 or 4 that just did the same thing in the last couple of years (trying to break the record for time).
why did you choose a 3 hour on and 3 hour off shift? was there a reason behind not choosing a longer shift?
i didn't even know this was a thing that people did. what is the history of this type of endeavour? also, go big red!
i know george's dad. he was the judge who married me. my question is: what's up?

did you ever get bored? what'd you do to pass time? how did you manage 58 days without a shower didn't you get all rashy? i know i do if i go like 3-4 days without a shower much less 58.
1) how did you guys stay clean? was it even an issue? 2) watching your video, seems like dryness was an issue, any recommendations in hind-sight? 3) could your average in shape person do this? 4) would it be possible to do an 8 hr on 8 hr off shift? 5) have you ever done a long backpacking trip? how would this compare to doing say a week long 100 mile 30k elevation gain trip in terms of daily effort? obviously a lot longer, but i hope my question is at least somewhat clear?

i read about some of the snacks you brought on board...did you guys make sure your freeze dried meals had efficient calories for that kind of exercise? what about salts to retain water, macronutrients? was that tracked or thought about very much? did you lose weight during the journey? thanks!
how did you get involved in something like this? i rowed in college, but crossing an ocean is another thing entirely.
did your journey involve crying? i just watched a documentary on 4 women who rowed the pacific. there was crying.
did you get enough food? how/what did you eat to get enough energy? remember seeing someone doing this in the pacific and they got burgers flown in by helicopter near the end
were you the first boat to finish the race? if not, then how long did it take the winners to finish? did everyone finish the race?
how did you achieve sleep on the crossing? did one of you sleep while the other rowed or kept watch for some weather issue that would need both of you awake and alert? or did you sleep at the same time? seems dangerous, but i'm completely out of my element on this one. i start panicking when i lose sight of land, so this achievement of yours is, in my mind, someone performing the completely impossible. congratulations to you both!!
did you see any cool animals on your trip? any sharks or scary moments?
how often do you talk about your rowing trip at bars and parties and people don't believe you so you have to show them the proof you showed us redditors?
what did you 2 forget on shore that you had room for and would have been helpful or enjoyable to have onboard for the trip?
we saw a bunch of fish that i had no idea what they were! we also saw some whales. the first time we saw a whale we rowed in circles for half a day trying to follow it and get a picture.
it is absolutely the most amazing thing you can ever see. the stars were so bright and numerous that i would just stare until my neck started to hurt. we also rowed through bio-luminescent plankton which was mindbogglingly beautiful.
i crossed the atlantic a few times in the navy on a surface ship. even with the little bit of light pollution from the ship, the night sky was one of the most amazing things i've ever experienced. so many stars visible that it's almost too much to comprehend.
it was not fun..i did try to swim after each shift so i could at least get some of the sweat off! i also washed my clothes a couple times a week with freshwater so they wouldn't get crunchy. the first shower on land was pretty amazing!
in a bucket. it wasn't the most fun but it worked!
when we found out the storm was coming we tried to row as far south as possible to miss the worst of it. once the wind was strong enough in the wrong direction that we were not making any progress we deployed our sea anchor. a sea anchor, or para anchor, is basically a parachute with a hole in the top. you put it out in the water and it hovers ~50-75 ft away from you below the surface. it keeps you perpendicular with the waves so you are less likely to roll and it also slows down your drift. once we did that we hunkered down in the cabins until the storm passed!
the hardest part was when we got caught in weird currents and would row as hard as we could and get pushed backwards. it happened when we were only about 400 miles from the finish line! we were so close to being done but we just couldn't move! we had one tropical storm hit us that turned into a hurricane! it was scary not having weather radar because we really didn't know what to expect. we had a satellite phone so people gave us weather updates but we really just had to wait and see what happened. it ended up not being that bad but it was a little scary.
i actually planned a head of time and started taking my birth control continuously so i would not have to deal with that!
our boat had 2 emergency epirbs and our lift raft had 1. the race made sure that we had all of the safety equipment and training we needed!
not really..we did see a lot of floating garbage which was sad.
honestly i don't think it really sunk in until we lost sight of land. that was when it finally felt real. then we just kept rowing until we saw land again! there were some times that rowing got really tough and i just wanted to be done. we hit a weird current that was pushing us back east and we would row for 24 hours and stay in the same spot or lose a couple of miles. it was really frustrating!
two questions/comments: ***background: i was a college big ten club level rower from a big ten school and farming state just like you 1) what the hell were your hands like after two months of that nonsense? (bonus points for photos). aside from that, biggest health limitations or discomfort? 2) i was interested in opening your link and seeing you were from luverne. i have a good friend i went to college with from nw iowa who ended up in luverne. small town city i haven't heard of in a long time; if you need a tax lawyer for these sponsorship deals i can gladly hook you up.
since it was a race there is a sailboat that tries to sail around the entire fleet in case someone needs help. luckily we never needed any help. if you get assistance of any kind you are disqualified from the race. i didn't think i was weird after the row but my family and friends said i was really spacey. they said it was hard to carry on a conversation with me because i would just start daydreaming.
we rowed 3 hours on 3 hours off. so one was rowing while the other was sleeping. basically you would just wake up, get dressed, eat something, start rowing, finish rowing, change your clothes, eat something, sleep, and repeat. i did have to run the water maker every day around noon to make our fresh water for drinking. we mostly ate freeze dried meals and a lot of costco bulk snacks!
whales, fish, dolphins, no sharks (thankfully) i think i would have been too scared to swim if we had seen sharks.
thank you! i really appreciate it. the race organizers had a "first meal" set up when we got back and it was a burger and fries!
we had a very complex garmin system called nmea 2000. this included our gps, ais (which pings our location show we show up on other ships radar), wind/weather info, and navigation. we used the gps a lot in the beginning because there were several small islands close to the one we started on and we wanted to make sure we didn't get to close. after that..we pretty much rowed west/southwest and went with the wind. if our electronics had failed we did have a handheld gps that we could have used for navigation but it would have been very dangerous to be out there without an ais. since our boat was so small the big cargo ships could hardly see us. if we didn't show up on their radar there is a good chance we could have been hit.
haha a little bit! i was overall just very tired when i got back. i kept want to nap like every three hours.
i don't feel like i was spacey but i do remember feeling overwhelmed by all of the noise.
wow that is really embarrassing! i don't think i can change it either. whoops. i guess i was nervous and typing fast. it was weird being in a tiny boat but i think we got so used to it. then when i watched some footage of our boat in the water it looked like a tiny toy!
so this is kind of embarrassing but we both had really weird songs that we loved. i was a big fan of celine dion's "that's the way it is", "jack sparrow" by lonely island, and "we didn't start the fire" by billy joel.
besides food we had our clothes which consisted of spandex shorts mostly, underwear, i mostly rowed in my sports bra or swim top, we brought goggles, cleaning gear for the boat, a pretty extensive med kit, ipods, pictures from home, santa hats for christmas, lots of sunscreen, and a couple gopros!
i rowed for 3 years in college on a club team so i had some experience. we did the row as part of a race and a lot of the people on other teams had never rowed a boat before in their lives! there was definitely a wide range of people from hard core athletes to every day people and everyone ended up making it across!
we kind of had our personal time during our rest hours when the other person was rowing. we never really got sick of each other because we didn't actually see each other that much!
1. the race takes place in december-february because this is the time with the least hurricanes. 2. our goal was to finish in under 60 days. we made it in 58. 3. we had emergency beacons, a satellite phone, and a lift raft if shit really hit the fan. maritime law would be our friend..any boat that is able to respond to a distress call has to. 4. i lost 20 lbs. i had put on a lot of weight because people scared me and told me i would look like i was starved. i probably didn't need to put on as much as i did. 5. definitely! my back was so strong. 6. we had a bucket for our toilet. we used biodegradable wipes for tp.
the deepest known point in the ocean is a bit over 6 miles.
we both put on way to much weight before the race! people made us nervous that we would lose like 50+ pounds. girls on average lose only about 10lbs..the guys lose quite a bit more! no naughty time was had. we have always been just friends!
yes! we arrived in nelson's dockyard/english harbor. it is the finish line for the race now so every year there will be a whole fleet going in!
we tried to do 2 hrs on 2 hrs off but realized it was not enough sleeping time. we both felt pretty comfortable rowing for another hour and thought it was worth it to get that extra hour of sleep. i do think we lost a little bit of productivity in that third hour but since we weren't concerned about racing it worked out.
we had a pretty uneventful row in terms of equipment failure, weather, or injuries; which is definitely a good thing! i think one of the worst things that happened was we had downloaded a bunch of playlists of spotify so they would be available offline without wifi..and about 30 days in all of the sudden they were unavailable! luckily i about 20 songs and my audio books left..but rowing 12 hours a day..20 songs is not a lot! the next row i want to outfit the boat with better cameras! i feel like we missed filming a lot of cool stuff because we didn't take time to set the cameras up. i also would bring fruity candy! i surprisingly got sick of chocolate and probably would have killed for some starbursts or skittles.
because we decided to go with a new boat i would estimate about $200k. used boats are much cheaper..~$10-20k. the race fee is also expensive about $30k. the other big expense is shipping the boat to the start line and back home. we had some sponsors, some very generous donors, and did a few fundraisers.
i flew home with my family from antigua to minnesota (it was freezing). it was a very strange feeling. the finish was amazing! but we had spent almost the last 3 years of our lives planning this journey. every spare moment was dedicated to it and then all of the sudden it was just over. the first few months back home were pretty tough for me. i really felt kind of empty and not sure what i wanted to do with my life!
we went by 5500 calories per day. we also had some hydration tablets that we put in our water. i think if i do more of these i would definitely meet with a nutritionist. i did notice that my pee was very neon green and my nails got very weak. i lost about 15-20 pounds on the trip!
the cabin was small but not too cramped. i could sit up straight and stretch out all the way. the worst part was that it was so humid..i hate being hot so this was tough for me.
no we weren't, we were about in the middle of the pack. we decided we were not as concerned about racing and just wanted to enjoy the experience! the first place team finished in 35 days and last place was 96! everyone made it and we were actually the first fleet to have all boats finish!
sounds like an amazing experience. after reading about the hurricane i'm glad to hear y'all made it out alright!
how far off the shore would you say the sky is without light pollution? i've always wanted to do this although i'll never own my own boat. i imagine it was even more breathtaking during the new moon.
can you tell us more about the plankton? sounds hella interesting.
exactly! it's so hard to explain. i've also been to some really remote wilderness areas but this was a whole different level.
didn't you get that itchy salty feeling putting clothes back on?
how did it feel to swim so far out in the open ocean like that. i've never done it, and i can't imagine swimming with miles of water below me.
how did customs/passports work going to a different country by sea like that? did you have to register with customs across the ocean when you got there?
this is unbelievable. how confident were you in the boat? was it tested enough for situations like that? good lord.
thanks for the reply! i get nervous driving through storms on the highway, i can't imagine doing what y'all did
"only about 400 miles from the finish line" the word only here really puts some perspective on the size of this race.
are there any side effects of doing that afterwards?
epirb = emergency position indicating radio beacon. question; why not a sepirb? also, thank you for showing people just how strong we actually are. you and your friend are a beacon of inspiration and motivation. i wish i could hug the both of you.
there's your sponsor. document the garbage you see and supply footage for funding for environmental companies?
let me just tell you that i'm a 47 year old dude who doesn't know how to swim, so i look at your achievement as something akin to the moonshot. i'm incredibly impressed that somebody ever thought "know what? i can do that." and then actually did.
1. our hands were surprisingly ok! i think we rowed enough on the ergs that we had good calluses. they did have a lot of dead skin and were very sore but no blisters at least! there is a picture of my hands in the video diary video! 2. that's awesome! i love how it is such a small world. i will definitely keep that in mind as i work toward more sponsors. thank you!
wow! that's a big pile of supplies. just out of curiosity, how many calories and how many cups of fresh water did you guys consume per day? and what kind of stuff did you eat?
ahh, how was it adjusting to that level of sleep?i'm also assuming the ocean isn't the nicest place to lay down
what was involved in "running the water maker"? did you row to make fresh water? what kind of water maker was it?
so were you rowing alone most of the time? i assume once your friend finished their shift they'd fall right asleep!
what were the freeze dried meals like? did you cook them yourself? what was the inside of the cabin like?
you swam?..that's crazy. i couldn't imagine more surreal moments then swimming in the open ocean.
did you get sick eating those types of foods after going so long without it?
thank you for using the ais. i'm a ship captain and it's hard to pick up small boats on just radar, especially in rough weather and/or with fiberglass hulls.
did you think about rowing with your legs and feet?
all good, i'm only teasing. i honestly didn't realise it was even possible to row across the atlantic until 5 minutes ago - what an adventure!
honestly i'm more surprised that you chose a celine dion song other than "my heart will go on". nice playlist though
did the nights ever get super cold or really hot?
i wonder, what would happen if you encountered a distress call? would there be enough supplies and room for another passenger or two in an emergency?
thanks for answering! reading your story stokes my desire to do a long distance hike. i am good at walking. i am good at not falling. and... i already have 'strategic' calorie reserves so it would take me longer to starve to death.
lol.. yup we were there for the finish this year. we live on a boat in caribbean and spend a bunch of time in antigua. it was very cool to look at the boats though. i thought we were crazy crossing oceans on our little catamaran.. nope, you guys are way more crazy.
a nutritionist sounds like a great idea. i've paddled some long distance outrigger canoe races (a measly 40 miles or so) and i ate poi as much as possible. sounds like a blast, you've inspired me! thanks!
oh my. what happened to the 96 day crew? was anyone disqualified?
hmm.. i'm not sure about that one.. we rowed for about 2 days before we finally lost site of land.
kind of a funny story.. both george and i had seen this "glowing stuff" in the water for a couple nights but both of us thought we were just losing our minds. finally one of us said something. it was so cool though! when we would take a stroke and the water ran off our oars it looked like little gems falling down. then the oars would make the water swirl and a huge cloud of the blue/green would come up. i tried so hard to get it on camera but it didn't work.
yes! we tried to rinse our clothes with fresh water frequently because they got really crusty. i also would try to do kind of a sponge bath with fresh water after each shift.
we had to go through customs in antigua. i think the race organizers kind of worked out a deal with them. we didn't have to go immediately.
i loved our boat! i never once felt unsafe. the company that built her did an amazing job. we didn't have a single equipment problem on the entire journey which is basically unheard of. before the race the boat had to be flipped over in the water to make sure it was water tight and also to make sure that it self righted.
i think i mostly slept through the storm! it was about the second week of rowing and we were so exhausted. it ended up being a nice break!
yeah..it seems crazy! once we got to 999 even..just losing that 1 digit helped so much.
nah not really. it might be a little heavier the next time you have one, but i've never really noticed a difference. in the months leading up to my wedding i realized i was scheduled to start on my actual wedding day and then it would have continued halfway through my honeymoon! i wasn't having that so i manipulated the way i took the pills so that my period came the week before my wedding.
we saw a few tires, and random stuff that maybe looked like plastic bags? it was hard to tell.
better! i actually watched a youtube video about four guys that did it. it was so inspiring and looked like an amazing adventure. i just decided then and there and i wanted to do it!
there was a 67 year old dude that did the row! i'm sure there have people that have done it that are afraid of water as well. it definitely was a bucket list thing to start with but i fell in love with it and want to do more!
it's amazing to me that you can still say it's a small world after rowing that far!
we tried to get 5500 cal per day. we had 3 freeze dried meals each per day along with a bag of snacks that had a variety of things in it..granola bars, trail mix, chocolate.. etc. i think i drank 3 of my camel baks every 12 hours.. so 6 liters. we drank a lot! i don't think i ever stopped sweating.
quite a few cargo ships! we also saw one sailboat from france. they circled us a few times and talked to us. i think they were confused as to why we were in this tiny boat and were concerned that we needed help.
you aren't going to believe this..but neither of us were big caffeine drinkers..i think the most caffeine we had on board was in the chocolate.
arctic, southern, and pacific are the three real tough ones!
the nights did get a little chilly! it was also that nasty wet/cold too. i had a light blanket that i brought with and usually would row in a long sleeve shirt at night.
at the university of nebraska! it was just a small club team not ncaa but we had a lot of fun.
the us has some great long distance trails for something like that!
isn't the horizon approximately 5 miles on sea? jesus.
you might have already answered this, but how did you have enough fresh water for the entire trip?
did you use suntan lotion? if so, how much did you guys end up using?
upvote for my country lol. all jokes aside, i think i remember seeing something about this in the antiguan news. when i get access to my computer, i will see if i can find the article.
that is truly amazing. amazing accomplishment. congrats.
what was the total length? did you have anything for entertainment besides rowing?
thank you! follow up question... how do i find joy in anything?
depending on how that 'meeting' actually played out, i can imagine it being quite enjoyable. meeting some french people and explaining that you're rowing across an ocean. i wouldn't think that you planned on meeting anyone in the middle of nowhere. do you speak french? or did they speak english? it might have been quite funny as well if there was a language barrier.
i think they're saying redbull would sponsor it...they probably would.
what does rowing across the southern ocean even mean? would you circle around the entirety of antarctica? also, for the arctic would you go from iceland to alaska or some similar route? would any issues arise from being in russian waters?
i also find it crazy how you guys had 3 hour shifts it take me an hour aline just to fall asleep. well for you guys after doing all that rowing i'm sure you guys met the sandman within 5 minutes? were there any nights where you were restless when it was time to sleep?
never been to nebraska. is there that many lakes and ponds out there in and around lincoln nebraska?
i could probably manage the at if i went southbound. however, my job has me working long construction hours during may-october. i've looked into either at or something below 40n latitude. unfortunately my wife tore her acl a month ago, so it probably won't happen this year.
that's the plan! just have to get some sponsors on board.
you can see land for a long way out if it's clear! taking the ferry from nb to ns, i can pretty easily see all the way across the bay of fundy, which is some 75km. granted, they could've rowed quite a bit further than that in 2 full days, i imagine.
so we had to bring an emergency supply which also acted as ballast weight. this was bottled water that was stored in the lowest part of the boat. then for every day use we had a desalination machine that made fresh water.
thank you! if you are interested there is an amazing documentary on netflix called losing sight of shore. it's not me..but it is about 4 amazing girls that row the pacific ocean.
just over 3,000 miles. we had music and some audio books!
my advice: get a dog..or a cat. coming home to my dog being so excited to see me is the only thing that gets me through the work week!
thank you! that was my goal for the trip..when i came back i wanted to inspire even just one person to do something that scared them.
i could see this becoming a movie. "dou you naeed heulp?" "no, thank you! we're just rowing across the atlantic." "pardon?" "i said, we're rowing across the atlantic!" (quietly) "n'importe quoi..."
i tried talking with them before the first one and they said they would give me a few cases of redbull to take with. i haven't tried again since i got back but i probably should!
route planning has not taken place yet! but those are great questions that i will need to figure out..
it is choppy, but the boat just rolls over the waves. i never once felt us close to tipping over or flipping. as long as you are smart it can be a very safe journey.
i haven't done it before! i honestly didn't know that exited outside of more 'tropical' places until a couple months back. also it's awesome your boat was from pt. townsend! i'm from seattle and love seeing local companies excelling.
holy cow the pacific is massive and anything but pacific. also how did you get food out there?
after you do something extrodinary or tough it's nice being home for a while, but then it just feels kind of empty, at least from my experience. any other plans in the works? flight around the world isn't as impressive but man would that be a trip. i think that would be fun. getting a license and a small cessna and just leaving.
how hard was adjusting to the 9-5 grind after that?
yeah i think having actually done it would give you enough credibility for a larger investment lol
awesome! i worked in seattle on a yacht for a few months. it is a great city!
depends on the process, but in the navy some boats use evaporators. it's the purest water i've ever had. i really liked it. if the boat has a reverse osmosis machine, it was a chemical taste.
we had to bring all of our food with us! 70 days worth.
i completely get this. it wears off over time, maybe that's just complacency, but it's an odd thing coming home (a safe, comfortable familiar place) and feeling like what you said. i often think of the hobbits in lotr after they did all the amazing things and come back to the shire to have that emptiness.
i am still trying to adjust! most days i sit and stare out my office window thinking about the ocean...
you wrote the same comment three times. it's a sign that your wife would really be pissed off at you.
i thought that too! a lot of companies that i have been in touch with since the row still just think i'm crazy. maybe i'm doing it wrong.
i've been kicking myself because a sailing company was looking for a receptionist position here, which i do, and they would teach sailing skills. i didn't apply, i wish i did though. bummer :(
you should check out dogspotting society on facebook. your pup would be a hit! :)
if i looked into the ocean and saw all blue i would be fucking terrified, the very thought makes anxious.
you are an amazing role model, patti! i love it when you and your peers pop up on letsrun to offer wisdom and commentary. do you think track & field "needs" to be more popular as a spectator sport?
i'm glad i read your story, it's amazing how it all started with wanting to "be nice to yourself". so many of us, especially as young girls, we are often pressured to be a certain way, because of society, that we get to stuck in what others want from us. you broke through that, and it's so inspiring!, and incredible. it reminded me that it's been years since i've been really nice to myself, and then i stop. being over weight i know it's something i need to be healthier over all but it's sooo incredibly hard, and even embarrassing to go workout at the gym, thinking, how did i get this far?. anyways, it was delightful, and motivating to know of you mrs.patti, may you you be an empowerment for women/girls always!.
first, i would like to thank you for helping pave the way in women's athletics. i just started running about three years ago and have been nothing but supported by my friends, family, and the running community, and i feel very thankful that i didn't have to face the same kind of challenges to competing that you and other leading women did. second, i was wondering how many years it took you to build up to 120 mpw. obviously at seven miles for your first run, you've got a solid head start on most of the population. did you jump pretty quickly into the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and then take a longer time to build up from there or did you find yourself well-suited to high mileage very early on? if you ever find yourself on reddit again, we'd love to have you hang out with us over at /r/advancedrunning!
what tribe are you from? do you ever go to reservations and speak to the children/people? i think this is so inspiring. we have a womens running group on my reservation and we participate in many runs. from 5ks-100 milers.
through your years of competition and training what injuries would you say are most common? i know that many people warn about knee issues but i never really hear many athletes themselves complain about knee problems.
you wrote that you are restarting your career. what did you do in the years between your running glory and now?
when you started the be nice to patti campaign, how did you go about setting personal boundaries and not giving in to those, especially in personal and professional relationships?
would you rather have prefontaine's flowing locks or mills's buzz cut?
great write up for the introduction! at the end you said you're restarting your career. does that mean your running career? if yes, is there anywhere you post online as to how you are progressing, that i can follow and keep track of? all the best!
hello! you seem a wonderful person! i'm not a runner (i play tennis though) and i really admire what you do! i can't run half an hour whithout feeling dead, lol. my questions are 1)what advice would you give to a young athlete? 2)which books would you recommend? (not related to running, sorry) 3)how do you deal with exhaustion? it's a huge problem for me. thank you very much for this ama! love from italy!
what do you think is missing for female athletes when it comes to care from doctors, trainers etc? i've noticed that most is focused towards a male genetic make up and female athletes are mostly left to fill in the gaps for how their system works. how did you account for that in your training and self care?
how do you feel pregnancy impacts women's ability to sustain top class performance? i've read some articles suggesting it can actually improve performance post-pregnancy.
i seem to be having a problem getting back into running. when i was in my 20s i ran 5km a day no problem. now every time i go to run my smoke seems to go out and i have to stop and relight it every 100m. do you have any advice?
what do you think about during long runs? does your mind just kind of empty and you go through the motions?
i love your story and it really inspired me as somebody who's intro to running was similar to yours. at what point did you decide to start training for races? did something or somebody inspire you to start racing, or was it more of a spontaneous decision?
i always get shin splints about a mile into every run, any tips on avoiding/reducing shin splints? should i keep running/stretch it out or just stop and try and go farther before next my run.
hey! thanks for doing this and all you do, and a lot of these questions are great, but here's a fun one! what's your guilty pleasure food?
this is great! thanks for doing this! i used to run around quincy a lot, mostly by the water (i would pass the old beachcomber), and had a nice 10k loop. my question is: do you wish you had the chance for the olympics in 1980? i don't think they had the women's marathon until 1984 and there was the boycott in 1980, but maybe you could have made it in the 10k? did you try at all for the '84 team?
what do you think about on long runs? do you daydream? fantasize about something? where does your mind go or do you experience a sort of 'highway hypnosis' during a long run?
i just started running a month ago. i see the future runner me as going fast and long. do you have any tips you'd give me right from the start?
hi patti! thanks for your contributions to sports and getting women more involved in athletics. what's your favorite fruit?
this is awesome. you are awesome! i've been having excellent strength progress on my powerbuilding program but i want to run well too and i'm including running goals on my plan today!!! what were some of your first running goals regarding distance and time? i think i will focus more on speed than resistance to use the advantage i have right now and build upon it. thank you so much for your story!
what's your experience with doping? did you do it? observe it? did you see anyone that was a really weak runner turn into an amazing one?
this is such an amazing story patti! i am so inspired! i myself recently started running and training for a half marathon when i previously couldn't even do a mile at the beginning of the year. now i can run up to 8 miles and will be doing my first half at the end of june! what are some tips that you have for your speed? and also, how do you motivate yourself to run when you feel tired, sick, or just down? sometimes after work, i'm very tired and can't bring myself to do anything.
how does it feel to have to add the "for a woman" or "for a minority" qualifier to all of your achievements?
did you ever use recovery techniques like aqua jogging? how effective did you find them? asking for a friend...
i'm struggling through a big mental block right now. do you have any tips on how to stay on track?
hi! i get winded and tired so easily when i run. how do you build endurance?
do you still like baseball nut? i like it as a shake, myself.
hey thanks probably late but, did you hear haskell closed the track program ?
maybe i'm late, but i've gotta know - how many pairs of shoes have you gone through? how many miles would you wear a pair before replacing them? your post was definitely inspirational. i've never been a great runner after a couple knee injuries/surgeries, but i feel like i should start again and try to knock a few pounds off.
something potentially off topic but i'm part mi'kmaq as well, grew up in halifax, i was wondering where you're mother was from in ns?
you're probably never going to see this, but i wanted to say that your story is so freaking inspiring. also we have the same birthday, are the same height, and i've also been enrolled at quincy college! i've just been wanting to knock my 5k under 20 minutes and qualify for boston...maybe i'll set bigger goals for myself! how did you avoid getting injured during your quick rise to an elite level?
hi patti, what "american indian" tribe are you from? i heard you mom is from a tribe in nova scotia, first nations micmac and your dads 2nd generation irish. maybe you meant native north american?
how does it feel to answer all of these questions? what kind of questions are the best in your opinion?
kiwi are amazing! they're my favorite fruit, do you eat the skin or do you peel/bowl the fruit?
uh, you're white. not native american. stop culturally appropriating?
have a goal! stick to it. even if that goal is just running a mile a day...but dream bigger. if i could do it over again, i would have dreamed bigger.
thank you so much! i enjoy letsrun. rojo and wejo have done a great service and made a wonderful resource for runners. oh, yeah! i would love to see people like jordan hasay and allie ostrander get more attention, i'd love to meet them and watch their meets. i think it should be more of a spectator sport. i love watching running, i don't know why people don't like watching track and field...people just don't get it, i guess.
i am mi'kmaq, my tribe is in maine and nova scotia! my kids are mi'kaq and chickasaw. i just recently was in santa fe speaking at the w.i.n.g.'s of america coaches conference, at the american institute for indian arts. i love to go to reservations and talk to an encourage kids. i've been traveling since my daughters was 8 weeks old, she went to her first reservation in bemidji, minnesota, we went to red lake. i'm so glad you have a group!! 100 milers...wow! that's so awesome. it's so necessary for our communities to be active. i carry diabetes and heart disease in my family, it's such an issue...we need to be proactive.
hmmm...good question...i am a toe-striker when i run, so i had a lot of foot and lower leg problems. achilles and plantar fasciitis were common with a lot of the people i ran with. i struggled with that, too. shin splints...my hubby had a stress fracture in his navicular bone that he had for ten years. those are pretty common as well.
a lot...i married my husband danny 25 years ago, we raised two kids. before that i had my own store...owned a restaurant. i skiied. i was a massage therapist and a nutritionist...i worked as a nanny for a wonderful family. lots of stories, lol! but the past few years were being a stay at home mom and proudly homeschooling two kids.
i didn't listen to music until my daughter helped me with spotify...lol! she made me a playlist. i listen to the beach boys...queen..."we are the champions" was my song back in '80 and '81, i still listen to it today. i also play pokemon go a lot, and the background music is pretty fun to run to. (i like to hatch eggs while i run...wilson loves the music, he gets so excited whenever he hears it.)
(in the 90's? ya think? lol!) welllllll, i just saw wonder woman with my daughter, and so right now, i think all things are possible! when i was running, they said women couldn't even do under 2:20 in the marathon, and look what we have today. i think it's definitely possible. it'll just take someone who dreams bigger and trains harder.
i didn't, really. i ran with a group of guys. i've run with a group of guys. i just trained like a marathon runner, a long distance runner, not like a woman. but...there are differences. women are still behind in heart care. a paramedic would probably think i'm a corpse, i have a resting heart rate of 43. but ultimately it's individualized, its hard to speak for all women on this subject.
try changing your shoes. it sounds like you need to change them. shin splints are usually caused by tight calves and toestriking...i'm a toestriker. i would stretch before you run, especially your calves. try dropping your heel on a step, 30 seconds, 10 reps each leg. flexible shoes are key.
that's so great! i used to go in front of the y, all the way down wallaston beach, to the squatum guard shack. sometimes i'd go out and do the bridge, out and back. the police had their fire range out there, i think. they didn't have my event in '80, so i didn't even have the olympics on my radar...i knew my distance, and i knew i was a marathoner. and yes, i did try for the '84 team, i got 16th at the trials--to me, i just wanted to be on the line, i was tickled that i got to the trials themselves. i don't have any regrets. i wasn't raised with the olympic attitude...everything i did in my career, i did to try and recapture that feeling i had in the locker room shower of the y.
lol! i never did. other people did that for me. i always just accomplished things for me. i was very goal-oriented, and what other people said or thought about me didn't matter. my times were my times, and i stand by them, it didn't matter what gender i was or what ethnicity. they were good no matter what.
goals. goals. goals. little goals, stepping stone goals are important, i find. at times the long term goals make for being overwhelmed. and fear can set in . believe your goal. doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about it. it's yours to make. it's yours to own. it's yours to work towards. when the time comes, you may not reach the long term goal..but it won't matter because you did everything you could do to reach it. it's the process...not the end result. ok, i know that may sound like a "get out of jail free" card...but it's the striving and making do with what you have. you neva know what you have until you try. and that's where the work begins. when you try there is no failure!
really...no...really? huh? why? sad..."another one bites the dust.."
well, when i was under contract i went through quite a few (free). seriously though shoes at the time were good for perhaps a month. training and racing shoes. now i think it could be about the same. for me, i go through a pair in about three months or so. right now...it's ok. yeah running will do it for you. but if you can't run, don't give up...take the time you have for running and use it to walk...many times a person gives up physical fitness because they gave up the time to something else...me included. i have reclaimed the time. if i can't run i don't... i walk. puppy boy needs to get out to run in the fields with his buds. we have two other dogs.
hi!!!! wow! ah, my mom was from antigonish. beautiful. nice plaid, too. i did have a skirt at one time but now i have a scarf.
hi!!!!! i attended quincy college when it was a community college...for hmm, i think three semesters. notice i mentioned attended..lol you're an aries. i do not know whether to congratulate you or send you a sympathy card ;) lol!! you are head strong. you poor dear. though it makes you determine. people called me obstinate, stubborn ..i called it "stickittofness". and you will spit blood before you let go of a goal. so make the goal...and go for it. you'll have fun..because it's fun.
no she just claims to be. this lady also doesn't seem to be native either.
you certainly look irish. i wouldn't have even batted an eye. maybe that's why the "war whoops" because they thought you were being funny since you look incredibly white.
reading this has made me so sad. i'm a woman and i want to run, but i'm often reluctant to go outside alone because of everything you've said. it's infuriating that this is just the way things are for women in this day and age. if you're a male runner, think about it- have you ever thought twice about running the same route at the same time over and over? have you ever been worried about running in the dark? alone? what the hell? why do modern women still have to worry about this?? this is truly sad.
thanks for your response! i had a really interesting conversation with one of my running idols (she is a local woman who started back into running at 35 and wins a lot of local races) and she talked about how winning can suck sometimes, because when you don't win people think there is "something wrong". do you ever find that?
we don't all do 100 milers but i think a couple people in our group have. we all participate in a variety of runs. especially trail running. we would love to have you come to fond du lac reservation in minnesota!
thanks for doing this! did you ever suffer from plantar fasciitis? if so, how long did you usually take to recover? i'm having issues right now. going to pt for a couple weeks but hasn't seemed to get too much better. it's really discouraging having such bad pain in my feet after 10 minutes that i need to stop even though i feel like i'm just getting started.
whoa! seems like you've had quite the life :) any plans to write an autobiography?
i let my jogging habit lapse when i moved away from the park i ran in, but today i got out of bed and jogged half a mile because i saw a pokemon i wanted. pokemon go is one of the best things that ever happened for my motivation!
there are actually 6 muscles in your thigh that have been discovered now! 2 are rarely taught though. the newly discovered one is the tensor vastus intermedius! (i was in exercise therapy for a while so thought you might find it interesting)
glad to hear you're problem free! you're probably already taking this stuff as well, but just in case... you might want to add collagen/ gelatin, hyaluronic acid and omega 3 to your diet if you haven't already, for the joints, and vitamin k2 for the bones. a natural source of k2 is gouda cheese, and for supplements i recommend the mk4 variety as mk7 seems much too strong (i'm not the only one saying this, but anecdotally, mk4 always gives me a boost of energy the very next day, and the last time i took mk7 i think it gave me a hemorrhoid! i have megadosed with mk4 to great effect and feel fairly safe doing so, although i can go months without taking any) sadly, i only know of supplements for hyaluronic acid, as cooking denatures it. i wish you continued happiness and success!
thanks so much for your reply! i used to love running at dusk along wollaston beach! these days i live in the city and run along the charles a lot, which is also nice. that is so great that you tried out in '84! awesome that you have no regrets. you have had an awesome career (so far) and i love that you ran for the feeling more than anything else. we should all be so lucky! good luck with everything!
thank you very much for your answer! i thought of another question: besides running, what else has been instrumental to your happiness? i previously used mindfullness, gratitude, and meditation, but then when i got engaged and as school and my job got more challenging, i stopped mindfullness. meditation has decreased and my gratitude routine changed since my husband and i started living together.
not trying to be a dick, but wouldn't it be more like biologically male to "woman/girl"? no matter what they're not going to grow ovaries or a womb, and a female to male transperson isn't going to grow testicles or a prostate, my understanding is that it's fairly important to distinguish between biological gender and identified gender since certain complications can be exclusive to one or the other.
haha a scarf is certainly good enough, antigonish is a nice place. just a hint for you but because it's canada's 150 year of being a country they're giving away national park passes for free; so if your thinking about traveling, now's the time!
i understand your question, and your friend is right, but i never cared. winning was only important to me in the sense that i was beating someone...if i didn't win, i usually set a pr. people forget that i never won the boston marathon, i placed 2nd three times...they were all so broken-hearted they just changed history to fit their memory. other people have their goals too, and my motto was "if you can't beat them, make 'em spit blood." i always put up a fight, whether i placed 1st or 30th.
follow dr's orders. my rule of thumb is always "if you can run, run. if you can't, don't." i ruptured my plantar fascia and i had surgery to have to reattached, which is more painful to recover from...i ruptured it in december at the tuft's track, and had surgery at the end of febuary. i didn't take a step towards running till september...and promptly got a stress fracture. (my first one). i'm so sorry...it's so hard. stretch, ice, and heat. wear a lift in your shoe if you can. it shortens the muscle in your calf and relieve some of the pain. recover will take a while...tendons are very fibrous with very low blood flow. it takes me 45 minutes to stretch out my calves...it's a process. i use a homemade ointment that's peppermint, lavender, and lemongrass, mixed with coconut oil. i drink hawthorne tea for inflammation, too. it'll just take time. you can do it! :) (and don't swim. or bike. stay off your feet as much as possible.)
yes!! i love pokemon go! i'm getting candies for my snorlax to power him up (he's so cute). i'm a level 30, my husband is a level 33, and my daughter is a level 25. we're all team valor! what team are you? :)
i hasn't it hit yet...is it out? hmm, i only got shellanders today. in a row. and not good ones.
congratulations! yes, life happens! it'll come back. wait until it all gets ahead of you and you'll come running back towards what was good for you. i know, i know. well mindfulness is huge iin everything. and yes, i still shove things iin my mouth...and thing go in one ear and out the other. though i am catching it earlier than i once. much like my stressors during a race. catch my down falls before they destroy the whole race. so what else do i do...theres not too much i can do other than increase time on meditation. five minutes is a lot for me at this time. though i do look forward to what giancarlo esposito (aka gus fring from breaking bad). he can sit for forty five minutes and listen to his breath. how cool is that? lol, i think that would be soooo cool. but five minutes is my mindfulness as i know it. another thing i do now quite a bit, is pray the our father.
i'm going to give them a shot. anything to mix up the piles of rice i'm currently eating. thanks for the tip.
what does ticketmaster do with all the pain they harvest from the souls they rip off at the box office?
what "insider tips" do you have to get good tickets? can i bribe a ticketmaster employee for good seats?? :-)
ive been doing that for almost 3 years! my theater is going dark for 3 months now and i am jobless try as i might. which ticketmaster did you use? we had an old school version tmwin99
why did they switch to ticketmaster? did ticketmaster convince them to through a sales pitch or did they just go out and select the most famous and biggest broker without looking at all the competitors of ticketmaster? why did they no longer sell in house? what reason did they give?
are there any advantages to showing up in person at the box office to get tickets vs. online?
did you primarily do business in sports or theater sales where you were located? always wondered what these jobs entailed, to be honest.
what was the average "convenience fee" for tickets there?
have you ever done the water driving range at the gsr?
what was the busiest day of the week at work? what was the slowest hour of the week? what was the busiest hour of the day at work? what was the slowest hour of the day?
do you think any other options will be available in the future to purchase tickets? i know some bands like pearl jam have tried but have failed. or, what would it take to overcome the power of ticketmaster? on a side note, i met one of the multi millionaire early investors of tm. i can't remember his name. it wasn't paul allen but he was up there and the guy was creepy as fuck. 50 years old dressed in all black wearing gucci shoes. just gave us the creeps.
was the turnover at the box office as bad as it was everywhere else at the gsr? also, how did you feel about the horrible management?
how often are you on reddit and what are your favorite subreddits?
hey there fellow reno area guy. what happened to the prop airplane from hello hollywood, hello?
so how did gsr feel after amy schumer spent the first 15 minutes of her act talking shit about the venue? for background: she was originally booked for their grand theater, which is one of the best venues in town. then they decided to do renovations on the theater and they moved her to a convention room with ziptied dining chairs and a temporary stage.
before tickets go on sale to the public, what percentage of tickets are already sold off?
hey man, thanks for doing this. i'm a little late to the party but hoping you see this.. have a couple of questions. 1) what's to prevent people from using ticketmaster as a "showroom" of sorts then converting to the venue's website and purchasing from there to avoid the ticketmaster fees? does ticketmaster own the inventory or do they have exclusivity via the contract, etc. could you shed some light here? 2) what's ticketmasters opinion of the secondary market (stubhub, seatgeek, etc.)? 2a) does ticketmaster price to discourage resale? or are they in collusion with the secondary market to maximize value to each channel? 3) do you have an opinion of nathan hubbard? think he probably predates you but he seems to understand the pain consumers go through when acquiring tickets (although he didn't really do too much about it). 4) final request - give me your insider's-opinion on how we fix this market for the consumer.
so i read that the whole idea of ticketmaster is to throw extra fees on and take the pressure off of the artist or venue. for example. better for your favorite singer to charge $50 a ticket with ticketmaster throwing on $20 in fees as compared to $65 for the ticket and $5 for the fees. their whole model is to take the ire of the fans off of the artist/venue. that is why they don't have competition. have you heard this, do you know if it is true?
what hours of the day did you work? how many hours did you work per week?
how much does ticketmaster give to politicians so that they don't get regulations and laws written against their anti-competion and anti-consumer friendly rules and prices?
how often do you get to lake tahoe and the ski slopes nearby?
what is your most angry customer story? what was the funniest moment at work?
what would you have loved to have to make your job easier and/or customers' lives easier?
grand sierra in reno? stayed there about 10 years ago. pretty swanky.
i just bought tickets yo a local show and ticketmaster sold my address to a ton of advertisers. how do i tell them to fuck off? i don't remember checking any sell my address boxes. my email was never bombarded with so much spam. it's all "music related" and conveniently says it comes from "not ticketmaster". i know it was them, it showed up directly after i bought tickets.
i do broadway-related things, and i want to pursue a career in it. what info can you give me regarding how my role (pun intended) could play in relation toward ticket sales? how could my performances promote to certain companies like stubhub or ticketmaster?
i'm probably dropping in too late but i recently bought tickets online to a concert. i knew when they would be going on sale so i was ready before hand. by the time i got to choose my seats the whole show was nearly booked. how can that be? if all seats go on sale at the same time, how are so many already sold as soon as they go on sale?
what is a convenience fee? can you make it inconvenient for me and not charge me this fee?
why is it that, when i tried to buy u2 tickets at the minute they went on sale, they were instantly sold out, but that there were hundreds of tickets on sale via tm in the days and weeks before the show date?
hey, cool! another box office person! i manage a major theater's box office. some years ago, i also worked at a box office that served as our city's only ticketmaster outlet (now long gone.) i fell into box office by accident, needing stable income to support my stage management habit, which ended up developing into a career. how did you end up in box office? do you want to continue with that career path? i'm currently hiring at my box office, and none of my applicants have previous experience in the field. what do you recommend saying to fresh newbies?
how do you feel about the annual arrival of the burners?
are they paying for your chemo treatments? i hear that company is cancer incarnate.
do brokers get the advantage of presale (and the better seats) and then jack up the prices for us regular folk? no matter how early i buy, for bigger shows, i can never really get that close. then i look on broker sites that seem to have awesome seats, with a 400% mark up.
small world. when i worked at tm my team was building a web based replaced for the old windows & command line interface they used at box offices & outlets. we rolled it out for the beijing olympics, but i left for google after that. did it ever get deployed globally?
why don't venues price their tickets properly to avoid massive shortages that allows scalpers to make a killing? why not just charge what the scalper would charge and actually pocket that cash yourself?
how much over minimum wage did they pay you to buy your morals and conscience? what is the going price to be a professional piece of shit?
so funny story- there's this machine we kept in the back, right, called the hate engine. we have these siphons right underneath the desk that suck up all the complaints to add to the hate engine, and the engine converts that hate into more money, which is why they keep adding service fees. more fees = more money = more hate = more more money. seriously though, nobody paid me to be a fan of ticketmaster's practices. this whole ticket monopoly situation is kind of fucked right now. best lesson i learned at the job was to always buy from the venue directly when i can.
it doesn't really work that way anymore, unfortunately, at least according to my experience. a lot of it's the usual "get in early and get lucky". with casino tickets specifically, though, there is the vip angle to consider. good casinos reward their players really well, and for us in particular we had presales a day before public sales just for our players. also, depending on circumstances we'd sometimes get tickets back from our vip folks for sale if they just weren't doing the numbers they expected, which would lead to some last minute openings- usually in the primo seats too, just because the vips get the good stuff to keep them coming back.
yeah, we used the old-school dos-ass tmwin99. when i was training people i always said it's like using a program written in swahili or something- you can learn a phrase or two and learn your way around to do some basic stuff, but beyond that it's really tough to figure out unless you've been doing it forever. it's a lot of rote memorization and repetition, which takes new guys a while to figure out.
getting to the next prompt via tmwin is still the fastest way to interact with the ticketmaster backend. it's so cryptic that you almost might think it a secret code... but those that learn it can do things at a tiny fraction of the time that it would take to use any "user friendly" method. there have been a few "easy" interfaces created, going back to dos then windows and then web based... but what they all had in common is that they slowed down the boxoffice experts and so they only ever got traction in certain specialized areas. still trying to create an interface that is easy to use for new employees while giving the speed and power to the power users... very difficult to get right.
we still sold in house, we just used an in-house ticketing system that worked in tandem with the room reservation system before (i think it was called showgate) and switched to all ticketmaster in tandem with a major remodel about two years back. the difference in show quality was noticeable- we were getting good shows before, but we jumped from d-listers on average to b-listers. no taylor swift or metallica or whatever, but still a lot bigger draws that pulled in a lot more sales. i'm willing to bet a lot of them got on board because their agents or record labels or whatever work exclusively through ticketmaster. like it or not, they opened doors.
here in tampa at amalie arena it is definitely worth it to go to the box office. you save on all the convenience and print at home and whatever else bs fees.
it varies based on the venue, but i always recommended it. you're sure to get someone who actually works there and (unless they're brand new) knows the floor plan and what sort of things to look out for. for instance, in our venue i know about the extreme angles and where the seats stagger well and where they don't, and i'd seen shows from just about every angle to get a good idea of the views. for our specific venue you paid less in service fees buying it in person ($2.50 per as of the time i left) which was really nice as well.
our venue did music and comedians mostly. before we renovated a few years back we'd have amateur mma live, which was interesting, but also tricky to handle since the theater wasn't designed for that sort of setup (since all the seats are on one side and whatnot). the stage was actually enormous, which gives a lot of room for some of the real showmen that have come through (alice cooper, empire of the sun, and kiss come to mind) to work with cool set designs.
in person it was free, $3 extra per over the phone. recently they added a $2.50 fee on top of that to everything, no clue why. still dirt cheap in person.
i really don't know anything from the legal side of things, but from a sales side we can't really do much about it beyond saying "hey don't scalp around us". once you bought a ticket from us, we were hands-off: what you do with it after that is up to you. when people asked me i would always always always recommend against buying from them since i only ever saw it when it went south and someone got scammed, but that's as much influence as we had on it. we're not just gonna not sell to someone, no matter what we think they might do with the tickets.
allllll the time, dude. this is a throwaway so i don't wanna be specific, but a lot of gaming subs.
it's still there, dude. saw it a few days ago when we ate backstage for my little going away party.
i can't speak for anyone but myself of course but man, i think she can go fuck herself. heard from one of my bosses at the time that she was being an asshole to the people working at wardrobe and all that too. i'm sure she's probably nice to some people but that was a pretty dickish thing to say.
a looser refund policy. ours was "no refunds unless the show cancels" so there were many times where something happened and people couldn't go and we couldn't do anything about it, which sucks for everyone involved.
my best guess is it's u2, they're hugely popular, so tons of scalpers got to it.
i used to work in the industry. yes, the brokers have access to most of the presales. they have their own paid forums where they share the presale codes and other information.
if the venue charged what the scalpers charged and they still bought it up, what's stopping them from selling it at even more of a markup?
also, check the websites of your local free alt-newsweeklies and magazines (the free ones that have local stories and culture, like the village voice) they almost all have deals with all of the local venues (it's how they survive) and you can get fee-free tickets!
the solution to this is stop buying these tickets at these ridiciulous prices. stop it you charlatans. let them lose money for a while. and then the prices will drop.
so instead of spending $1000 on a $100 jacked up by some scalper, i should spend $1000 at a casino and get the ticket comped?
interesting! i also worked at a box office at a casino that used ticketmaster, but we absolutely had control over some of the good seats to an extent. couldn't be super obvious about it and wouldn't do it on super popular shows. but we held tickets for so many different things - media, community (tribe), artist, giveaways, vip, business council, etc. with so many good seats on hold, if the community seats weren't selling well it was super easy to just swap out the community holds and get someone tickets in the first 5 rows. we also had the ability to go in and snag tickets before the presale/on sale although that was a huge no no and fire-worthy so people didn't do it very often. i'm also curious if your vips were crabs about it haha! i remember so many people feeling so entitled to tix in the first 10 rows, who were not anywhere near our highest level of play. fun to read your answers though! thanks for doing this!
how could you recognize professional ticket scalpers? did they ever try to bribe you?
when i was first training i wrote a python code that printed and responded to tm commands so i could practice. building it also was super fun and probably helped me learn it faster. wish i still had the code.
i used to be one of the technicians that would service the machines and printers. even though the command line method was not as easy or pretty, it is very very secure. i worked with a few of the programs they were pushing out and yeah it is pretty and easy to navigate. but it is so much easier for somebody off the street to steal tickets if they were in the box office for whatever reason. plus from a technical stand point connecting a machine using tmwin was so much easier as opposed to the moar advanced stuff. serial cable from computer to printer, make sure both are on the right ports and done. the moar complex the program the bigger pain in the ass it was to troubleshoot.
my rule is always accept free money. never be bribed. i would have pocketed his hundred and asked him if he would like a different seat.
however you fucked me on parking at a lightning game last year. charged me $20 plus fees for a parking pass and they were taking $15 cash at the lot i had to goto. thanks
what if you live in like sarasota or plant city and you can't get to the box office at their normal hours because of traffic and work or school, you kinda are screwed .
if someone is rude to you, would you intentionally give them seats with a bad view? that's something i would do.
what about for a really popular show? my fear with going in person is that if you aren't at the front of the line at the box office when tickets go on sale that you'll end up with nothing. for a show that's likely to be a quick sell out is there any advantage to going to the box office or are you better off on the website?
that's pretty cool...sounds like a neat venue for specialty events. amateur mma? that must have taken some logistics to get right as you alluded to...wonder how the turnout was.
doesnt the gsr stage hold some kind of record for being big? i saw the postal service there, and chvrches, good times.
i guess the people who don't live within 30 minutes of the box office are kinda stuck with the fee.
there are multiple methods to make scalping a pain in the ass, such as photo id on tickets or credit card checking at venues - is it as simple as "this costs more money so we don't bother doing it"?
are you at all pumped for metro exodus that was announced today? this is my shot in the dark question
haha have any other acts used the plane in your tenure there?
ticketmaster has a resale outlet of their own on their site though don't they? the thinking is probably that people can sell their tickets back through ticketmaster (with more service fees of course because ticketmaster) and get their money back without the venue/artist/promoter losing their sale
but how did it happen literally two minutes after tickets were on sale? instantly sold out.
are the presales the only access they have, or is there other avenues that they have to secure the best tickets?
do you think there is an unlimited demand at any price? the scalper sells it at the highest price the market would bear. why doesn't the venue?
makes sense, not all venues work the same way. can't really speak for the ones i didn't work at.
ticketmaster is like the iron bank of braavos. motherfuckers get their due.
ticket master is owned by live nation. live nation owns most of the venues out there and will sub contract its ticket sales back to the parent company. that's why you will often have fees at the door of the venue as well.
he was checking out the village voice, seeing who was playing where pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear five words like a beacon of light in the mist ministry live at the ritz
i remember that from an electric forest ticket thread. the guy was trying super hard to contact you and was beside himself. made a whole thread about it and everything. good thing it worked out for everyone.
why fuck ticketmaster? it's not like they made you give it up.
a lot of times we didn't really care- once the ticket's been sold we have no way to police what you do with it (and honestly probably shouldn't, there's very little fundamental difference between giving a ticket to a friend and selling it on the internet beyond the exchange of money). back when we were able to do outside sales for other venues we'd get a guy coming in every once in awhile around 10am pst, right when shows went on sale. dude's name was dave, he scalped and knew tm back to front (he showed me where to find the macro commands and whatnot). nice guy, we knew what he was doing but as far as our "jurisdiction" went he was a guest buying tickets. we didn't really have the ability to deny him tickets or anything like that. there's significantly less power to combat scalping at the cashier's end than people seem to think there is. we're not paid to guess what you're going to do with your tickets, we're here to sell you tickets.
yeah, coding's never been my strong suit. glad you figured out a way to pick it up quickly though, that shit gets complex.
it's no more secure than anything else. security through obscurity is not a valid thing.
no idea. weird language on my end, my bad. we've gotten blind people coming in before, they just take the cheap seats way in the back since the sound's good through the whole place.
hey, i've had a very partially sighted friend and a fully blind lecturer at uni. you don't have to feel sorry for them (generally), just be accomodating in practical ways if you encounter them - like any other disability.
i'm sure it was that guy personally pocketing your after tax dollars and laughing maniacally.
check a record store! sarasota's gotta have one. i always get cheaper tickets from the daddy kool in saint pete
if anything, i'd find them the best seats i could. a lot of times the rude ones are really picky. there wasn't really a bad view in our venue, it wasn't big enough, so my goal became "make them go away as fast as possible".
they had amateur mma at the fairgrounds near my house a couple of times. i almost went with my then girlfriend's teenage kid once as a goof because we are the least likely people ever to go to something like that (middle aged hippie and arty gay kid) but it was like $80 for tickets so fuck that. they only did it twice so it couldn't have done well. santa barbara was probably a poor choice to hold something like that in the first place.
i keep seeing replies like this... is this real life? obviously if you have zero access to the venue before the event you want to attend, you can't take advantage of the "buy at the venue tip" that has been shared here. people keep pointing this out, as if you're being slighted because it's inconvenient for you to buy in person, when in reality that's the whole purpose of the online system and "convenience" fees. sure everyone knows they're inflated, but it's saving you a trip to get tickets--that's the convenience! and the overall message here (if paying fees just deeply offends you) you can drive to some/most venues and buy tickets with fewer fees.)
it wasn't too bad on phones, either. that was still directly through us, just an extra three bucks. pretty reasonable.
those methods are effective at making scalping a pain, but they also make it a pain for regular customers too. people who don't have a credit card and normally use their parents, or people who want to buy tickets as a gift. or even just people who buy tickets and find out they can't make it and sell tickets at face value or give them to friends, etc.
i think david copperfield vanished it once, but that was before my time. these days it just sits backstage with some other old sets and stuff.
graphic design. left this job for one in my field.
just from my experience i see tons of people that won't buy tickets past a certain price. shows have gone without selling out despite high demand when the prices were set too high, so i could definitely see it hurting business depending on the specific show. shows that weren't much of a draw in the first place might not get sales at all. it's kind of a tenuous balance, but i never had a hand in pricing the shows so i wouldn't know more than that.
my mom goes to a ticketmaster kiosk at walmart. never checked it out for myself. there still fees through the kiosk?
why don't you care about people abusing the system
sigh... (types in a string of code to release print flag and start all over!)
used to work with ticketmaster too, but at a venue. i actually sort of enjoyed tmwin99. autypes ftw.
it's not a valid thing in theory, but in practice it is
so what did your boss end up doing to show him what it's like to have money? did he take him out back and kneecap him like the good old days of the casinos? did he take him to the high rollers room and let him see thousands of dollars being poured into a single tug on the helllooooo machines? did he show him the vault then kick him out? i'm burning with questions as to how this ended.
you also don't need to be so touchy about language. a blind person will say "it's nice to see you" even though she can't see you.
if it's more for tickets and less for fees, then at least they're not all-but-lying about the price. "only $20! just $20! wow, $20? that's cheap! (not including tax, title, license, kickbacks, business enrichment fee, we-want-to-charge-you-more fee, and mumble mumble fuck you whatever fee.)"
record stores still exist?? forgive me for being ignorant here.
...? i'm talking about living in an area that i love. not sure what idea you/downvoters got.
oh, even if it's true, you really shouldn't say things like that on the internet. that just encourages even more people to be assholes acting entitled to something.
i put the"convenience fee" in quotes because often times it's more than the cost of 2 or 3 gallons of fuel. even some box offices actually charge the fee.
why would it be three dollars extra on the phone and nothing extra in person? both sides benefit from doing phone sales instead.
i'll never get why people downvote comments like this. this comment obviously complements the discussion. **don't downvote something just because you don't like it. downvote something if it doesn't compliment the topic.**
i vaguely recall that when i was way younger too. funny to think they've hung on to it 35 years
what you are describing is dynamic pricing and it's a model that many ticket resellers use.
knowing ticketmaster, it probably costs more to use the kiosk than it does to buy online
c'mon man, i'm from michigan where it's called pop. but note how i chose my words carefully.
only ever learned wcprtdos, honestly. i still keep in touch with everyone i worked with so if you know any good ones i'll send them their way to mess with.
i was too busy being extremely pissed at that guy for being an incredible asshole, honestly.
it would be nice if they were forced to advertise an all in price like airlines are now. i'm lucky the venue i go to the most uses another ticketing platform that charges about $4 per ticket for fees.
but why did you feel the need to talk about san francisco here?
well yea. why do you think its called a convenience fee?
michigan here, too. "soda" is becoming more and more popular, i just don't think i'm ready for such a drastic change in vernacular.
san fransisco isn't the only place with a bay and an area surrounding said bay.
i responded directly to someone talking about the tampa bay area, to them about living in tampa. i guess people mistook me for a white supremacist, and now they can't connect two simple geographical concepts... sometimes i wonder if there should be a license needed to use the internet so people don't hurt themselves.
pretty sure that guys joking because if he did it he could be putting himself back at the venue or at least doing venue related work.
exactly. pay $5 online for the convenience of not having to pay $10 at the kiosk. makes perfect sense.
my friends and i made it up in about err 1995. so yes, now you too will never be free of it.
gosh, i miss 9" nails. may have to go look them up because my casette is long gone!
honestly i didn't mind this job at all. i had zero interest in it being a long-term career, but i'm glad i worked there instead of at a fast food place or mall store or something.
i don't think i've ever seen anyone use the " mark when spelling out nine inch nails before
to be fair, being about 80% surrounded by lakes, we are fairly secluded from the rest of the u.s. not sure what they call it in the u.p., but that doesn't matter. they might as well be east wisconsin.
were there episode ideas that were refused by disney because of content matter or the company did not think it would be suitable for their general audience?
what do you two think of *bill nye saves the world*?
did you think that years after the show was cancelled, kids would still be screaming "bill bill bill bill" every opportunity they got? that song is like 90s kids national anthem.
were you ever approached about working on the new show? i would think if they were going for a reboot then they would want your opinions. at this point the new show is destroying what you guys helped bill create, he needs you guys to come back to him and recreate the magic you once had!
how important do you think striking a balance between entertaining your audience and informing them is? was there ever a time or topic where you found it difficult to keep it fun enough for kids to stay glued to the tv but still educate them?
how was bill off camera? how much did he play up his personality?
when you made bntsg, how much were you influenced by mr. wizard's world? i loved both and it seems like a great heritage of bringing science to kids.
why was the part about chromosomes determining gender taken out of the netflix version of the series?
iyo, has bill changed in his approach to science, since you guys did the show together? like has he flopped his stance on anything he once believed?
hi! thanks for doing this ama. who did the lyrics and shots for the queen lighteefah music video? oh my god, that was so hilarious and awesome...
how did you pick nye? were there other candidates with more academic credentials passed over in favor of nye's stage presence?
are you related to the other famous gottlieb from the pawn stars franchise?
bntsg will probably make the history books for its profound impact on this generation as we grow up and become more involved in the world. maybe a silly question, but do you feel that the show in a way fulfilled your life destiny/was what you were "meant to do" ?
what do you desire for future educational programming? do you have a favorite educational show that's on right now?
hey guys, i think we may have a mutual connection with the fellow standing on the far left of that photo you're holding. spencer mcculloh here. didn't expect to see you two on reddit this morning! but anyways here my question haha. how did bill nye end up being the science guy for the show?
hey guys! big thank you for bill nye the science guy. i grew up watching it for my middle school science curriculum (i was homeschooled). i probably wouldn't have gotten my degree in chemistry in college otherwise. big thank you! for your new show, have you had pushback in regards to finances being too "adult and boring" to teach kids?
"eat your crust richie" is still one of my favorite quotes of all time. how do you feel knowing that whenever the big tube tv was rolled into a science classroom, everyone in the room knew that we were going to watch the science guy, and we were all over the moon?
are there any statistics that detail the effects the bill nye show has had on young people? is there any hard evidence that suggests there could be a trend between the amount of millennials pursuing science based degrees and professions and the original airing of your show?
how long did it take to produce the average episode of bntsg and what was your production cycle like and what did the process entail?
scientists like to debate almost everything. how did you deal with members of the scientiffic community taking issue with certain subjects that were covered on bills show?
what do you think of the politicization of science in our culture? i find it despicable and dangerous.
how much did bill get paid to go left and lie about how many genders there are?
who would win in a fight to the death, bill nye, or mr wizard?
how do you become a show creator/producer? i have always wanted to create a show but i don't have any money. do you start as a pa?
1. how did you guys meet bill? 2. what is something you enjoyed during your two week stay in japan? (awesome pic by the way!) 3. how tricky was it to incorporate and properly balance humor into the show without it getting in the way of educating? 4. who or what would you say have had the most influence on you and what you do? thanks for the ama, guys. and thanks so much for co-creating such a wonderful and informative show.
which one of you was the deep-voiced announcer guy?
you mentioned that you worked on almost live! do you have any funny stories about that time? any chance of a reunion show?
how has getting a show produced changed as the technology has evolved?
i recently went back and watched old bill nye episodes and your brand of humor/production (cutting clips, editing in sounds, wacky digital antics) struck me as waaaaaay ahead of its time. in fact, it kind of reminds me of tim & eric awesome show great job. who's idea was it to have such zany post-production?
what do you think of bill nyes current show? do you approve of the censoring of the one scene in the episode regarding gender that netflix ripped out?
what are your personal thoughts on alternative medicine such as crystal therapy ? and psychedelics?
the science of economics is rarely included in general popular overviews of science, and the expositions of it are rarely counted as science popularization. (for instance, i can't think of a children's economics show with roughly the same role in relation to adult ones like *free to choose* and *the age of uncertainty* as *bill nye the science guy* is to *cosmos*.) as the producers of both *bill nye the science guy* and *bizkid$*, why do you think this is so?
which came into your life first: a man named bill nye that had a persona that required you to build a show around or the idea of a fun science show directed at kids that begged for someone like a bill nye to pull it off?
did you know that bill wasn't actually an accredited scientist when you made the show? is that why he is a "science guy" instead of a scientist or was it just that it rhymed?
why does bill nye say sex is on a spectrum, when it is instead due to chromosomes?
question: following the disappointing return of bill nye, with his "saves the world" show, have you been asked to produce a future show? the show changed my life and was one of the best highlights of childhood. there is no reason it cannot be replicated for today's kids (if in the right hands as we have just learned). i hope you guys and bill reunite.
why did you not come forward and debunk bill nye as a real scientist, instead you let him portray a mechanical engineer as a phd scientist in multiple fields? don't you think that is a false narrative when dealing with facts and scientific data in an area that is based upon truths?
actually disney totally left us alone, we did what we wanted. we got one note from michael eisner that said "love the show, could use more history" (eg)
we actually haven't yet seen it. i (eg) just saw the documentary bill nye: science guy and loved it. i laughed, i cried.
my name's bill and that's usually the first thing people say to me when they find that out.
good question. bill leaned more to education, we leaned more to entertainment, a constant battle so to speak. we always felt if they are not having fun they will tune out. bill kept us on point with the message. we always tried to present different ways to learn, i (eg) got the most out of the sketch/humor parts, so i always leaned towards that. bill always had great real world analogies. there were times we felt a show might be a little flat and then it went thru audio post at bad animals and we were always cracking up in the final review.
very high production quality. we were so bummed when we first heard about the show actually hitting the airwaves before us, we thought we were doomed. but then we said - hey - there's more than one oprah, as in talk shows....can there really be too many kid science shows out there. we embraced it. (eg)
funding. we got up to 85 episodes in the can and disney said no more. our exec elizabeth brock brilliantly went to pbs and said disney wants to fund 15 more to get us to 100 episodes. then she went back to disney and said pbs wants to fund 15 more episodes...so they both kicked in and we made it to 100 episodes and then money dried up. (eg)
bill was very much influenced by mr. wizard. when it came to the production of the show we were very influenced by mtv sports and the pbs show square one television.
we were as surprised to hear about this as anyone. we actually found out about it through reddit comments. we have no idea who did the edit. (jm)
i was hoping someone would ask this. doubt they will answer.
as far as i know, nothing flip-flopped, if anything he seems to have become more political. we totally support his stance on climate change. (eg)
a show on vacuums. not my idea. someone whom i very much admired suggested it as a show topic and it blew my mind. why hadn't we thought of that during the series?! also, i would have loved to have gotten a shot of bill standing in pompeii with vesuvius in the background. one shot i did get of bill that is one of my favorites is actually an homage to u2 and frank sinatra. bill is sitting on the back of a convertible, driving down the old strip in vegas. he looks around, then says "las vegas, nev. yep, still haven't found what i'm looking for..." (jm)
probably not. i also wished i was related to the gottlieb pinball machine empire. (eg)
absolutely. i majored in film and broadcast production and minored in environmental science - and when i grew up i wanted to do environmental documentaries....so years later i'm on the set of bnsg and a friend taps me on the shoulder and says - you know you are doing what you always wanted to do. i didn't even realize it at the time. (eg)
that it continues! and my favorite educational show on right now...you mean other than biz kid$ of course, i'd say arthur, still an all time favorite. make sure to go visit the bizkid$ website and take a look at what we are up to nowadays! www.bizkids.com (eg)
you went on to be a scientist because of the show? thank you! that was the plan. we were working on the idea of a financial literacy show for years called financial genius. we met our canadian partner, jeannine glista, with her idea for a show on kid entrepreneurs called biz kid$. now, we do about five stories on kids and their money per episode, all wrapped around one general theme. so many kids think they can't do this, but when you see where some of these kids come from and the ways they are building their financial futures, it can be mind blowing. some have become multi-millionaires. and i think if these kids can do it, anybody can. (jm)
they already said bill, because mr wizard is already dead. a bit harsh, though scientifically accurate.
bigly. when we started the series we had one of the first avid edit stations (non-linear editing) and one of the editors said he felt he was editing with mittens on. we don't shoot on tape anymore. for a while there we had to remember to brings drives to off load the media. you can probably shoot way more than you need cuz you aren't going to run out of tape. today, getting your show on can be as simple as posting on youtube, i guess. (eg)
i wouldn't call it censoring as much as updating it to fit the way scientists think of gender nowadays. also, it's been made clear in othet comment chains that netflix didn't edit the show: when they got it it was already changed.
we really didn't get any pushback on pseudoscience. we anticipated problems with the evolution show and the flowers show, which was really the sex show in disguise. nothing. we got some feedback on the populations show. interestingly, many pbs stations were afraid of the pilot episode on the water cycle. it was a little too zingy, if you can believe that. i think only 18 stations ran the pilot. disney saw the pilot and called bill. that's when things took off and our dream came true. (jm)
scientists aren't 'accredited'. part of the whole thing is anyone, anywhere, can be a scientist by simply following the scientific method. there is no accreditation board where you earn a title and it's not regulated the way claiming to be an md or jd is. would you consider the mythbusters scientists, that's also primarily engineering.
i was sitting in astoria as a kid watching those shows, so jealous of the obviously cool super smart seattle kids up north who got to hang out with bill and do science stuff.
you poor, poor man... also: "bill! bill! bill! bill!" sorry, habits and all.
did having 100 rather than 85 episodes help with syndication?
wow. who has the authority to do it? like, netflix can't do it on their own, so did it have to be a studio exec or something?
uh why would they answer a troll question. chromosomes determine the biological sex of a person. gender is a social construct. the only reason you people are asking this is to stir shit up.
do we find copies of *nature of man* and remove the sections on humors?
can someone explain why this is wrong? i thought the difference was that sex was the physical part determined by genes and gender was the social construct. or are the down voters just the alt-right-homophobic people?
he's now pro-gmo after so much research has come out refuting early scientific concerns.
do you have a favorite pinball (or general arcade) machine?
and to be fair, a scientific consensus isnt actual science its a poll.. theres big differences.
perhaps my phrasing was off. i meant having a recognised qualification in a scientific field. physics/biology/chemistry. if anyone who has ever done an experiment is now a scientist as you suggest i fear the bar has been set rather low.
but goonies is based in astoria. this makes you much cooler than the kids in sea.
was it a friend of a friend who read it on reddit?
in case they don't answer, 100 is usually the minimum needed to be considered for syndication, though clearly there's no law so exceptions can be made.
brought to you by pagliacci pizza! bnsg announcer pat cashman also from almost live, and billy quan was none other than the host of almost live, john keister! (and joel mchale was on that show too)
netflix says that buena vista gave them the series in that state, so unless something compelling emerges to suggest netflix is lying, it's seems likely that the distributor is to blame.
why are you getting down votes so hard? people still care about what gender other people have?
ill give this a go...its because it is redefining past assumptions from a modern perspective. yes, absolutely you are spot on science and our understanding of biology has and should change as we develop more sophisticated analysis techniques. but, we should never ever revise history. if anything supplement the video with a statement or "update" segment. if we revise the past, we do not learn from the past.
no they don't. plenty of people have the "wrong" chromosomes for their gender that show it's not the case (despite right wing down votes)
marx's "nature of man"? yeah, a lot of what he wrote has been updated as new information comes out. many historical texts are preserved with a forward about outdated information though.
i linked the wikipedia above, yours is basically a boiled down version of the scientific consensus. interestingly, while my comment is at -11, the wikipedia bot backing me up is at +5.
that's one thing that i find really separates a true scientist and some one who cherry-picks scientific evidence. a true scientist isn't afraid of changing their stance when presented with evidence.
primes are used in seti style searches because of an assumption that a communications method would be intelligently designed to be as decipherable as possible. if a "byte" and a "word" are both prime-length, there is only two simple interpretations of a "string". it's not necessarily true that all communication methods would use them.
that's like saying gravity is just a theory. it's not "just a poll" it's the only thing that matters, because otherwise nothing is true.
i wouldn't worry about that too much. it may have hurt bill's reputation a bit, but the original series will stand for a long time as a standard for getting kids excited about science. you guys did an amazing job.
he talks as if he wants to have an open dialogue, then interupts his guests if he doesn't like what he hears.
nah, dude, you only count as a scientist if your major in college was, "science," and your official job title is "scientist." don't you know?
while that sucks for netflix, it just means that the anger should be directed towards buena vista. just because it wasn't netflix doesn't mean it's not a bad thing.
absolutely. even if they ran an entire episode that hinged upon something that turned out to be dead wrong, we could learn about the time period and the scientific process from the result. it is never the right decision to censor the past.
science ain't bigoted because it disagrees with your tumblr bullshit, my dude.
it's organised, i don't know from where, but the question and people supporting the question all appeared at once and instantly downvoted anybody who disagreed.
wikipedia = "hard science" it's bullshit. you don't decide what you are. gender is binary and not your choice.
oh were doing that "gender is fluid and a personal decision" nonsense, ok.
plenty of people are born missing a finger too. that doesn't mean the number of fingers on a human hand is a "spectrum". those are called evolutionary defects. i'm not saying we need to get rid of them or treat them nasty or oppress them or really do anything but treat them as equals. i'm even perfectly fine altering pronouns for my trans friends. but this whole "gender is fluid and there are endless numbers of them" nonsense? yeah thats bullshit.
hippocrates nature of man, you are the one who brought up humors. also, marx never wrote anything titled nature of man, and i strongly doubt that anyone has updated the ideas in any of marx's writings, as changing marx's political philosophies from what he had written would be a massive disservice to history. a man's ideas don't get updated once he's died. other people like lennin built on his ideas, and added their own, but they never went back and changed what was written in marx's writings.
gosh, maybe people are just offended about the balance of humors thing. is that making a comeback in some alternative medicine or something? ancient greek medicine, it's so old, it must be right!
also primes wouldn't be produced by inanimate processes that go in cycles, like pulsars (whose radio output was in fact originally thought to be too regular to be natural).
no, along with 16oz of beer, each mug has 1000 micrograms of sandoz which has been stored in a climate controlled vault since 1967. trust me, it's enough. we're gonna solve the problems of the world, man.... (of all the worlds) (what if i am mormon though? i never considered that)
i second this. it's not your fault bill sacrificed science for social justice street cred.
apparently he's an absolute nightmare to interview because he doesn't answer your questions. he waits for you to stop talking so he can make some kind of convoluted point about the atmosphere that we've all heard from far better sources. back when reddit wanted nothing more than to suck is wrinkled dick, the entire site shit on a newscaster who was trying to interview him about his new upcoming show and basically gave up because literally all he wanted to talk about was climate change. he was being a huge condescending asshole and reddit ate it up. he treats interviews like an episode of hardball or something. i'm glad things have kind of changed.
i'm incredulous that a steaming service that offers manifold scientific documentaries has an "anti-science" narrative they're pushing.
i'm willing to play devil's advocate and say maybe he had bad fan experiences up to that point. i believe the science guy should stand on its own merits. even if he's truly an ass, his tv persona's reach far exceeds his individual encounters and "spreading the truth" just diminishes that for no justifiable reason beyond "my dad knew the sound guy for motley crew". he's not bill cosby, so what does it even matter?
why would it make you angry? it was edited to be scientifically valid. science has made advancements in the last 25 years, and scientists have come to the conclusion that gender and sex are different and that chromosomes determine sex. gender is a social construct. i know it makes a lot of redditors butt hurt to read but it's a fact.
t_d probably ran out of seth rich petitions to use their bots on and decided to just further a little hate speech. at least theres a lot of us and a few of them.
there are 62 sources there, feel free to choose a few you deem hard science. wikipedia is meant to be a brief, accessible introduction with sources. do you want to read a paper analyzing brain scans demonstrating the non-binary nature of gender?
the only people who think wikipedia isn't sufficient proof of something are high school teachers and little kids. don't worry little boy you can do it to. scroll down, down, more down. wow look **sources**. click on them. wow almost as if wikipedia collects only information that can be verified from external sources.
do you believe that there is fluidity in sexuality?
it's ok, i lived in seattle for a bit over a decade. i know how cool it used to be.
i may be incorrect, but it feels as though you're using that term as a pejorative. if so i would say that what saves the world was attempting was not social justice. social justice is a means to provide equal opportunities to succeed for all those within a society. what bill's show did was provide veeerrrry basic science followed up by condescending remarks aimed at the supposed opponents of science, and blanket poorly explained and generally sarcastic dismissals of opposing views. while many people will try to prop up any contemporary culture clash as social justice warriors vs _____, the term is not applicable. in this case a poorly executed attempt to pander to his own audience rather than convince the people that deny scientific work is being presented. it's pretty much the opposite of what social justice attempts to do.
my how the times have changed indeed! i remember the furious circle jerk over that larry wilmore interview just like it was yesterday...
well apparently the edit has been improperly pinned on netflix and it actually comes from buena vista.
or reality doesn't agree with you. clearly we can see this literally happening. someone down votes you, label them a troll, suggest it's organised. it can't just be reality saying you're wrong. if you down vote me, it's clearly a brigade doing it and you're a troll.
you don't have any idea how wikipedia works, do you?
what social justice means and what it is are two different things.
there is a huge difference between hard science (stem) and soft science (sociology).
i don't mind the downvotes themselves. it's that you can post a sourced fact and instead of trying to understand or source a scientific argument the other way they choose to stick their fingers in their ears and ignore it that gets to me.
controversial outside of the biology and psychology spheres, yeah. but i don't give a fuck what random idiots on the street think about gender.
can you provide anything peer-reviewed showing you are a wolf? or maybe a diagnosis from a physicians or psychologist? maybe find a quote in the dsm?
no, what people mean when they use it to denigrate people they disagree with and what it means are two different things.
except there really isn't. the distinction was made out of boastful discredulity between disciplines years ago and is propped up by contemporary people who don't want to consider or integrate changing viewpoints. you could make the more credible argument that "soft sciences" are less reliable due to greater difficulties extracting signal-heavy data and due to the relative newness of the disciplines. and you could certainly make the argument that there are many underinformed people claiming expertise on these subjects. but science, as a methodology, isn't excluded from topics just because they're difficult to study, new to rigorous scrutiny, or, most importantly, don't conform to one's existing view of what science will reveal. you can question results and methods, but denigrating entire fields of study is profoundly anti-science in itself.
they are only different when you accept the premise that they are different. however, if you're at all a reasonable or logical person you'd realize that they are not different at all.
if its a spectrum, and the genders within that spectrum are not quantifiable, nor are they, in any definitive way, discernable from each other, and they are, in practice, labelled however the owner chooses, and even if two owners have the same label, they could mean different things.... ..then you aren't actually making much of an argument that this is anything other than make believe in peoples head on a massive scale.
even in science, gender can be considered from a phenotypical or genotypical way. gender could be based on xy chromosomes (which naturally occur as xx xxy yy y x xyyy xxy etc but generally only the xy and xx can reproduce) or physical traits (a penis, a vagina, both, partially unformed, completely unformed as in testosterone immunity among xy individuals). in both cases, gender is ambiguous and there is debate on how to define gender. if its the ability to reproduce, then why and what do you with those who cannot as? if its on physical appearance, then what do you do with ambiguous appearance and behavior?
gender is not a choice. you do not choose to be male or female. what you are describing, and even in your definition, are gender roles. youre essentially making the argument that gender is based on behavior, and in actuality, therefore fluid and not a choice. like i could go play football, and im a man, then go cry at a movie and that makes me a woman?
by questioning me, you are oppressing all other-kin. i don't ask you to prove your gender, don't ask me to prove mine. *licks paw for science*
literally all of that is made up gobbledegook. also, by the way, you just gave a bunch of different names to the same thing. you just listed a bunch of different ways of saying "confused"
is there a decision as a ceo that you regret or wish you could've done better?
any word on a splinter cell game in the works. what can we expect ?
do you feel like ubisoft has improved their reputation lately?
do you enjoy games other than the ones made by ubisoft?
what's the most difficult thing you've had to do as ceo?
why is the rainbow six siege team so small, despite having one of your largest player bases?
what is your personal opinion on rainbow six siege?
what is your most beloved franchise within ubisoft? (not just now, all over the past 30 years)
how does one become a ceo? what was your early life like?
hi yves, what old game would you want to be remastered with today's graphics ?
after berlin, do you have actual plans to open further studios globally in the nearest future?
how do you deal with the negative comments from so many players about your games?
will we ever see a resolution to the desmond miles story and the modern day assassins? the way that arc ended was very frustrating.
obviously a long shot, but would it be possible to meet you at e3? so excited to see all of ubisoft's projects at e3!
google has this thing called google 20% which is set up to allow to spend 20% of employees time to work on their own projects and ideas instead of what they're hired to do. this encourages innovation. does ubisoft have anything in place for encouraging innovation? p.s not just for employees, do you allow other people to pitch you ideas and how have you made it easy for them to do it. do you try and do anything to make their ideas or projects a reality? what's the best way to approach you with an idea?
what do you see as the next big leap in gaming technology?
anything interesting on the horizon that most people don't know about yet?
hi yves!! i love watching you speak at e3, your enthusiasm for your company and games in general really comes out! what would you say is the most important quality in a game? story telling? mechanics? world-building? also, ac: origins looks incredible!!
what is the future of the division? will there be a division 2?
which chocolate do you prefer? 1. swiss 2. belgian 3. whatever's melting on my tongue 4. white, because i don't know what i'm talking about ;)
why are you avoiding to do assassin's creed set in feudal japan? :d
thank you for hosting this ama! did you ever think that when you first came into video games over 30 years ago, video games would become this big? (esports etc)
don't your fists hurt of knocking the shit out of all your competitors at e3 this year? also what's the name of your dog we saw in a video a couple years ago?
thanks for the great opportunity, sir. my questions are: 1. what's your favorite setting for an assassin's creed game? 2. can we expect prince of persia to ever make a return? 3. do you prefer story-driven games or more action and multiplayer oriented ones? 4. will there ever be a cinematic cgi trailer for assassin's creed: origins? 5. do you expect the assassin's creed franchise to end at some point? or will it continue expanding to other platforms like movies, tv shows and comics? 6. do you believe comic books are a good way to finish a game's plot? 7. can we ever expect an adventure game by ubisoft? something similar to quantic dreams' beyond: two souls? 8. can we expect a collaboration with hideo kojima? thank you!
will far cry 5 actually look like the trailer? or are we going to get another downgraded version like every game before it?
hello guillemot! my question is a concern i have about console parity. i'm planing to buy the new xbox one x. and i know playstation has marketing rights for farcry5. will you take advantage of the extra power on xbox one x for that game? and all your games for that mather? thanks and sorry if this is a silly question. best wishes to you and ubisoft from me here in norway :)
hi ! why would vivendi takeover would be so hostile to ubisoft ?
why does ubisoft continue to put microtransactions in games consumers are already expected to pay for despite them being seen almost universally as a negative inclusion by your audience?
what the hell kind of creature is rayman supposed to be? he seriously creeps me out. an alien? an animal? a lab experiment gone wrong? an especially ugly person? what? also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?
thanks for the question. i would say we were very strongly investing in mmos in the late 90's/early 2000s and we stopped that side of the business because it wasn't performing well enough and we should have continued on with that.
hi! splinter cell is a brand we talk about a lot. it's also personally one of my favorite series. we don't have anything specific to share at the moment but teams are working on different things, so stay tuned for more.
hi there, that's a good question. i think yes and no, we have encountered some problems recently and we have some work to do on improving our services. it's a tough learning experience but i think we are progressing well. at the same time i'm very proud of the games we've released over the last few years and the success of live games like rainbow six siege, the division, for honor, the crew and steep i also am incredibly proud of what we showed yesterday at our e3 conference.
to expand on this question, what games from other companies have helped inspire you and drive you to create better games for the consumers?
hi there, it would probably be decisions about which projects to persue and which ones to cancel. telling a team who've been focused on a project for several years that they won't be able to continue it is very tough. however what i have seen is when we do cancel projects it is almost always for the best, it gives us an opportunity to learn to refine our ideas and come up with better games.
probably beating the people at vivendi off with a stick.
thanks for the question! i would say the launch of the first splinter cell and the first assassin's creed were both amazing. they were the culmination of a lot of work and were both great successes. these were both fantastic moments for me as they represent turning points for ubisoft and a great pay off for big risks that we took. and of course yesterday with miyamoto was pretty special as well :)
i love it! it's the first time that we have seen that level of engagement and passion around a game we've created.
hello! what is fantastic about working with nintendo and with miyamoto in particular is that you are working with the best. it's easy to work with the smartest people in the industry and they have a great understanding of what works and we are very often on the same page about how to solve a problem.
to become a ceo i would say pick a fast growing industry you are interested in, surround yourself with the best and work hard!
i would say far cry 3 on the xbox one x would be amazing :)
hi there, for skull and bones it really needed a full team dedicated to that specific type of gameplay to create the best pirate game possible.
i would love to hear an answer for this. i loved the division despite its bugs/exploits. the dark zone pvp was possible the best i have ever played when everyone was legit. wish the player base on pc didn't dwindle to almost 0 =(
1. swiss dark chocolate! i always have a stock on my desk for long meetings.
i'm doing well, a little tired after yesterday's conference but very happy with the response what we've received!
recent ubisoft games (watch dogs 2, ghost recon wildlands, steep and probably some others i forgot) were not downgraded at all compared to the gameplay footage shown before release. so i think you can expect far cry 5 to look like in the gameplay trailer.
iirc it's called a "hostile" takeover as it's without the owners' approval, only the shareholders giving it a ok.
shadowbane was way ahead of it's time. glad you guys published it! cheers
for what it's worth, i'm a casual gamer who doesn't own a current-generation system but splinter cell is a series to which i'm devoted enough to purchase a console.
removing the uplay requirement on games you sell on steam would go a long way in improving your services, as well as public opinion. players shouldn't have to go through two stores to play one game.
you listed some games i would not call "successful" there
i'm gonna ask a difficult follow-up question. i love rayman too but why is he seemingly completely excluded from the mario/rabbids crossover? him and mario both have roots as platforming mascots so it baffles me that he is nowhere to be seen.
when one of your teams has been working on a game for years, what would make you change your mind and come to the decision that the project has to be stopped? i'm only asking out of curiosity!
quick follow-up question to you saying you look for unique multiplayer experience, does that mean you aren't necessarily interested in pursuing any style of single player and or campaign heavy titles? also thanks for taking time to do an ama
how seriously do you take large mod projects on resumes with no formal education?
hi @olafurw! i don't know anything about spyware, but since we have you here: are there any considerations of making uplay less obstructive or optional on steam? i know it might not sound like a big issue, but having to click through uplay after starting a game from steam always annoyed me. i just don't see it adding any value on top of steam for me and i'm not sure what forcing it on us does for ubisoft since drm and tracking is already taken care of by steam. sorry that i haven't got a nicer question for you. never had any technical difficulties with uplay though, so good job on that :)
this is a tough sell, as you are telling ubisoft to give up 30% of their sales price to steam (they charge money, you know)
is it a joke or are you actually complaining about a game you spent 1000 hours playing?
i don't work for ubisoft, but i can read between the lines and the only way nintendo was going to license mario was if he was the star and the star alone. rayman isn't as important to ubisoft as mario is to nintendo, so that's likely why rayman isn't present.
changes in the industry either competition or technology are definitely a factor. similarly the breakthrough that we thought we had may no longer be relevant and sometimes we do realize that we are unable to execute what we had hoped to achieve.
for people without time to watch the video the point is it's pronounced differently all over the company. french generally say oo-bee-soft and everywhere else say you-bee-soft
uplay let's ubisoft make more money. steam takes 30% of sales revenue from games sold on its platform. so for every $1mil sold of games, ubisoft would be missing out on an additional $300k if they sold on steam and didn't create uplay all together. now the fact that you can still buy say watch dogs on steam and then still have to open uplay to play makes no sense to me other than maybe they hope to try and persuade you to buy from their store by flashing you a sale ad or something as your game loads. beats me
they're already being charged money, as they currently sell their games on steam. adding the uplay requirement doesn't change that.
not a joke at all. just because you do something for a long time doesn't mean it's perfect or completely polished, or that you can't complain about the myriad issues with it. there are less than ~5k people at any one time playing this game that isn't even that old. most of the time the numbers hover just over 2k. seeing as it opened to almost 120k players and had as many as 20k players 6 months ago, yeah i'd say my gripes are valid. when a game as old as tf2 still has over 50k players on a regular basis, you know you fucked up. hell, euro truck simulator 2 has more players w/ ~20k, a fucking **truck sim**!
but they let sega make mario & sonic games. sonic is easily sega's icon.
since hindsight is always 20/20, did you ever regret stopping a project?
with how blacklist and conviction took the series i would rather have a remastered version of chaos theory than a new splinter cell.
anyone who looks at the two services would just buy the game on uplay and ignore steam. its the reason why ill never buy an ubisoft game on steam i like steam and all, but i'm not sucking valves dick like that
i understand your concerns but you must see that from ubi's perspective, you bought their game (full price i guess with your time spent) and played 1000 hours on it. they mustn't see much room for improvement after that. the decrease in players is normal since this is a game with an end and no purpose to continue after that. on my side i bought it, played it with a friend and did the missions a couple more times to get better gear then i stopped when i realized that getting better gear wasn't useful. i thought it was okay. not memorable but okay.
i liked blacklist :( but i do miss the shadow meter telling you how hidden you are along with the adjustable walking speed and more emphasis on sound
mike 'quick' swick? love your fights man. i have watched you since you first entered in. absolute mad man. do you think the new breed of mma fighters are really that good, or just that marketable?
was thailand your primary choice or did you just say phucket?
hey mike another big fan here. what made you get into fighting? what's ur gym in thailand? do dc and them train there?
holy crap! i never actually thought i'd get the opportunity to ask this, but at what point did you know you really wanted to step away from fighting, and are there days that you see your guys training and miss it? also, for a person that one day wants to go to thailand and train, how difficult is the language barrier and is there any kind of time frame where you start to pick it up?
sup mike! big fan here, ever since i saw you ko gideon a few years ago. you were one of the first fighters i got to see who actually had both real ko power and slicckkk jits. my question for you is: who's your favorite fighter/fighters to watch in the ufc today? wish you the best with your gym and life man!
hi mike! i'm a big fan. what is the craziest thing you ever saw while bouncing?
hey mike great to see you doing this i always miss these things. what's your thoughts on fighters trying to come back ie. chuck liddell , tito and now randy saying he would fill in for bellator. the reason i ask is you seem quite happy and enjoying everything you have done after leaving the sport, i wonder if they just aren't as fulfilled in their lives after the sport?
does the ufc actually measure the fighters height and reach or do you just report it to them ? hope you're doing well mike.
hi mike! i'm travelling to phuket to train this summer and i'm wondering what sets aka thailand apart from the other super-gyms on the island? what would you recommend doing on phuket that's slightly off the beaten touristy path? what led you to move to thailand and start a gym there?
what fight for you was the most memorable? both your own and one that you watched?
what do you think of bareknuckle boxing? best thing about living in thailand?worse thing?
do you run short term fitness bootcamps ? i might be interested
is there any chance for an aka gym in the philippines?
hi mike, what's your thoughts? has what conor mcgregor's done been good for the cause of ufc fighters?
what's your stance on kids and martial arts? i want to put my daughter in jiu jitsu as soon as she is of the required age. do you think that instills a sense of confidence and discipline as kids grow up? i want to raise a daughter with self esteem and confidence in herself and respect for her body...and for her to have the ability to defend herself if necessary. what's are your thoughts?
do i need to be a fighter to train at aka thailand?
do you think you would have become a better fighter if you had went to clear brook? just joking around but congrats on living out your dream.
do you train people who have a background in martial arts with a desire to one day compete in the ring/professionally? is there a screening process or do you just take anyone?
i didn't know that you operate a print factory. do you work in there yourself on the printing line? do you still keep in contact with jon fitch? you and john fitch were some of my favorites from aka back in the day.
i trained with kaensak for a couple years and it was an incredible learning experience. is he still talked about in thailand? it seems he was a pretty big figure in a really tough time to succeed in muay thai. also have you considered bringing the vlogs back? i enjoyed the shit out of those videos you made with huerta back in the day!
hey mike, are you still contractually connected to the ufc at all? if not is there any chance we get to see you have any more fights or have you completely retired from active competition? would love to see you give dan hardy one last fight.
you fish at all and if so what's your biggest catch?
what advice do you give to people when starting their own business?
do you regret doing something in your life or do you regret not doing something in your life? also what is your lpt?
hey mike, if you had to give advice to someone starting a business, what would you say?
was there any fighter you hated that you fought? do you still hate them now? who's your least favorite fighter nowadays?
mike, knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting your ufc career today?
wait, mike's gyms mike? i've seen your posters out there. they're everywhere.
if you have seen any of the tuf episodes recently. compared to when you were on it, what do you feel like has changed or do you feel like it has gotten easier or harder or do they now focus more on getting guys drunk to do or say stupid shit with the boiiiz?
does you gym have a website of facebook? congrats on getting set up after the ufc. feels like you have been around forever, thanks for everything you did in the ufc. anyone you are a big fan of these days? if you could go back and have 1 more fight who would it be?
big fan!! always enjoyed watching you fight. thanks! .. what kind of print factory?
love your fights mike, how'd you like car sales? i just got in the business 6 months ago. i'm loving it, any tips?!
what do you think is the reason for the lack of thai fighters in the ufc? considering the country's strong background in muay thai, it seems perhaps surprising that there hasn't been a top, thai ufc fighter yet
hey mike, i have a journalism degree but have been looking for my opportunity to break into the industry. a good friend of mine is already in thailand shooting for ufc and i have been looking to get over there. any advice on how you successfully transitioned over there? thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.
when is your first trip to the iss scheduled? do you need time to finish instructing the following generation of astronauts first?
how do you work up the motivation and dedication to be successful like this? i am smart but unmotivated and lazy. were you always this dedicated?
what would you say is the best way to build my future, while trying to attain my dream, even it it seems unrealistic? basically, i would like advice on how to not be dirt poor while trying live out my dreams.
what's up mike, always loved watching your fights and got to watch you fight live against marcus davis at ufc 85 back in the day. did you enjoy fighting in europe and how does preparation for a fight overseas differ to fighting in the us?
do you have any tips for people who have just started doing mma or will start recently?
hi! i'm starting brazilian jiu-jitsu this week. i'm nervous because i'm kinda out of shape and not corrdenated as a woman. any words of motivation?
how shitty is it to do your taxes? it sounds like you would have 1099s from hella places, a mess of different self employment income to repott, etc. im assuming you probably had a tax accountant do it for you.
what kind of print factory? like corrugated cartons?
hi mike! i wonder if you classes for kids/teens? if you do i would like to know a bit about your philosophy when it comes to training kids/teens in martial arts. the reason i am asking is even preteen muay thai fighters are in a sense professional prize fighters in thailand.
do the aka thailand guys get hurt as often during training as the aka san jose guys? (only asking in jest). love your fights, miss seeing you in the octagon. also, you might get more questions if you post in /r/mma instead of this iama sub.
mike, when dana let brock lesnar fight mark hunt without brock undergoing standard drug testing, how does that affect the morale of other fighters? and, how contentious are these drug issue inconsistencies within ufc, from the fighter's perspectives?
what's your advice for someone wanting to move from the us to thailand? say, someone with a wife and kid. thanks!
what are the nerves like when entering the octagon? i couldn't imagine stepping in without the anxiety of so many people watching!
hey mike, just wondering if you had to keep up with any vaccines or therapies to avoid the endemic diseases (e.g. malaria, typhoid...) in thailand when you first first moved? or if you still have to keep up with them. thats always been my biggest concern when traveling abroad. i loved watching your fights!
so besides add, were you ever diagnosed with anything else?
fellow expat here living a couple hours away from you. how do you guys balance the party/drinking lifestyle with your training? do you set rules for your students?
advice for a nak muay looking into transitioning to mma?
mike, i watched gustafsson exploit the eye-poke advantage, clearly increasing his strike output while he had teixeira fighting with one eye. what do you think the penalty should be for eyepokes?
hello, my friend told me that sports at any high level, the athletes are using peds. what are your thoughts and experiences with peds in mma? thanks for your time and god bless!
hey man, was just in thailand for 2 weeks, phuket is gorgeous. i'm considering moving there. how did you handle the visa process, it seems aside from getting married you can do a 1-year work visa, what did you do? and any advice for moving to tl?
sup mike! great to hear from you in this way and glad to see the post-fight career is moving along. been an mma-fan since the late 90's and always rooted for you! whats your thoughts on weightclasses? i think the ufc really could use a revamp around 170 where they add 165 and 175 and also maybe a cruiser weight at something like 215? weight cutting might be mitigated a bit and some of these divisions are just too damned stacked atm.
ufc changed a lot since its beginning. what do you think changed the most? what remains the same?
so you're in a job interview. they take a quick look at your resume and ask, "why haven't you stuck with one thing?" what do you tell them? is having such a diverse work history become a detriment?
thanks! rest of the answer below on your second question. duplicate.
that's a redundant nickname. i've heard swick is a portmanteau of swift and quick.
i was goingto do a gym in manila once but i was always going to do one in thailand for sure. its the mecca and phuket is the heart.
hey bud thanks! i got into fighting after watching the karate kid. my gym in thailand is called aka thailand. you can see more about it at akathailand.com. we are building it to become the largest gym in the world so its still a work in progress but moving fast. luke rockhold and javier mendez have been out here training but not dc yet. he trains full time at aka hq in san jose.
these marketing accounts are ruining reddit. might as well just make an infomercial with actors in the audience. i am curious how they work though. does the fighter's manager set them up? does reddit? are there companies for this now? maybe there should be r/infomercial.
hey reion, it was when i realized that i couldn't put 100% of myself into the fight camp and fight. i started setting myself up for a post fight career early and that just grew and grew so for the longevity of my life and future, business is just the best thing for me right now. there is no issue with the language barrier at aka thailand or in phuket. 90% of the people you interact with will have some understanding of english or speak it natively. its a very diverse location due to tourism.
thanks hussain! i have so many favorites now. my teammates at aka of course.... cain, luke, dc, thomson, khabib, etc... as well as so many others! i like the fighters who go out and put it all on the line and go for it. thanks for the kind words!
hey bud, it can be many reasons. i can attest to the fact that you really do miss the fighting itself. the walking out, the fans, the mixing it up, and of course the winning. i think its just hard for fighters to realize when they are too old to do their best. for me, i am happy and content in business now and operating aka thailand. i live vicariously through my fighters and enjoy their highs without any damage to my already damaged brain. ;)
i see the "bare knuckle" muay thai events here in thailand occasionally, but they actually do use rope over their hands. i don't follow actual bare knuckle boxing. best thing about living in thailand for me is just having the gym in such a beautiful location and interacting with such awesome people that come in from all over the world. worst thing is that thailand does not have a cheesecake factory, olive garden, in 'n out, or some other of my favorite american eateries.
we actually get a lot of requests for this! i was actually in talks to do a gym in manila before i finally built aka thailand. never know...
absolutely not. most of the guests we get are not fighters at all and are just either looking for a good workout or to have a fun experience. email info@akathailand.com, ask for marc and mention reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount. ;)
honestly, i like dan hardy and feel no need to beat him up at this point. he is doing his thing and i respect that. i am still contractually obligated to the ufc if i come out of retirement but it would take a lot to make that happen. i would have to get a fight with mcgregor. ;)
he says what he feels and people either like it or not. as far as our relationship, he has done nothing but help me even up until now. he is a guy who will always txt me back or answer my call to this day.
hello, i would like to know who your friend is. i may know him. as far as transitioning in, i think you just have to come and start networking. its an easy place to come and fit in. good luck!
i agree with the discipline and respect aspect. i do not think its a good idea for kids to fight at a young age even though it is very common here in thailand. this is a special circumstance though as it is sometimes the only means for them to escape poverty and create a future for their self and their families.
do you think the "new breed" of fighter is really that good, or just that marketable? i only ask because a good friend who had a few smokers and than went 4 and 0 in kotc. never even got a shot. just wondering if you had any insight?
awesome thanks for answering dude! 1 more if you have time. is your gym open all the time? is 2 weeks enough time to learn anything? looks amazing and i'm on vacation soon!!
i am interested in becoming an entrepreneur but have become aware of the depressing amount of funding required to start a business, at least in my field. how did you come up with funding for starting the worlds largest gym?
thanks for answering my questions, and i'm really glad you've set yourself up for success. it always worries me thinking about fighter burnout and injury rates (especially tbis), and really how many fighters have a plan after they're no longer able to step in the ring/cage.
thanks for answering my question, its super cool getting to interact with you like this! i'll definitely check out the video, and your gym looks amazing
yeah man i did not mean to criticize thailand at all i love the country. i want to know if you host classes for kids/preteens as i might want to bring my son.
it depends. some are amazing athletes with years of world class experience. some are more the showmen. others have both. my fighter, amir aliakbari came, to me with no mma fights, but world champion level wrestling, and he has had his last 5 fights in rizin and carries a 6-1 pro record.
yes we are open 6 days a week and we have many people who come for just 2 weeks and have a great time. email info@akathailand.com, ask for marc and mention reddit, and we will give you a 10% discount. ;)
you have to invest yourself(be committed), make a solid business plan, then find a solid investor/partner.
muay thai fighters can blow bubbles with beef jerky.
there are actually great places to eat all over phuket.
thank you so much for answering. mad inspiration for me to get back in shape after a bad back injury. i hope to one day meet you and maybe even hit the bags. thanks again mr quick swick.
what was the process like negotiating with owners of aka to use their brand for your gym in thailand? did u start this path knowing you wanted to have it be a subsidiary of aka? does the deal effect your bottom line in a significant way?
hahaha i see them as the honey badgers of the fighting world
the biggest, most important question for britain: do you support lord buckethead leading brexit negotiations?
what would your response be to people calling your policies "communist"?
how do you plan to bring the national debt under control. when would you do this and how would do so while paying for your huge increases in spending?
its always hilarious to me when people make delusional ama requests lol.
way too risky for potentially the next prime minister, nothing to gain, reddit users already vote for him, and we'll just ask about his views on privacy, snoopers charter and the like and realise labour are just as authoritarian as the tories.
why did you celebrate a defeat like it was a victory when labour candidates have won more seats than you and resigned?
good luck getting him to answer anything. he won't be answering.. would you use trident?
when will you finally step down so labour might actually get back into power again? the one and only question that needs to be asked.
why do you believe in multiple genders? edit "more than two genders"/
is not needed, 1) people should go to school and learn something useful. 2) stop giving hand outs to migrants that were newer worked a day in your country. problem solved.
to be fair, it wasn't his fault he lost. just all the fuckwits that voted anything other than labour.
i would really love for him to explain how he isn't a communist. or better yet why he isn't. because i can see how his views do not constitute communism, but his views are so close in underlying principle that i don't understand why doesn't just fully apply his convictions. does he see a value to capitalism? is that morally ok for him?
jeremy corbyn. a man who can preform as well as gordon brown and be declared the winner!
i don't understand why this question is down voted. it's a fair question. and the answer is likely yes, let's be honest here. he doesn't support them obviously but he does likely see where they are coming from and sympathize with them.
nobody wants to use trident you twit! we don't live in the cold war anymore, a nuclear attack isnt likely. heck, even then it sill wasnt likely...
the labour party has record levels of support. levels not even seen when tony blair was elected in 1997. i don't think he's done a terrible job. perhaps if labour had backed him and hadn't been infighting they'd be in downing street right now. i personally don't want tory light. i put the blame on blairites rather than corbyn.
whether you refuse scientific research and established medical conditions or not... the "two genders", male and female constitute as multiple genders, do they not?
tell my father that. degree in electrical engineering and worked out at cape canaveral afs for ten years. since spacex started launching there more than nasa, spacex uses autonomous launch systems for telemetry and such. he had to move on and is now working in alaska.
a fantastic and often neglected point. i've spoken to a few people who have voted other then labour, and often it's either 'well i didn't want corbyn' with no follow up or 'i always vote ______ party'. it's a shame but there we go.
you have to be joking. he shares many more parallels with socialism than communism
because he does not want to dismantle the current state and implement a communist society. he isn't communist .americuck
thanks for that, mccarthy. amazing that the powerful indoctrination against left wing politics continues in america to this day.
equating morality and economic philosophy? throw in a pinch of-- there we are, confusing socialism and communism! we did it everyone, the cold war is still on!
the difference being that labour already held the majority at the time and lost it. corbyn clawed back 20-odd seats when the polls at the time of the snap election suggested that may should have gained. all depends on what frame of reference you use as to whether it can be considered a success or a failure, really
i think it's being downvoted because it's parroting the press smears. of course he doesn't sympathise with terrorists, the only people who do are other terrorists. i've looked at a lot of these old stories and come to the conclusion that anyone who has ever tried to help any sort of peace process runs the risk of it being twisted by the press as them being a 'terrorist sympathiser'. if we're going to use the same metric, that is. i'm not irish, i'm english, but having read about the history of what england did to ireland over the years... i think it's disgraceful what was done. i'm not personally responsible for it, but my country is, and i feel ashamed that it's part of my country's history. does that make me a terrorist sympathiser?
have you ever listened to jeremy corbyn speaking? i can't be the only one looking for answers.
1) people like you will have to change the way they think regarding the parity of 1 life/1 trade. already companies are used to teach new skills and change the work position of their employees. also for ex. in france the government is offering classes to jobless people to learn new skills, in function of what the market needs. you do not need an phd to learn ms office products. 2) i already provided links and i'm talking about uk.
can you elaborate on why he had to move on (especially to alaska)? from what i understand ece is in incredibly high demand.
i feel like a lot of the anti-corbyn sentiment is somewhat of a facade for people who don't want to say they support tories - he got the highest labour vote share for decades, there doesn't seem to be the hate for him that everyone's talking about.
communism...socialism...what's the difference? /s (as a matter of fact, as a european living in the united states i have spent a significant amount of time explaining this difference to my american friends.)
yeah, but the 20 point lead was his fault in the first place
a little bit yea. if you sympathize with the ira, you are indeed sympathizing with a terrorist group.
answers about what? he's actually articulate and has views and opinions. he did fuck up that questions about how much was it childcare? would cost but they had it in the manifesto he just didn't remember it i really don't get what you mean. like even if i don't like a party i wouldn't say there's something wrong with them (well unless it's like the kkk or something)
i was looking for jeremy corbyn's opinion on the matter, not your's.
no. newbury. but a similar story. the lib dems shot themselves in the foot when they collaborated with the tories. everybody lost faith in them and they lost so many seats.
i just don't like him, if its any consolation i can't stand any of the other party leaders and i mean all of them.
socialism is specifically designed to be transition between capitalism and communism. my question is why socialists don't view themselves as communists. what is the central difference in principle between the two? a socialist is just a communist who realizes communism won't work but still wants a system as close to it as possible. so why not just call yourself a communist. it's what you believe in, you just aren't so dogmatic to sink the ship over philosophical adherence.
and it wasn't because the media launched a 2 year slander campaign contained consistently of misquotes? a campaign that failed during the election when word of mouth and social media challenged it.
well bankrupting the country a lot is something wrong with labour...
fair enough. that's true - i wouldn't say i like corbyn, just that he seems most genuine out of the bunch, besides maybe caroline lucas. none of them are likeable though, it's almost part of the job of a politician at this point to be a cunt.
a lot of it was misquotes, but some was true. like corbyn opposing the anglo irish agreement, a compromise that sought to bring stability and save lives. how can you justify opposing that? apparently it's because it recognised northern ireland as its own political entity. its definitely worth people dying for that. or what about when he was paid by the saudi state media (who are complicit in the torture of journalists, and are banned by ofcom ) to appear in their television show. he has done incredibly well pulling off the victory he did, but let's not forget that he was the one who put the labour party into the state it was before.
so true, i just ended up voting for the party that i thought would be the best to represent my area. they didn't win.
don't talk about ni politics if you don't understand them. there were many reasons on all sides to oppose the agreement.
mate, i'm northern irish, check my post history ffs. the anglo irish agreement was a compromise from both sides intending to save lives, and the precursor to the good friday agreement. anyone who opposes that is a moron.
the anglo irish agreement was quite strongly repulsed within unionist circles. over 100 000 people gathered in belfast to protest against it under a unionist banner. it gave the republic constituional powers over norther ireland and blatantly ignored many unionist leaders. i agree it was a good first step in the peace process, but calling all oposition moronic? you eejit.
this is a question from someone in your district. the quality of life in colorado is being diminished by traffic. we see improvement being made around denver, except for those of us on the north side. what will you be proposing to alleviate this critical issue?
what do you think about the fact that co real estate market has climbed so fast that middle class people can barely afford to own a home in co? the rental market is out of control right now and doesn't seem to be coming back down any time soon. any thoughts on this?
my biggest complaint about john hickenlooper has been that he's quite a bit cozier with oil and gas interests than i feel he should be, especially given recent issues such as the pipeline leak and subsequent explosion in frederick. how do you expect your approach to these groups to be different?
assuming you win the primary, how do you plan to reach out to conservative sections of the state like colorado springs?
what are your thoughts about nsa surveillance? federal reserve? edward snowden?
hi congressman polis, as a colorado resident, i am increasingly worried about the poor condition of the state's infrastructure. our roads are terrible and getting worse. how would you address our infrastructure as governor? best wishes on your campaign!
i'm 46 and current work for the city of denver and seem to have a similar outlook as yourself; i've been thinking about how to work toward running for public office. any advice based on your path?
hi mr. polis. thanks for stopping by my company (namaste solar) recently and supporting renewables in our state. my question is, do you have any plans to further reign in or eliminate tabor?
hey mr. polis. do you support free public higher education? if so, how would you plan to get there? single payer healthcare systems (if written better than last year's 69)? thanks!
good evening, mr. polis, from a fellow coloradan. others have touched on the issues of housing, transportation, and infrastructure - significant matters, of course. my question is a bit more narrow, but it relates to jobs and to something you should be rather familiar with. you and i both have a background in technology, and with the astronomical cost of living in silicon valley, many tech companies and qualified engineers and developers are starting to look elsewhere. places like the denver tech center, and boulder, are promising hubs of technical development and innovation here in colorado, and i'm optimistic that there is an opportunity for us in this area. my question for you is this - what thoughts do you have on growing the technology industry in colorado, and how can those of us already in it work to support this growth?
jared, how will you do more as a gov of co, than you have as a voice of reason in the house?
the democratic primary looks already to be a somewhat crowded field. what good things do you have to say about your opponents and how do you plan on differentiating yourself from the rest of the pack?
congressman, i'm a constituent in clear creek county. as a rural area, we have a lot of issues funding our school district, getting healthcare in the county, funding meaningful infrastructure repairs and upgrades, etc. my question is: how do you plan on addressing these sorts of issues in rural colorado as governor?
what are your thoughts on a universal basic income?
if you were a color combination in mtg, which would you be?
jared, in what areas would you like to see states have more rights over certain things rather than federal control?
where can i view your cnn special "freshman year" that you did with jason chaffetz? it seems to be gone.
jared, with the enormous amount of lakes, rivers and forests and large number of state parks and national forests and parks in your district and throughout the centennial state, what efforts as a member of the house of representatives have you made to protect the environment and balances that with the protection of property owners and what efforts would you make in the future to protect the environment while protecting property management/control rights by citizens of colorado?
what do you think colorado's most pressing infrastructure needs are? as governor, what infrastructure projects would you prioritize getting done? what did you learn as a tech co-founder that has helped you most as a politician?
don't you think that car sales tax in boulder is a little bit high?
what do you think of the question of whether puerto rico should be a state or not?
hey, i'm a member of your congressional district and i've always voted for you. how many times has your lol account been banned for flaming? secondary (serious question), 20 states now allow you to change the gender marker on your birth certificate without needing sexual reassignment surgery, but not colorado. will you support this and other trans rights policies if you are elected governor?
what are your thoughts on the transportation crisis for individuals with disabilities and our seniors?
submitted this at town halls but it didn't get picked: we've seen an increase from progressives in efforts to defend religious tolerance, but there's still massive cultural and governmental momentum to craft public policies based on the doctrines of a single religion. are there any parts of your plan for colorado that include bolstering research-based, evidence-backed decision making for state policies? sorry for the wide-ranging question, i know a lot of you goals are pro-science and pro-data, just wondering if religion-neutrality in government is something that's ever on your radar.
boulder county here. i'm glad to see you are running. my question is, do you think you can manage to not say something stupid every time you open your mouth like hickenlooper does? he continually makes me embarrassed that i voted for him. i have been saying for a couple of years now that i want a different democrat as governor.
considering you're only one of 7 openly gay members of congress right now, what advice would you give to other lgbt americans who want to get involved in politics and join congress?
jared, what are your thoughts on the tv show "south park"? in all seriousness, what could be done from the governors office and state congress in denver to help those 80 plus miles away in rural central colorado improve their area economically?
hey! german politics student here so i really appreciate it when politicians of any kind actually dare to openly ask questions like this. with trump resigning from the paris climate deal, soon news came up that governors and their respective states would "simply" bypass the white house's decision by pledging directly to the deal (i know this is vague as hell but it's 5:26 around here so please pardon me). so i guess my question is, what's your personal stance of the climate deal? how important do you think it is for the us and it's states to stay relevant in fighting climate change (and the opportunities we got at hand e.g. the paris deal) and how what's your expectation/hope for the next 4 years should trump stay in presidency? thanks in advance and good luck (or congrats) to your announcement and i hope you will rock it!
colorado has had a great windfall from marijuana taxes, but as other states continue to legalize the drug, how would you plan for a lower tax revenues, or do you feel the income will stay the same?
i'm curious about how strongly you're going to stand against fracking? this is one of the bigger issues that matters to me, and while your probably going to be the best candidate regardless of your stance on this but it will help consolidate my continued support in you, and possibly influence my parents as well. best regards, smaugthemagnificent
hi jared, as a fc constituent i'm so excited to see you're running for governer! what do you think you could do as governer to encourage development of and access to high-speed fiber broadband in colorado communities? hope i can get involved in the campaign!
beyond the traditional facebook/twitter platforms, how are you leveraging social media such as snapchat and instagram in your campaign? do you differentiate your efforts between fundraising and awareness/engagement? good luck!
can you make sure john elway stays the gm of the broncos?
hello, as someone who has an extensive background in entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and education, i was hoping you might have advice for my situation. i am starting a charitable non-profit that will provide a free security offering to consumers, including free incident response services. i would like to collaborate with universities to give aspiring security professionals an opportunity to get real-world incident response experience while contributing to a good cause and fulfilling a serious public need. without an especially strong personal network, the marketing aspects of the venture will be the most daunting aspect of the endeavor. but i ultimately feel it will be worth that hard work to do some genuine good in an area where there is no focus by others. given your own experiences, do you have any insight into how someone in my position could best engage the public, universities, and the government to raise awareness? thank you so much.
while it's exciting news that you're running for governor, there's so much more you could accomplish-- especially on modernizing congress with new technology and ideas. and with your position on the rules committee, a switch to a democratic majority could make you even more influential. what did you weigh in making this decision and what do you hope to accomplish before your congressional term ends?
i'm visiting colorado for the first time next week. any food recommendations in the denver metro area?
what do you think of the job of how the rockies are playing this year?
hey jared, used to be a colorado resident, voted for ya and i'm glad i did. thanks for your good work. here's a funny question for ya, i'm curious what you think: what do you think about the private military presence in colorado? i know of a couple bases/compounds/buildings that contain and or are housing military-grade equipment under private/corporate control. how do you feel about this, both specifically in colorado, and private military in general? and secondly, if i may, gene-editing technologies are moving much faster than government. what do you think government could do to contain or subvert the threat of biological warfare from non-state actors? is spying on citizens our best hope to stop this? it seems to have the largest existential threat to implementation-cost ratio.
jared, i named my fish after you. that said, what will you do to make colorado better (and college students specifically. i go to cu)?
hello congressman polis. i had the great pleasure of meeting you in fort collins to talk about immigration and daca issues a few months back. do you have any preliminary ideas about the things that you would do as governor to increase protection for immigrants in colorado?
are you at all concerned that giving up a democratic seat in congress could help to further this administrations insane polices?
hi jared, super psyched about your run for gov. we'll miss you in cd 2, but i guess we can share with the rest of the state! my question is on education. your plan for pre-k and kindergarten is awesome, but do you have anything in mind for funding the rest of k-12 and maybe even helping higher ed? growing up in a struggling district and then paying ever-increasing tuition for college, i feel this continuing underfunding of education is a growing issue that will hamstring our state economically for years to come.
constituent in northern colorado; have voted for you in each election. as governor, how will you support funding for higher education? as i'm sure you are aware, we benefit from an educated populace, but the cost of higher education keeps rising and pricing low-income qualified students out.
how come you congress people have the best health care coverage and you give us peons garbage coverage?
do you feel that if you don't do the bidding of the oil and gas industry that your livelihood will be jeopardized in some way? why is meeting the greed of corporations more important to you than the health and well being of the people you are entrusted to represent? 88 and 89.
hi jared, bit of a curly question for you: if you had absolute power over the legal system in the u.s., what laws would you immediately implement/alter/eliminate? thank you for all of your hard work, i appreciate it greatly!! --(constituent of yours in boulder)
any thoughts on former rockies manager walt weiss? he's an alumnus of my high school in ny :)
when you voted for the safe act in 2015 was that just xenophobia and bigotry or were you just engaged in some fear mongering to try and appear more moderate for this run?
do you support the middle eastern wars that america has been waging for the past 16 years? why or why not?
do you feel that the legalization of marijuana may create a disconnect between a child and parents? i ask because, in our day and age, it's becoming harder to get through to our children with the amount of media they are exposed to. so my concern is that if we legalize marijuana, that increased availability of the drug may make it increasingly harder to connect with our children.
we are doing some lane expansion on i-25 loveland to ftc we helped secure federal funding for it. but yes, we need to do a lot more. it also ties into the housing affordability question because people are being forced to live further from where they work- we can't let this hurt our quality of life it definitely has my attention and i will work with local governments and cdot to preserve what makes co special.
at least colorado is building, unlike other areas. oppose nimbyism at all costs.
i will be a fair referee for all parties, not cozying up or showing partiality to a particular interest over others.
i will be in colorado springs tomorrow as part of my announcement tour. i think that my message of an economy that works for everyone will resonate in every corner of this state. and republicans have kids and many want them to go to pre-k and kindergarten too!
i have voted and sponsored legislation on the side of privacy, reigning in the nsa and preventing warrantless wiretaps. i've always supported a full audit of the fed. never met mr. snowden. focused on running for governor to roll up my sleaves to make a difference, too much time in dc is spent debating rather than doing.
yes the state will need to go to the ballot box to see if voter's want to fund our 21st century infrastructure needs. we are growing and we need to catch up or or quality of life will suffer. let me know your ideas!
yeah that was kind of an instant classic. she also said that the worst day of her entire career is when i flew a hemp flag over the us capitol. glad she's gone. well i am doing this ama in a brewery and i don't want them to spit in my food so it's totally brues brews in pueblo :)
jesus, she did a terrible job there. like, they should use that tape to teach how not to give testimony/debate. yeesh.
i am actually touting namaste solar's co-op ownership model statewide, along with other employee ownership models like esops and stock options. how is the co-op ownership working for you as an employee? in answer to your question, yes of course i support finding a solution to tabor. specifically as governor, i will build a winning coalition (business, educators, republicans, democrats) to bring to the ballot a plan to establish full day preschool and kindergarten and invest in our schools.
i'm a sponsor nationally of the universal background check bill (i was last congress and when it is introduced plan to do so again this congress), and support common-sense gun safety measures.
i support single-payer health care nationally and if colorado moves forward it should make sure it is very well written and will work. the last thing we want is a failed system that leaves people in the lurch. i will be putting out more higher education plans over the course of the election about my specific plans to make college more affordable. i also tout dual-enrollment which allows students to get college credit and even an associates degree for free (or close to free) while they are in high school!
i had the ramen bowl and it was great. i love me some ramen. check it out sometime on the river walk. and tell me the real insider scoop on where i should go in pueblo!
they are all good and i wouldn't have any problem supporting any in the general. i know ed perlmutter and cary kennedy best. i've known and worked with cary for close to 20 years (more so in the early 2000s than recently). i work closely with ed in congress. i don't know michael johnson or noel ginsburg as well personally, i've met them but never worked with them professionally or spent much time with them. i look forward to getting to know them all better over the course of the campaign! they all seem to be good people and i look forward to hearing more about their ideas!
i'll have to look into that and ask cdot. the light rail system was build out largely from the fastracks ballot initiative in 2004 and i wasn't very involved with it (i was on the state board of education at the time)
health care in clear creek? consider yourselves lucky compared to summit and eagle. we need a colorado that works for everyone. for our cities, for our suburbs, for our rural areas. i support 21st century infrastructure including broadband, an education system including apprenticeships and skills, and encouraging employee participation in profits and ownership. we succeed together as a state and all three parts of my plan are statewide.
i try to avoid thinking of him, but since he is president i have had to. i think he is doing a poor job.
dude plains and mountain all the way, you get all the defense positions along with unlimited attack capabilities, not to mention a fuck load of trample
i have one archived on a flash drive, i'm sad they took it down. i thought it was still up. boy, jason and i turned out differently didn't we. but for both of us, this is our last session of congress.
well our main arteries i-25 and i-70 are causing the biggest problems for the highest number of commuters. i would base my priorities on an objective scientific analysis of traffic flow and where the biggest needs are! i learned a lot as a tech-entrepreneur that helps, mostly to be creative and disruptive and don't accept things the way they are just because they've always been that way
yeah if you want to volunteer sign up at polisforcolorado.com so we know who you are (we won't spam you too bad w emails, avg of 1/week a bit more as we get closer) but they will include volunteer opportunities. thanks for the reading recs, i won't have as much time to read as a candidate for governor but i do read on the plane back and forth to dc after i've done whatever work i need to do. glad you found the climate march invigorating, so did i! with the absence of federal leadership it's up to co and other states to lead the way which is why i'm proposing 100% renewable energy for co by 2040.
well one way or the other you will wind up with a different governor in january of 2019 (hick is term limited). with your help, maybe it'll even be me!
as governor, i plan to help colorado maintain a leadership role in the cannabis industry. we have many opportunities to continue to leverage our "first-mover" advantage into a ecosystem that allows us to continue our industry leadership. that being said, yes it's possible that sales will decline as ca and other states come fully online. currently after paying for regulation of marijuana most of the taxes go to school buildings in lower income areas- we need it. i will do my best to continue co's leadership role nationally even in the face of additional competition.
it's very important for rural communities to have broadband and high-speed fiber. i've been working on this federally and the state can and must step up too. i would like to see high-speed fiber as part of any infrastructure package. infrastructure ain't just roads and bridges. sign up at polisforcolorado.com so we know who you are and you can get involved :) say hi when you see me around
nope gov can't do that. i don't make pledges i can't keep ;)
great question! i have really enjoyed bring by best efforts to modernize congress. i've hosted hackathons, worked to open congressional information, and i also still have a year and a half left there so i'm not done yet! but my reason for being in public service is to make a difference, and i feel i can make a bigger difference by rolling up my sleeves at the state level and helping co lead the way in renewable energy, an economy that works for everyone, and education. and i can work on modernizing state government with new tech and ideas, and even though it's a smaller pond i'll be able to do more than as 1 of 435 members of congress!
what kind of food to you like? price range? food style?
i'd love some info and citations on the private military presence in co if you can post some. and yes, the threat of biological and nuclear threats from non-state actors is going up as technology develops. i won't have to worry about that as much as governor as a member of congress, but i will still try to see if there is anything the state can do to keep us safe.
because many school districts divert funds to early childhood, these funds would be available for other functions if we fund pre-k and k universally! so that's good! and of course i support more funding for our schools and to make college more affordable but only the voters of the state can provide that, not the governor :
dual and concurrent enrollment allow high school students to get college credit, even an associates degree, for free or close to free while still in high school! and more state funding for higher ed tied to reductions in tuition would also help.
i've spent some time with him and like him a lot. you also wouldn't want to mess with him he used to (maybe still?) do one of those pit-fighting things or something like that (more than just boxing, more street fighting or something). course whatever we're doing now under buddy black is working well!
neither one! i support expanding our refugee program and improving the vetting process
the question needs to be more specific. i have voted against continuing funding for troops in afghanistan as an example.
do you support expanding mass transit in combination? we don't need more roads per se, we need more efficient transportation alternatives.
that's funny. i always chuckle at loveland because i live in loveland ohio. hope to visit loveland co soon!
you mean you are selling our lanes and charging us for them.
is it possible to have a maximum amount allowed for rent on a 1bedroom apartment for single income housholds? one problem i see with rent is 1bedrooms are priced so high that people who don't have a spouse have to pay the same amount as couples. is there a way to make a housing program for single income families that would be similar to section 8? i pay 61% of my takehome just for rent. plus utilities, student loans, etc. saving for retirement is impossible. also how would sharing profits work for non-profit hospitals? thanks
so, your goal 'as governor' is to make companies in co decide to share profits and be employee owned? how, specifically, will you use the office of the governor to achieve this? i am very interested in you're candidacy, but this is a non-answer.
how? more laws? how much should the companies give?
i would ammend this by saying we shouldn't be building outwards. sprawl is a huge problem for colorado. we need to build more density rather than sprawling neighborhoods. when things go outward, it requires people to have cars, which require more roads, which hurt walkability and public transit, which means cars are required, which leads to traffic and air pollution.
if you're down here, you'd better have a plan to pay for widening i-25 from monument to castle rock.
any carrots you could offer them regarding gun rights? would you support repealing the unenforceable magazine restrictions passed a couple of years ago?
you don't need to meet people to form an opinion on their actions as you understand them. as i see it, he had no internal legitimate means of blowing the whistle. in my opinion, just because something is illegal, it doesn't mean anything about it's rightness or wrongness. what is your opinion on the actions of edward snowden as you understand them?
lots of carrots for the green energy industry. what about sticks for oil & gas?
how about a high speed train along the i-70 corridor? take a page out of the rest of the world and replace highways with trains, man. going from denver to grand junction in a fraction of the time? count me in.
utah has a great road system with many of the same challenges (freeze/thaw/snow) as colorado. perhaps we can use them as a template.
note that she's essentially bound by law to give the answers she did. not that this diminishes mr. polis's awesomeness here. poking at the ridiculousness on the system in such a direct way is amazing.
i appreciate the response. glad to hear you are interested in our business model. while i am not yet a co-owner (hope to become one next year), i wouldn't want to work anywhere else. the ability to have an equal voice/vote in the workplace is huge for a multitude of reasons. i feel more valued here than i have anywhere else, by far.
if you were running in ny, i'd vote for you 10/10 times.
what is your idea of "common sense gun safety measures"? because that's usually democrat speak for "punish law abiding gun owners by outlawing cosmetic features such as pistol grips".
i am an adjunct at acc in littleton. i'll be looking forward to reading your higher ed plans, and i hope you'll address ways to support access to low cost higher ed that also holds respect for and fairness to the contingent laborers that teach coloradans. dual enrollment is a great start! cheers!
so, if everyone has an associates degree, the value of the degree would diminish, no?
well, i'm glad we are on the same page. at least most of the country is haha. i'm a teacher, and i'm very concerned about betsy devos and the path that education is going. i'm a special education teacher, and i worry about cuts to medicaid and special education in general. what will you do to make it so that public education is not in jeopardy?
you certainly did turn out differently. thanks for your hard work and for being a good example. i'll tell my family in co about you.
so would you prioritize highway projects over public transit? and prioritize projects for commuters in general over other types of infrastructure (energy infrastructure, broadband, etc)?
people evolve and change their minds based on new data and social progress and pressure. what's the big deal? i don't hold it against anyone, as it's a sign of active intellect, instead of seeing new facts and doubling down and digging in with your previously held belief.
we will miss you. as someone who works on those issues at the federal level, there are few members of congress who match your energy and expertise and you will be tough to replace. i hope we can get a few more touchdowns before you (hopefully) become governor. this ongoing drain from congress of smart qualified members is a huge problem. not your fault, but boy do i wish we had a solution for it.
i'm not picky. i just always like to make sure when i'm on vacation i stop somewhere unlike what i can find in seattle.
since you're playing it that way... so you agree with donald trump that we need to improve our vetting process? what specifically do you find wanting in our current process? would you vote for a version of the safe act that was expanded to the list of countries in trump's travel ban eo?
yes transit options like bus and rail are a critical part of making our metro areas work!
hello other lovelander! loveland co is beautiful! we have one of the largest collections of outdoor public art in the country!
psst, wanna buy a lane? the need for these "public-private partnerships" (aka toll-high density vehicle lanes) is because we don't have the money on the public side unless the voters vote to give it to the state
well boulder is ~100k people and ~60k of those are students so, yeah... in boulder the school comes first. and all of the whiners should remember that without cu there would be no boulder. the school was founded in 1876 when there was no one living there.
are you saying that an increased housing supply is why housing prices has gone up?
imagine being a teacher with a masters degree, 5+ years experience not being able to live in the same neighborhood where you teach... throw in the being single dynamic, student loans, and ever increasing medical premiums, all while pension programs diminish!
get a room mate. price controls are unconstitutional in colorado.
want to make it easier and remove red tape and regulatory barriers for companies to do it. i've heard from several entrepreneurs who would implement employee ownership plans but compliance is too costly
oh i experienced that today. with an accident on it.
nationally in congress, i sponsor legislation to remove the special tax breaks that the oil and gas industry receives to the tune of $40 billion each year. eliminating these subsidies will help put renewable energy on a more level playing field.
no not law abiding gun owners, we are talking about people who are not legally able to purchase a gun but go around the law and try to by them and avoid a background check.
the degree represents a certification that a certain level of skill has been reached in whatever field it is in, and employers take that very seriously
no, it would just show you're more educated and have more expertise than a high school diploma holder. education is key to progressing as a society.
i am very concerned about that as well. i'm currently the ranking democrat on the early childhood and k-12 education subcommittee of the education and workforce committee, meaning i'm on the front lines of defending our public schools. i do have some good news for you: i do not expect any cuts in special ed funding! sadly i am worried about medicare (reducing eligibility reqs and throwing ppl off) and also other areas. so i'm doing my best to defend the federal investment in equity and education, but i can do even more at the state level for colorado.
if you want cliff divers, arcades, iffy mexican food, and decent sopapillas, go to casa bonita. better food: rock bottom, illegal pete's, hacienda.
trump does not have a plan that i am aware of to improve vetting, he wants to shut down our refugee program from a number of countries. i would support improving our vetting process-making it more efficient, quicker, and more thorough (yes we can do them all!) for refugees from all countries
this guy internets. love your votes on net neutrality. seriously isn't this a short term answer that's going to cause us long term issues?
could you please state your preference regarding public-private partnerships? if you are governor of colorado would we expect more of these, or would you try to guide the state to try to fund more fully public roads?
you missed my point and misunderstand the situation... these people are *taking advantage* of students, trying to *use* them to make more money by kicking families out of their homes. that is neither supporting students nor supporting boulder. i find it unethical and anti-social.
i know esops are all structured differently, but as someone who used to work at an employee owned business in co, this strikes me as a bit of an odd answer. typically aren't these business structures treated more as retirement savings/possible future payouts? they don't necessarily affect one's bi-weekly take home.
so you understand. i have a kid who will hopefully get her driver's licence this week. i'd like her to safely be able to get up to denver when she's asked to referee a game or wants to go tour a college. it would, of course, be nice for the rest of us too.
do you think that bringing more renewable energy to co will hurt the economic impact that the oil and gas industry has brought to us?
right, so what are the specific common sense gun safety measures?
yes, they do now. if everyone has one (say, like a high school diploma), don't you think that would change the way they view the degree?
your last point i agree with. however, if everyone has one, it won't mean as much. sure, you'll be slightly more educated than someone with a hs diploma. that said, it shouldn't be paid for by taxpayers.
my bad, i had no idea they were supposedly a multi-billion dollar company. and my stance is, why do you need such a big magazine as a civilian? i totally understand military needs, but not for civilian use, unless you're a bad shot :p
i will repeat the question since you ignored it. what specifically do you find wanting in our current process? and would you support a safe act now that added the other country's from trump's travel ban beyond just iraq and syria, the countries that you voted in 2015 to make fbi personnel personally sign off on? and how do you square what you said about making the process quicker and more efficient with a vote that then fbi director comey said would do the exact opposite?
it is because of tabor and voters that refuse to vote for increased taxes on anything. ppps are a solution to get something done.
i would hope that the voters would approve more free, public roads. public-private partnerships are a kind of last resort if the voters don't want to pay but we still need the roads
can you tell me where these families have been kicked out and which homes you're talking about. i genuinely don't know what you are talking about. i live at baseline and 35th and didn't see this anywhere close by.
when we're talking about 100% renewable energy by 2040, we are talking about powering he grid. light bulbs, computers, etc. so we are basically talking about the transition from coal to wind and solar. moving to wind and solar power does not directly impact the oil and gas industry in co because that oil and gas is processed and sold on the global market.
i sponsored (and will sponsor again) the bill for universal background checks and to close the "gun show loophole" nationally (colorado voters voted overwhelmingly to already lose it)
yes, they would be considered similar to a high school diploma. maybe not right away but over time. how about free education to only those people who need it? or free degree in a trade to encourage skilled workers? there is a middle ground but the state paying for kids who don't appreciate the schooling seems unnecessary. they'll just go because their parents made them and won't add value to the class or their education.
i am looking forward to casting a vote for jared polis for governor of colorado! if only we had more politicians such as yourself, i think the world would be a nicer place. i hope you feel appreciated, 'cause you are, very much. here's to hoping gov of co is a stepping stone to u.s. president :)
is this what happened with the bus lanes on 36? seems like they were pretty much done when we sold the toll rights to that australian company. and pushing the buses onto the shoulder to accommodate the deal? kinda crazy. big fan and am glad you're running!
well, that's funny because i used to live in your neighborhood (at the intersection of 39th and 38th, near where the bike path starts at the end of the frontage road), and in the 5 years i was there about 10 homes on my street were bought out by property management companies or wealthy individuals with cash flow that could out-bid young working families. obviously the owners had the option to stay, but when offered the choice of 30-50k above market value for a house that was built in the 1960's or staying in a neighborhood that's slowly turning into another college block, it's a no-brainer. it's difficult for young working families to buy houses in boulder for this reason, so they end up in gunbarrel, longmont, or lafayette.
a few years ago i ran across landlords who would not rent to me because i had a family. they only wanted students because they could charge them more.
if you don't see the problem it may be because you are part of the gentrification.
to be honest, that is not aggressive at all. 2040 is 23 years away. it should not take an entire generation to make a change. it should be more like a 10 year plan. not 25.
you do know there is no gun show loophole, right? gun show dealers require people to pass nics checks. i find it depressing that elected officials continue to believe this stuff. you're trying to legislate things you have very little understanding of and which are easily refuted with a quick google search.
doesn't sound like something a governor could touch. that sounds like a free market.
lol have you been to boulder? it always has been about as white as can be... there are no minorities to push out. get out of here with your bullshit.
you start the process now, create further incentives to speed it up later.
at some state levels, there is no gun show loophole. there is at the federal level, allowing some states to have it. yes, gun *dealers have to run background checks, but at many gun shows in "loophole" states, people get a booth who aren't a licensed dealer, just "selling guns person-to-person" thus don't need to run a background check. yet many of these people will sell many guns per show, and attend many shows. i bought my first two guns this way before my state closed the loophole, requiring all guns sold at guns hows to have background checks run. in both cases the person i bought the guns from had at least a dozen guns at their tables, and acknowledged that they have a table at that gun show every month. realistically, they are "gun dealers," they were just exploiting loopholes.
it is housing discrimination, and part of the affordability crisis in boulder.
gentrification is not limited to racial minorities; it pushes poor people out regardless of race. though in many cases (st. louis being a prime example) race and poverty intersect/overlap.
are you seriously crafting legislation based on wikipedia articles? gun show dealers have ffl licenses and make people pass background checks. the amount of people who commit crimes due to purchasing weapons at gun shows is practically negligible. again, you're trying to legislate something that doesn't even exist which means the only people who will be affected are law abiding citizens like myself. too often democrats have opined about "compromise" and in the end only took more away from law abiding citizens.
dude, where are located? i was diagnosed with an inoperable grade 3 anaplastic astrocytoma in 2015 at the age of 20. if you ever feel like talking with someone your own age that is going through a similar situation with brain cancer, please do not hessite to get in touch!! much love brother
what symptoms led you to go to the doctor when you got diagnosed?
wow... that's a lot to deal with so young. my mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer... i just wanna know what keeps you going every day? i'm worried for her and i want to do my best to keep her happy but i have no idea what to even say at this point.
i have two questions if you don't mind: how has this battle impacted your perspective on life? and ive heard stories about people being diagnosed that develop a bucket list mentality. do you have any kind of bucket list or have you made certain activities/goals more of a priority in your life since being diagnosed? thank you so much for your time. youre ability to continue the good fight is a testament to your inner strength and an inspiration to us all.
your bravery and willpower inspire me. what's your favorite form of creative expression?
as someone with brain issues (an injury, not on your scale) i'm keen to find out, how much have you found yourself pondering where your brain ends and 'you' begin, and how united or separate they are to you? i know before my injury i would've just said that my brain is basically me as a person, but with it failing in ways there are times where that really doesn't seem the case anymore. best of luck with the fight :)
do you ever feel like just giving up? i can't even imagine doing 53 sessions of radiation never mind everything else you've been through. it's seems like it would be kind of hard not to be fatalistic in a situation like yours. do you ever think one day you'll be in remission? sry if the question is kind of personal.
where are you now in your diagnosis? has your condition improved since?
do you find that you're less bothered by the little things in life now?
is there something that presses you on to keep living? 5 years sounds like a really long time to have cancer, i don't know about the cancer that you have, is it debilitating and you can't do a lot? are you missing out on going to school or anything? i read you do music.
what is your favorite activity and has that changed since your road to recovery??
from what i can tell, you seem to be a pretty happy/optimistic guy. were you always like this or was it something you had to work up to? is it hard to stay positive?
have you had any particularly stand-out good (or bad) experiences with your medical care?
what is the best or most memorable thing that a nurse ever did for you?
what is your fighting force to stay positive every day? much love and support!
i'm a vegan too! i always encourage all my friends who have any health issues to eat more vegan meals. i really believe what you eat can have a significant impact on your illnesses. what's your favorite vegan meal?
what is the worst part of chemotherapy? how did most of your friend/family react?
tried any potential alternative treatments or solutions?
hi richie, first, my best wishes are always with you. i hope you and your family are able to stay positive for as long as it takes, come what may. my dad was diagnosed with leukemia (m4) over a year ago and we ran pillar to post for 10 months. we went from a regular community level hospital from one country to md anderson, tx covering every possible level of hospital care and sophistication in between. and in our journey we came across other cancer patients who had their own stories. we lost our dad but we are left with this intense desire to do something, to improve those affected with cancer. we hope to act on this soon. have you thought of anything on these lines? do you any ideas you wish to discuss? or do you know anyone who is doing something like this? richie, i wish you all good that can happen, from the bottom of my heart. more importantly a shout-out to your family and friends who are in this together with you. always stay positive :)
ive heard of someone becoming severely mentally disabled after havint ear cancer due to the radiation this sounds funny asking, but how are you not severly mentally handicapped?
i knew i had two tumors in my brain two years before i had surgery, but the doctors hadn't been worried until 2012 when they started to grow. most of my symptoms were migraines, loss of feeling in my left side of my body, seizures, and mental fogginess.
the best thing to do is just keep her happy however you can. i see happiness as a medicine. it works for me and i believe it can work for her as well. be empathetic, but don't treat her any differently. make her smile and smile with her.
thank you very very much. i'm a musician, so writing music and recording it is my favorite.
the most memorable thing is from the surgery team, when i asked the doctor to take a picture of my tumor. instead, they filmed the surgery!
god honestly helps me stay positive. through this entire journey it was him that kept me going. in 2012 the moment i learned i was diagnosed with brain cancer, the first thing i did was thank god because i knew this would be for a reason.
i'm not really much of a bucket lister but i do hope to get married, have kids, and follow my music dream.
how did you find out that you had those tumors in the first place though? was it routine or did something happen to make you go have it checked out?
how can you be empathetic and not treat her differently? i have my own ideas, but what's your side of things?
i love music too. i've played the saxophone and took lessons for the electric guitar, and enjoy singing. do you like soul? who's your favorite musical artist?
this is a really weird question, but what did the craniotomy feel like afterwards?
would it be weird for me to ask you to post the video? (i do apologize if this makes you uncomfortable)
this very comment above me gives me so many more reasons why i should thank god daily....what amazing faith you have..
i noticed my comment got a load of down votes, i didn't mean anything bad by it or to offend you, sorry.
i had brain surgery in 2012, so my head was sore then. nowadays it's minor headaches.
were you awake when you were being operated on? and could you feel it happening? i'm asking because in movies when people get brain surgery they're awake and talking normally and i've always thought that was crazy. just wanna find out if it's like that in real life or not!
i can assure you that patients are not conscious during any kind of brain surgery. that would be horribly painful for the patient because many brain surgeries involve cutting into the scalp and removing part of the skull.
have you ever personally experienced homophobia and what was it like?
are you in any current relationship, and how is it? and you also mentioned about a service helping lonely elders in need, how much has this service offered for you?
alright, here's a good one for you. what do you want your legacy to be? how do you want the future generations to remember you when they inevitably come across this ama in the future?
do you have any racial preferences that factor/factored in to your dating, or was it never a consideration? as a blind man, what is your opinion of racial preferences in the gay community? do you have any other physical preferences like fat/thin, tall/short, etc.? the physicality of attraction seems to be a hot button topic in the gay community. thanks for your thoughts.
- what made you realize you were gay? - what is the first thing that makes you attracted to a man? his voice? smell? - what is your favorite food?
are there any blind lgbt resources or activity groups in your city? if not, maybe you can start one!
hello bob! i've noticed recently that there are many gays who feel lonely in their life, despite the fact we now have much more tools to connect with each other than your generation had. mental health issues are still a big problem among lgbt community, despite the fact that world is getting more accepting for us. i guess you've had a fair share of bad luck in life, if it is okay to say like that, but what is your fuel for life? what keeps you going? i read your story, thanks for sharing it with us! regards from finland, europe.
how did you write that note? checkmate. also how can you prove you're gay? checkmate2
i usually am pretty careful who i tell that i am gay. for me to be doing this ama is quite a big step but i'm hoping to make more contacts/friends. the one incident i had was i was walking with a sighted friend and holding his arm so he could guide me. i had my guide dog with me but i was holding his leash and not his harness. all of a sudden, some kids started yelling "fag, fag, fag" and began throwing bottles at us. my friend said "hey, my friend is blind!" as soon as they heard that, they stopped and apologized and one of them said, "i'm sorry - i thought you were a fag." that was the worst incident that ever happened to me. that was about 10-12 years ago.
(answering in order) i do not have any racial factors - race is not important to me. i judge people by somewhat intrinsic qualities - kindness, gentleness, people who are not afraid to hug, who are not afraid to touch in a kind way. those are the things that are important to me. i have no strong opinion on that except that i have no respect for someone who immediately dislikes someone because of their race i guess many people have preferences - some like heavy people, some like thin people. for me, i tend to like people who are on the heavy side but that is not always necessary. i tend to like people who are a little hairy, but again that's in no way written in stone.
i have a computer with speech and, as i type on the keyboard, it speaks what i have written. i was friendly with the person who edited bent voices (the website where the essay was posted) and he posted it for me. i can't but i am. how can you prove your sexuality?
damn that was hard to read. "hes gay get him!" "oh wait he's blind? that checks in with my morality, let him through boys."
i think you misunderstood. (or maybe i did) the kids thought they were gay because they were holding hands. once he said he was blind, the kids thought that he was not gay, and the holding hands was explained. so it wasn't that he was blind, it was that he had an "excuse" to hold a guy's hand.
he said that he was holding onto his sighted friend's arm so that he could be guided. how did you interpret that as they were holding each other's hands and used the blindness as an excuse?
gotta ask your reader the same question. sorry but now my curiosity is peaked about them.
arg. hard to word it. they were not using the blindness as an excuse. he was genuinely holding his hand to guide him. you are a random person, and see two dudes holding hands. most people would assume that they are a gay couple (as did this homophobic kid). but once you are told the one man is blind, you no longer have any reason to believe the man is gay, and just assume he is being led around (as did the kid).
for me, the most beautiful thing in the world is when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. meaning that when different things - people, materials, ideas, etc. - come together, they produce something of value, to them or to others, that is greater than they could have done alone. that's why i'm creating that service for seniors. there are people who need a good solution and people who want to work on meaningful things. why not bring them together and create something that enriches both of their lives? i'd want my legacy to be as someone who made such things possible. what would you want yours to be?
which was exactly the point of the person you claimed misunderstood.
you don't understand ama. why would people trust you to run a country?
no. 14 though... i was not expecting to find sense.
15 isn't exactly horrible either haha, if everyone has a bike then no one is stealing them lol
right, because that's when politicians make themselves available to the public. *after* an election.
what was it like being a woman doctor at a time when it was more unusual?
did you experience many preterm births? how did you stabilize these babies? did you transport them out by dog sled?
what's the farthest northern alaskan community you've been to? weirdest food you've tried?
do your grandchildren appreciate books like the hatchet, and pre-internet world they live in? do they appreciate that their gramma had those kinds of adventures?
amazing, indeed. my question(s): 1. how did you cope with having to abandon your country of origin? 2. what was life like after moving to the us? what challenges did you face, in terms of residency, job opportunities, finances and what not?
i did have preterm babies. i would deliver them and then keep them in a box in my office because we had no incubators in the villages. they would be 3 or 4 pounds. some of them died when they were born but that was uncommon. the nurses were really good, they would come into the office and check them all the time. since i didn't know how to use the preemie needles, i would give them transfusions and fluids through the bone, and would sit with them to make sure it didn't clog up the entire time it was in. in my hospital in tanana, half the 30 bed hospital was tuberculosis, 1/4 was women's ward for birthing, and 1/4 was for everything else. we would sometimes have so many kids in the hospital that we would have to put them in cardboard boxes or in the same crib, if they had the same diagnosis! medicine has come a long way!
the farthest i've been was barrow to visit. that's the northernest you can get! we slept under the plane we flew up in. the northernest place i worked was anaktuvuk pass, which was my favorite village. one native lady came in and had 3 babies in her parkie hood! anaktuvuk had so many pregnant women... it kept me busy! the weirdest food was probably walrus. it was so gummy and thick. not very appetizing!
that's awesome, i want to visit barrow. kotzebue is the farthest north i've visited. what time of year were you there? have you tried muktuk (whale blubber & meat)? if so, is it similar?
i was in barrow on 4th of july weekend... we couldn't sleep very well with the sun out all day and night! i have had muktuk... it did taste similar to walrus but was better tasting. i still didn't really like it all that much.
they also used to just cut off pieces of whale and eat it raw as a snack. i never joined that tradition!
did you ever use native herbs/plants for curing ailments?
to each member of the animation team, which character from camp camp was your favorite to create and continue to develop? also thank you to all the members of the 2d animation team, camp camp is one of my all time favorite shows
hey guys, big fan of your work. i was curious when it comes to discussing the concepts surrounding new shows (like setting it in a camp, or following a rock band) how many people play a part in that process as it evolves? looking forward to seeing more from you guys!
how is the relationship between the writer and the animators in terms of communication? is the script up for change on the day or do you usually stick to it?
what has been your favourite complex shot to plan then eventually animate?
what was your favorite episode of last season to work on?
are there any ambitious projects you almost gave up on, but stuck it out solely because of spite?
first of all amazing job with camp camp its incredible. and my question is who is your favourite character and why is it space kid?
how long does it take, from brainstorming to release, to create one episode of the show? also, please release the animatics from season 1!
hello rt animation team! thanks so much for doing this ama! firstly, how many people do you hire on (full time or contract) from discovering the fan work they've made? be it fan art, fan animations, fan music/remixes, etc. and secondly what creation have you contributed to within rt that you're most proud of? thanks a ton!
are there any features or memories of camps you went to as a kid that you've subtly incorporated into scenes of camp campbell?
this may have been asked before, but who was the hardest character to write?
hey rt 2d team! what programs do you use for shows like camp camp & x-ray and vav? toonboom? adobe animate (aka flash)? what does your timeline/production pipeline look like per episode? context: i work in 2d animated children's content and we've recently completed a whole show using adobe character animator & doing more advanced animation within after effects. i did the animation/editing, my boss and his wife did the voices and we completed a 15 episode (roughly 7-11 minute long episodes) 'show' in 4 months. i've never worked in a proper animation pipeline, i'd love to hear how rt operates!
when you decided to become an animator, who inspired you to animate?
do the team members roles ever cross over into each other? (ex. one of the writers being involved in character design, an animator pitching story ideas, etc.)
what is your favorite moment from the season 1 and season 2?
have you ever hid easter eggs in scenes that nobody ever found? like the alien on south park sort of thing.
if i wanted to hire a decent freelance animator to make a 90 second short, what should i pay them? what should they charge?
who would be your dream voice actor for a new character next season?
sex swing was understandably not for everyone, but i absolutely loved it. i just wanted to say congrats on that show, it was fantastic, and weird, and great. are there any fun collaborative plans you have for the other arms of rooster teeth for the future? even on just a personal level, who do you really want to work with?
what episode this season was the hardest animate? what was the hardest last season?
when creating the characters which one went through the most changes while the series was being worked on?
with the positive reception of season 1, has that given you more confidence/freedom in putting forward ideas and stories this time around? and has your approach changed at all compared to before?
if you had to add a new permanent camper into camp campbell, what would their hobby be?
what's something that no one has asked you about but that you're dieing to talk about?
what tv/movie monster do you guys think will be the most probable to attack camp campbell? and the most probable to attack your offices?
i absolutely loved the end of that episode! props to the whole animation team! can we expect more songs in this season of camp camp?
how has moving into your own building changed the department? do you miss being in the thick of everything at the main rt building?
in a time in which anti-semitism is on the rise, particularly here in the u.s. and over in europe, why do you guys think it's funny to make anti-semitic jokes such as the entire episode last season, and the gas chamber jokes this year? as someone who is jewish, i don't find it funny especially given that most of the people who do find it funny are anti-semitic.
jc: we try to limit ourselves to one musical number per season (they're really difficult to make x_x) mt: one thing to look forward to musically is new songs from richie branson in the end credits for every episode! so stick around chumps!
all: we appreciate your point of view and definitely try to take these thoughts into consideration whenever we approach any piece of content. we'd rather acknowledge the darker parts of the world than ignore them and let them fester. we don't think that any jokes are presented in a way that condones any type of hate. we're not trying to normalize the outrageous but sometimes we'll use the outrageous to demonstrate how ridiculous a character's thinking or motivations are. thank you for giving us an opportunity to address concerns such as these.
in the proposal, you have mentioned that "similar carter center projects have eliminated river blindness from four countries in the americas and from parts of uganda and sudan", how is this project different from those ones and what challenges do you anticipate with nigeria?
what would you do with the $100 million from the macarthur foundation that you are not already doing?
1) what inspired this idea of yours? why nigeria? 2) did you apply for any other challenges? 3) what do you think your chances are of actually winning?
why community volunteers rather than paid employees?
do you really think this can be accomplished in 5 years?
hi. given that you have experience in eradication programme (guinea worm, oepa) and uganda, how do you plan to implement this when you get the funding?
will $100 million be sufficient to implement the programme? if not, how will tcc fund the gap?
what do you think makes this project stand out against the other semi-finalists?
has tcc successfully assisted with the elimination of the transmission of river blindness in other countries?
what are the risks associated with implementation? what could go wrong?
hi! i'm a big fan of the carter center and the work that you all do! what led you to your current position and program? what is the most unexpected or exciting you've learned or discovered while working with river blindness?
how will you assess areas that where previously classified as not requiring treatment?
hi dr. richards. your work in the americas and with river blindness around the world is very impressive. what are the program differences between "elimination" and "control"? is one easier than the other? thanks for doing this! i'm a big fan of tcc
what books did you read to get where you are now knowledge-wise?
you said that its good with hardware, have you put it onto a mobile device to see how she performs? make stephanie completely mobile using one of the python applications. sorry if this is already answered, that was one hell of a wall of text.
would you be worried about "stephanie" going back in time to the 80'same and killing john connor's mother?
first and foremost, great job on your project. what do you need to learn in order to build something like this? i'm currently at the stage where the basics of python is already familiar and have used a bit of numpy and pandas for data analysis.
so what's next in store for you? what do you do right now except for making projects? i went through some of the documentation, but i didn't see anything about automation? was that intentional? or are you going to put something in it later? why not college?
i have wanted a privacy focused concierge that is completely loyal to me, ever since i lost track of technology. what should i need to accomplish this?
this is really amazing. good job mate, i'll definetly look into it (both source code and the apis). i'm a self-taught as well, even though i didn't really read any book yet (but did read lots of interesting stuff around the internet), now working as a python programmer. how did you come up with the idea of open sourcing it? i think a simple yet powerful open source assistant is really something amazing to work on as an open source project and i will try to read and understand the code in my free time. also, if i may ask, how old are you? you look pretty young from the pictures (maybe you already stated it somewhere but i didn't notice)
as a self taught, how you managed to get a programming job? i started this year to learn programming (live in brazil, programming in python) and i decided i really want work with this but i don't want and can't go to university so...my question is more regarding to python and self taught aspect of 'getting a programming job'.
before moocs, what kind of education did you have? how did you break into moocs? i can't seem to have the discipline to finish a coursera or edx course! how can i accomplish this?
awesome! what language do you think is the best to learn as a beginner? i used to code visual basic 6 , over 10 years ago as a teenager, and i have a hard time grasping the thought of programming with 'no interface', ie buttons and such that actually 'create a program' that you can launch from your desktop? i want to code a simple search engine for amazon - that allows me to search amazon from my own interface; do you think this is best done in python?
thank you! you need to have a solid understanding of fundamentals and few design patterns after that you can easily look up the documentation of various packages and integrate them as needed. but yes more often that not you need to create your own package because of it's unavailability, and the architecture of the application is really important if you wanna create something stable and efficient! that's why design patterns are amazing to get hold off, after that you need some imagination and some creativity? sounder algorithm for instance, i had to research about nlp in order to come up with an idea, some solid principles of mathematics doesn't hurt either!
how long it took you to get a python job? was it difficult?
ugh i hate python!! normal languages prevent you from making dumb mistakes, and python will let you compile them! /rant. i just started learning python too :) i have yet to understand why people are in love with it. something like java or c# is just so much more... powerful.
can you elaborate your first sentence? the last time i used c was back in high school and i've only dabbled in languages other than python.
do you spend an inordinate amount of time explaining to people that ufos are not necessarily space ships from planet x and that they are actually, in fact unidentified flying objects?
what is the strangest thing you discovered in your research?
what would you most like to tell us that no one has asked about yet?
has anyone told you that you look like steven spielberg?
is there one incident in particular that you can point to that justifies your belief in something "very real" going on? also, what's your favorite piece of baseball equipment?
thanks for doing this ama. most people think ufos actually are identifiable and belong to the us government. what is something about ufos that most of us would be shocked to find out?
hi mark, i must admit i haven't read your book though this is a topic that has interested me quite a bit after witnessing ufo's in the past. i remember dr. hynek from various documentaries i've seen where he publicly denounced ufo's in his interviews as a front man and skeptic for the military, was there a pivotal moment or particular case that changed his beliefs? you mentioned that you have come to share his beliefs that the phenomenon represents 'a new aspect of reality', do you mean simply by the existence of extraterrestrial life, or that it underlies another dimension of our reality itself? thanks and best of luck with your ama!
how did your perspective on ufos change (or not) during the time you spent researching the book?
who is your favorite sister-in-law? (just kidding) where could i learn more about how another dimension or vibration may be the explanation of unidentified flying objects?
which tracy brother from the hit show thunderbirds do you think would be most helpful in the event of an alien invasion?
what is your favorite depiction of aliens in movies/tv/books?
have you personally ever seen a ufo? or do you know anyone personally who has?
what's your favorite story about hynek that didn't make it into the book?
how does your experiences and knowledge conflict with or confirm your spiritual beliefs and what kind of affect has it had on your thoughts on death specifically?
is there anyone presently in the ufo related field who you feel is doing particularly excellent scientific work?
if we can get a person on mars, how do you think we'll do it?
i think it is fair to say that ufo research as a field has a credibility problem in many people's minds. is there something you feel people should or shouldn't be doing to attract the right/avoid the wrong kind of attention?
are there certain parts of the world that have either a greater number or more believable reports of ufo sightings than others?
hi mark, thanks for taking the time to do this ama. i will definitely check out close encounters man. sounds awesome! thanks again. onto the questions: 1. what would you say has been the most hair raising thing you or dr. hynek found out while researching ufos or reports? 2. do you believe in the men in black stories or think they're just made up to add fuel to the whole ufo / aliens phenomenon?
where did you get that thing on your shoulder? if i remember correctly, it's from an episode of twilight zone (though it may have been outer limits). that scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid.
have you been inspired while writing this book to do some ufo hunting yourself??
hi, thanks for this ama, do you think ufos can be us humans from the far future?
hello sir, what's your favourite film genre ? favourite movie/director?
aren't alien abductions actually black op mind control experiments?
i'm very surprised to see this book here -- one of my favorites -- thanks for doing it! i really enjoyed the book's depictions of interactions with law enforcement. where did the inspiration for sheriff mason mckinley come from? was he a composite character, or really someone from past experiences?
yes, that is pretty much unavoidable! people always ask the wrong questions.
that steven spielberg accidentally stole the title of "close encounters of the third kind" from dr. hynek
the tremonton, utah movie film from the late 1950s is pretty convincing evidence that something real was seen. catcher's mask, hands down
that many ufos seem to be both physical and non-physical at the same time
definitely along the lines of another dimension or another vibration, if you prefer... something that our science may never be able to xplain!
well, that's a trick question you see... i'm not sure if "scientific" work applies to ufo research anymore!
didn't we already send matt damon? seriously check out the work of robert zubrin. he's got it all figured out!
that is an excellent question! a number of respectable ufologists have put considerable time into studying this very thing, and while there are unquestionably geographical trends that appear from time to time, they never seem to amount to anything. there's a great story about the government apparently having such data and using it to predict a sensational ufo event in the 1950s, but i have found no way to prove or disprove the story.
my brother matt & best sister-in-law casey got for that for me for my birthday a while back. it is a "zanti misfit" from the outer limits, and it's scary as hell!
some of them likely are, but beware of making blanket analyses... that's what gets most ufologists into trouble.
i have no idea who "sheriff mason mckinley" is. can you elaborate?
lol, myself included! thank you for your work and open mind.
i have read some claims that steven spielberg's inspiration for close encounters of the thrid kind was based on actual events of a scheduled visit of aliens to pick up a selected group of humans to live on their world for a few years. what are your thoughts on this and do you think it's real?
what about leslie kean's books? i think she rounds up the best possible evidence.
can you expand on that a little? when you say non-physical, you mean like those beams of light that car dealerships shine at the night sky?
in other words, there is definitely stuff flying around up there. there is proof enough of that. we just dont know what these things are or what they are made of. it could be aliens. it could be interdimensional matter. it could even be ghosts. or not. it could really be anything you could imagine at this point.
not sure what you mean by that. i can take it two different ways: 1) there's no one credible doing ufo research at the moment, only crackpots 2) we know what we can know for now, so ufo research is now more like philosophy. are either of those what you were thinking?
do you suspect any one on earth is an extraterrestrial?
meaning the government (supposedly) actually predicted a ufo event? did they warn the public?
hmmmmmm.... just what a ufo troll *would have to say...*
i can take a better picture with a $50 camera than i have ever seen of an alien ship in 80 years of ufo reports. is there one pic out there that has any credibility, sharpness and focus?
yeah, he is a man of mystery i suppose. it is better that you don't explain.
this is an enduring and intriguing part of the ufo narrative. i know of no evidence that it's true, or that it's untrue. if it were true, i think mr. spielberg would have been on the first ship.
leslie's ufo book is a must-read! her newest book, surviving death, is also mind-blowing...
photos of ufos generally suck, which i think is deliberate. someone posted a youtube link below to the tremonton utah ufo movie, and that is worth watching
knowing the insane powers of liberal hollywood, it doesn't surprise me
what do you think is the best evidence in that book? it seems to me the ex-military people have the most credibility.
i love the books by sergej lukianenko. apart from that i think metro 2033 is pretty amazing.
when you say deliberate: deliberate by who? assuming you don't mean the photographers, what motivations would you ascribe to extraterrestrial creatures making themselves visible, but only in a crappy way?
yeah i think they suck because every abduction is mind control or a hoax. i don't think the fuzzy multiple lights is a great example.
the military's top photo analysts said they were absolutely not birds. or balloons.
it's a paradox. millions of us carry cameras with us pretty much 24/7. you'd think we could blanket the sky and we still can't decent photos of ufos.
not to be rude, but did he/she explain why they couldnt be birds or balloons? honest question.
not rude at all. gimme a minute and get you the page # in my book.
i wish he'd share cooler tech with us, though. what's he saving the good stuff for? i'm talking limitless clean energy, immortality, the works!
yeah i kept thinking "man, im no expert, but i cant see how anyone could tell that these arent birds with the poor video quality." they even follow a flight pattern that looks like a flock migrating.
he does have 5 boys and two are twins and 3 are triplets.
a question to another topic: how did you come to write for startrek?
what would you say is the biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization? what would you say is the biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization?
what are the conditions you most often prescribe for in pa?
what are your thought about long term effects on intelligence. and has cannabis measureable short term effects on intelligence during the consumption? in short: do people really get stupider when you are high?
i'm a sarcoidosis patient with muscle/joint pain and some reduced lung capacity. are there medical marijuana treatment options that may be suitable?
i am dealing with an auto-immune related inflammatory condition and have been through so many different medications and treatments, with not much success or relief from my constant pain. i have been waiting for the medical marijuana law to be passed in pa and now that it has am now waiting for it to be implemented. how do i start the process for applying for medical marijuana or finding a doctor that is willing to try it as a treatment? is your practice in pa anywhere near york? i have also been debating changing doctors as well and don't know if that might bring in new eyes to my conditions and maybe new treatments. do you think it is wise to stay with my current doctor (6 years now) or is there benefit in doctor shopping when dealing with a chronic illness that has no cure?
how long do you think it will be before marijuana is legalized all over the us? i suffer from chronic pain in a state where marijuana isn't legal, which sucks.
what are the hardest challenges you face working with something as "controversial" as marijuana, do you ever find people who think less of you (either in general or as a doctor) because you have chosen to work with pot?
i have a mild form of epilepsy that mostly causes me to experience panic attacks in fear that i will have a seizure more so than actually having seizures. in your opinion would medicinal cannabis help combat this panic during flare ups or would it worsen the situation with potential episodes of paranoia on top of the panic attacks?
i tried 3 strains of medical marijuana. i one a cbd sativa one a thc indica and the last a hybrid. i have all of them and they put me to sleep and seriously groggy the next day. is there any that will not leave me sleepy?
what is the greatest benefit of using marijuana shown by research and do you have links to any of this research? curious to read more about studies that have shown benefits.
illinois resident checking in! thinking about going to get my license soon, if it's possible. i have been on and off dozens of anxiety and depression medications for the last five years. all of which either only worked for a short time or had horrendous side effects. because i don't want to rely on highly addictive anxiety drugs the rest of my life (in my 20's) i would really want to try some tinctures or edibles. i do not want to get high or smoke, i just want some relief. do you think medical marijuana could help me? and if so, what strain/method of consumption would be best for me?
live in maryland, which is attempting to set up a medical marijuana market. what has and hasn't worked for the pa and de programs?
is smoking marijuana as healthy as other methods like pill or edible form?
have you ever heard of retnitis pigmentosa (rp)? it's a retinal disorder that causes night blindness and eventually legal blindness in a small percentage of the population. i'm asking because i've seen 'studies' done that say marijuana can improve night vision and wanted to hear your thoughts on it. even something that seems insignificantly small to you could be the difference between me feeling comfortable to leave my apartment at night or not. thanks for your time and keep up the great work!!
what are your thoughts on using marijuana recreationally for someone with a mental illness? i have bipolar disorder and usually whenever i ask i get mixed messages. some people say go for it, others are very against it. thank you!!!
do you believe that a national legalization of recreational marijuana will offer more benefits than consequences? some potential negatives is that it might seem like the government is telling everyone that doing drugs is okay and that it might encourage the legalization of harder drugs (i.e., how do we know when we're crossing a line, is there a line?). some positives that come to mind is that it could bring about an entire industry out of the 'black market,' so to speak, and lead to the creation of potentially thousands (maybe millions?) of jobs -- and as a result, more tax revenue for the government? furthermore, if you don't mind me asking, how do you weigh the 'potential' pros and cons as an individual vs. being a physician? is it even possible to separate the two now? :p thanks :)
dr. roman, why do you think the more conservative areas of the usa like the southeast, midwest, mid-south, southwest and great plains states have governors and state legislators that are so opposite to medical marijuana laws for their own state?
dr. roman, what do you think of the situation in california where doctors will give a prescription for almost any ailment and condition?
dr. roman, related to the science of the brain why are psychologists and mental therapist opposed to their patients using marijuana?
dr. roman, what are the positive or negative affects of marijuana with the conditions of tinnitus and visual snow? how are hearing and visual problems affected in a negative or positive way?
dr. roman, have you made any efforts to lobby to change the federal laws about marijuana?
the biggest misconception about using marijuana as a potential treatment?
i once saw a program where someone with tourette and many ticks got medicinal marijuana. he was so calm after that but still functioned well. so my question: if you would use medicinal marijuna long enough, would it reduce the symptoms when you lower the dose over time to 0? (sorry for my bad english)
could medical marijuana have side effects such anxiety and paranoia in someone who experiences this smoking it?
what do you do if people are looking for a medical card, and seem to have nothing wrong with them? is it awkward telling them they're not qualified to receive a card?
would i get turned down if i wanted to be treated with cannabis for ptsd that was induced by another drug? i had a really, really bad acid trip a few years ago, and it has given me some very clear ptsd symptoms. cannabis has been the only thing thats helped. i refuse to take addictive anti depressants or pills alike. im just worried that ill get denied due to the cause of said ptsd. it has been 3 years, and the symptoms persist. the anxiety, the fear, the triggers, the nightmares, its all too real. please help!
apparently the bots in this subreddit think anything without a question mark isn't a question? so here's a repost of my question? if you're still around and have any experience with this, can you share your thoughts on cbd oil (or other forms) as a treatment for fibromyalgia?
does medical marijuana help sufferers of anxiety? if so is there a specific kind the person of anxiety must use?
the biggest myth perpetuated by those who advocate against marijuana legalization is that there is not enough research to use it on patients. the biggest myth perpetuated by those who are for marijuana legalization is that it has therapeutic benefits far greater than research would suggest.
it's a mix between cancer, autism, seizures, ptsd. this is only for pediatric patients, however. there is no way to approve adults for marijuana yet but access should be available by spring of next year, which is fast, imo.
i believe that people do get slightly stupider when they are high. i don't think it's very significant though and most of it centers around the short-term memory loss. in the long run, i think it may be beneficial for intelligence. it certainly won't increase it, but i think there is a protective effect on brain cells and the mind and i certainly don't believe any decrease in intelligence occurs from long-term use. cigarettes and alcohol on the other hand...
talk to your own doctor first, if you feel comfortable with that. then, if they are not applying to be a registered cannabis physician in pa, call our office (855-420docs, or 844-4pa-weed) sometime in the fall when we're closer to the medication being available and we will touch base with you then about the most recent regulations and policies concerning attaining a medical marijuana card.
thc in itself can cause that sleepiness or couch-lock effect you're describing. move towards a much higher cbd, or pure cbd oil and you'll likely find yourself not groggy.
i'm not so sure it would be very beneficial to you without the feeling of being high. from my experience treating patients with similar symptoms, it's the psychoactive constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) that has the most therapeutic effect. therefore, i think you should reconsider the possibility that getting high may actually be beneficial to your psyche. take this all with a grain of salt cause without a proper doctors visit with me such recommendations are generalized and may not be true to you or another reader since it is so individualized, this treatment.
i don't think that this is going to be helpful. i've never read anything on this and can't even think of a mechanism by which that could happen. that's my initial impression.
optometry student here, so take everything with a grain of salt (also none of this is medical advice.): i've never read anything to suggest marijuana can treat rp. studies have shown vitamin a to be helpful in slowing the progression. also i believe some form of "bionic eye" was recently developed? and as far as long term... i know the goal is to eventually develop gene therapy that will allow us to overwrite the gene causing rp with a correct version, which would ideally "cure" the disease. hope that helps :)
i definitely believe that marijuana should remain medical. i also believe it should not require a doctor to get and should be available to anyone in need of it. i call that "over the counter medical marijuana." there have been no significant problems with recreational legalization in many individual states now so i think we can say that the same would hold true if the remaining states legalized. the pros and cons are really the same regardless of who i am "being." personally, i usually remain in the same (mind)frame regardless of circumstances so that question doesn't apply to me much.
getting high is separate and not necessary for the herbs therapeutic benefits.
i agree with them and add the caveat that a small amount of people suffer a relatively mild addiction and withdrawal compared to those experienced with traditionally addictive medications.
not nearly as much as i thought. the medical community is starting to appreciate what i do and doctors are gaining respect for me for doing what i do and going out of my way to help people. the board of medicine has no issue with what i'm doing. do i feel that my license is at risk for doing what i do? yes. i feel that there are areas of medical marijuana that are controversial and i do feel that my license could be taken one day for this. that's what may come with the responsibility of being a pioneer in this and i accept it and expect that if it does happen by then i can move on to non-clinical roles like i always planned. i don't think that doctors need to worry about medical boards as long as they are careful. i believe in ketamine as a therapeutic drug for pain, yes. it works. it is not simple to administer, however, and is very controversial still. i don't do it myself, nor do i plan to. i've got enough on my hands with mmj.
yes. that is not uncommon in patients with ibd. it sounds like you at least have response to medical marijuana, which is not true for everyone.
can you give a few examples of the common types of claims that are being exaggerated for the purposes of advocating for marijuana legalization?
fellow physician here. (pediatric psychiatrist) i'm trying really hard to understand your position - in another place you commented that the benefits are oversold, and yet i see you speaking about treatments for autism (miniscule evidence in kids), seizures (mild evidence), ptsd (mild evidence in adults, almost none in kids) in kids! are you an evidence based physician?
longitudinal studies pretty convincingly show that regular use decreases iq by about 6-7 points (not huge), and that stopping regular use returns iq to previous state.
is this a common question? i struggled for a long time until i figured this out. thank you for your quick response!
i was using oil that is 18%cbd and 0.7%thc. still sleepy. guess it won't work for me.
thanks! what i meant by "person vs. physician" was how do you weigh the pros vs cons in determining whether recreational marijuana should be legalized. like, did you prioritize certain benefits/negatives after becoming a doctor than you did before (i.e., did med school and/or becoming a doctor change your views on marijuana legalization?)? that's what i was trying to get at :)
what about the symptoms when i go off, are mj withdrawals real?
you know that guy that has end-stage "parkinson's disease" up until the point when he takes a few puffs of cannabis and suddenly he's a normal person? or, the rick simpson oil peddlers claiming it cures cancer. these are two that come to mind.
not exactly the way you worded it, no. yours had a nice over-medication spin on it.
you don't think it could have anything to do with the perverse incentives to prescribe pharmaceuticals?
i used to consider marijuana to be about the same as alcohol.... good for enjoyment, but not really medically good for anything. ....then i met a girl with epilepsy. the fact that she literally upset her entire life and moved to be able to access medical marijuana for her condition and the fact that it has allowed her to (mostly) attend university "normally" changed my mind. how is medical marijuana **not even considered** as treatment for cases where is proven to be effective?!
as a canadian physician who receives no drug incentives whatsoever and makes no more money if i use medications with my patients or not... nope.
as a person that is usually very evidence based, we need to keep in mind that the generations old war on drugs has severely impacted the research in this field. i am not advocating for marijuana over western medicine at all, but when all else has failed, there is no harm in trying alternate solutions if they are not going to be harmful.
iq tests are certainly an objective measure of something. whether or not that something is intelligence is the grey area. this is why assessing iq is "very loose". calling it an "intelligence quotient" without even knowing whether its measuring intelligence sounds pretty loose to me.
that makes sense, but it could be a factor in the response op receives from american psychiatrists.
his hatred for the hoedown is unquestionably eternal.
from what i've heard, it's because he always had to go last. considering that hoedown was usually one of the last games played in an episode, it put a lot of pressure on him to close out the show with a big laugh.
somewhere in the 90's there was a chicken disease in belgium, my country, and millions of chickens had to be slaughtered. it ended up as a faits divers in international newspapers. a chinese family friend's wife, in china, stopped buying chickens for months. even though there was no chicken export from belgium to china. plus, the belgians just slaughtered them all. no export anywhere. anecdotal as fuck, i know, but many chinese are so irrational and superstitious, especially the ones buying things like rhino horn, that i feel that's your best entry to alter their behavior. spread rumors of horn or ivory contaminated with radioactive material to aid in tracking them by satellite but causing leukemia.. stuff like that.. what do you think?
what was the hardest part of being undercover? when undercover were you ever found out?
probably a stupid question, but what was it like working at interpol and how did it compare to working as an undercover cop?
why do governments destroy shipments of seized ivory? wouldn't it be better to sell it, and reinvest the earnings into prevention?
what does the day-to-day of your job consist of? are you trying to stop the people hunting the rhinos or more catching the people selling them far after they're dead, or all in between?
have you been in many/any life threatening situations? what's the scariest one you can remember?
does trophy hunting help fund elephant conservation?
eve of uk election - thoughts on dropping banning of ivory trade from particular manifestos?
if you found a lamp, would you rub it and kind of hope it was a magic one? if a genie popped out and granted you three wishes, what would they be? if the magic part was that after vigorously rubbing the lamp instead of a genie popping out, the lamp would reach orgasm, would you be happy that you had found a magic lamp or disappointed that you had gotten a lamp off, and presumably were now covered in lamp cum?
i have like a friend who is like wanted by interpols how can he avoid getting busted? and what do you think of the situation in venezuela?
will we get any benefit from interpol after brexit?
have you ever ran out of toilet paper, but only realised after you pinched one off? if so, what was your next move?
no questions are stupid! the difference is chalk and cheese. interpol are not cops. its simply an organisation which tries to facilitate cooperation between countries. interpol staff have no powers, no investgative capabilities and no jurisdiction (unless they are seconded police officers working within theor own jurisdictions). it's a rather lumbering bureaucratic organisation, which does the best job it can given its limited remit. compared to being an undercover cop, it was much less exciting, but much more interesting if that makes sense?
maybe, but then are we not encouraging the concept that ivory as decoration or status symbol is acceptable, and perpetuating this ideal?
it seems like the ideal is already there, otherwise there would be no demand for it now. plus, we still display ivory in museums and antiques
the same as we would any other crimnals - with some hard graft, and an investigative bent. lots of the countries i work in however, make doinf seemingly simple stuff very difficult - so much like a drugs investigation, identify the hierarchy and target them using simialr methods, but as i say its bloody difficult!!!!
are you in fact a living pez dispenser or jimmy neutron all growed up?
hi jordan! love your work on the daily show what's a typical day working on the daily show like for you? when they're shooting an episode that you're not in, are you still there lurking around backstage, or do you just get to stay home and watch netflix that day or what?
why did you settle on guns for the topic of your special? personal experience, outside influence, the fact that it's so hot right now?
hello jordan, i like your work on the daily show :) my questions are: 1. what was the most dangerous experience you and the crew had while shooting (pun intended) the special? 2. do you think apple making its gun emoji into a water gun emoji will help solve guns?
unrelated to guns, do you have a favorite daily show piece you've done so far?
why didn't you reach out to popular gun rights personalities such as dana loesch, colion noir, john lott, etc. about common ground?
hi jordan, really been enjoying your work on the daily show, and my question is what is your favorite on location shoot that you've done for the show?
is it true that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun shoot him?
is there a difference between our gun crisis and our violence crisis? it seems that shootings may be the result of an underlying problem. in europe, murderers are weaponizing motor vehicles by driving into crowds. is there really an underlying cultural, economic crisis?
" i even try to convince my own cousin to give up his shotguns" if this isn't an anti-gun special, why did you do this?
each day is pretty unique, depending on the days news, if i'm out filming or down in an edit putting a piece together. it's a very communal office, so if you're not on the show you can hop into joke meetings or help out some other aspect of the show. normally if i'm not on i'm probably prepping for an upcoming field shoot or perusing the internet for some nugget of news to jump into. either way, there is still a part of me thinking about what i will be watching on netflix later in the night- but ultimately i'll spend an hour scrolling through netflix, unable to make a decision and thus leaving me frustrated by my indecisiveness. then it's the morning and i do it again.
i grew up in michigan where guns were much more normalized. it's always been an interesting issue in america as they mean very different things to people depending on how and where you grew up. also, ive done a few pieces on tds about guns and found the conversations on both sides of the topic to be fascinating. surprisingly there seemed to be a good amount of common ground that wasn't being talked about and i wanted to go back to michigan and hear some of the moderate voices than don't tend to get air play.
1. we were filming with pat mcnamara at a north carolina gun range on the back of his flat bed truck. it started rolling down the hill and while the crew stood dumbstruck, pat mac took off, full sprint and grabbed the truck, put it in park and also saved equipment that was near destruction. he is a super hero 2. giant step forward
because then he would be forced to show reasonable gun advocates instead of crazy people like militias.
the thing is, the more powerful the weapons, the easier violence escalates. here in germany (population 63 million), police only killed like 6? people last year because they *don't* have to assume that every criminal has a gun and could turn around and instantly kill them. killing each other with knives happens but it's much harder than with guns. it's also much more up close, brutal and messy which keeps the barrier for violence higher.
what do you think about the fact that the nations with the largest amount of legal weapons have the worlds lowest murder rate, like switzerland, sweden, norway, finland, even usa is not even top 100 when it comes to murder rate, while the nation with the lowest amount of legal weapons and strictest gun laws are the nations with the highest rate of murders, like mexico, brazil, honduras?
i'm 19, i've been depressed since i was 6, have c-ptsd and can hardly function. i also have no friends, no family, no interests, no skills, nothing. is there hope?
do you have any limits? for instance, some people you *wont* be able to treat, any certain illnesses?
what is the worst case you've ever seen? also for something a bit more personal, what are some study tips for someone with adhd?
hi there! 18 y/o starting college in the fall here! do you have any tips on prioritizing mental health in college and/or not getting completely overwhelmed by the demands of school?
im really struggling with self worth. i just sort of don't like myself. on good days i'm ok with myself. just ok. on bad days i absolutely despise every aspect of myself, physical and mental. i want to be confident and love myself and feel good enough but i have no idea how. no one around me is making me feel this way, it's just me. i have friends but sometimes i just feel like an imposter. why would they want to hang out with me, you know? and my entire sense of humor has slowly just become self deprecating jokes and that's how i cope. it's not healthy at all. in my brain, i understand i can't be that bad, but something inside just makes me deny all logic. i just feel stuck. i don't even know how i feel to be honest. any advice? big or small, i just need something.
i have a weird theory/idea that hospitals and huge doctors offices/clinics should have a therapist on site for people to deal with diagnosis like cancer or things with no cure or a probability of a low cure rate, what do you think of this ?
what are some great things about residing and working in washington (state)?
as someone who works with teens, what is your opinion of 13 reasons why? would you say that the controversy surrounding it is merited, or an overreaction? do you think that it could cause a problem with youth who watch it?
not sure if you've read or watched 13 reasons why, but if you have, what are your thoughts on it? have some of your clients brought it up with you during your appts?
what is the most difficult adult case you've ever dealt with?
do comfort/emotional support animals actually have a high success rate of working to help? what percentage of people in the usa actually scam the system and don't need a support animal but have the paper work just to have their animal in public places?
fellow therapist here who specializes in emergency psychiatry work. how often do you work with a psychiatrist/psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner?
in the book 'miskakes were made but not by me' the authors state that a lot of rapes discovered in therapy that happend in childhood actually never happend at all, but were planted in the memory of the patience by therapists when they asked again and again about childhood memories. what are your thoughts about that?
do any kids mistaken you for sexual services and try to make advances?
why does your certificate expire 3 months after you received it?
do you have any regrets with the patients you work with? any advice you wish you gave sooner or didn't give at all?
yes there is hope. there is specific c -ptsd treatments like trauma focused cbt. i don't know your full situation. depression is like being in a dark hole where you are in the hole and people above you are trying to throw you a rope to get out and what you need is someone to get in there with you and show you the way out. i highly suggest going on psychologytoday.com and searching out a therapist in your area. also look into autism services or social groups. depression is deeply hard. trying looking on the inside and see where maybe you are hindering yourself from social interactions in your thinking. there is always hope. always.
are you serious? unless someone is considering hurting themselves or others, or the topic is triggering, what's unethical about offering advice? man, people get their panties all bunched in a wad over the silliest things sometimes.
yes.therapists should work on a principle of "do no harm". if i don't think i am adequately trained in something i will not see that client but will always offer a referral to someone who does. specifically i don't really treat border line personality disorder, schizophrenia (anymore) and autism. i am not specifically trained in a lot of these.
washington state is amazing. i actually reside in portland but am licensed in wa state...it's weird i know. different states have different licensing guidelines.
i know it's a huge cultural phenomenon right now and it is being addressed in mental health agencies right now, but i haven't seen it. i definitely should though. my only thought is that i wish netflix would put the suicide hotline up before every episode.
i was told by my therapist the prevailing theory in the field of psychology is that people who have had lifelong depression are basically fated to stay that way the rest of their lives. he does not agree, but is that in fact the prevailing theory at the moment?
it was just a simple question. seems if anyone is overreacting...
is there a reason you dont help schizophrenic patients anymore?
son of a bitch.. thats nuts. do you know where the kid ended up? if he's a minor i'd imagine the state or whatever would do something for him, especially with his background of abuse.
yeah definitely, the suicide hotline would be a really good resource for them to put out there. they put content warnings up on 3 episodes, two of which depict rape and the other depicts suicide, but i don't think its enough. you'll probably end up watching it eventually though and you can draw your own conclusions :)
thank you so much for such a detailed and long response! i'll definitely be looking into the types of therapists you recommended. i truly appreciate the work you have done already and continue to do. it's inspiring people like you who help me push through the hard times. i love that you're challenging toxic masculinity. it's time we address it! thanks again.
due to the sensitive nature of my work and having been threatened before and due to the fact that i just moved and am redoing my floors so everything is packed in boxes which i haven't gone through yet, this is the best i got, if it's not good enough sorry. i understand things can be faked but part of my responses i think your can see that i know what i am talking about as well but really i'm sorry. y line of work can be dangerous and this is the best i can do.
not op but in similar field and i haven't come across that idea at all. i imagine it's something that depends on the practitioner but where i've worked, depression (even ongoing, multiple episodes) is seen as treatable with therapy/medication or both.
honestly it was hard to tell whether this was depressive psychosis, brought on by severe depression or the start of schizophrenia. he was a heavy pot smoker, which at the age of 17 or 18 can trigger the start of schizophrenia if it runs in the family, which it did.
so this sounds very difficult. you are in the process of grieving the loss of an extremely important relationship to you. grief is not linear, it ping pongs around on a given day and this relationship doesn't seem like it can't be salvaged with time. it might take a while. what i tell a lot of clients is, you can't control what someone else does or reacts like, only you can control your emotions and actions. i don't know what it's like to be in your shoes so i can't give you that. i know what it's like to lose important relationships however. i guess the only reflection i would have would be, in telling her what's on your mind, does it meet what your goal maybe? if you don't know what your goal maybe in this circumstance that is something to think about. reconciliation? pissing her off?
you would think but sexual offenders are shunned like you wouldn't believe. most get mandated sexual offender treatment but at that age they can be put on the sex offender level and have to register if charged and it will vastly screw up any chance they have at a job, college or life in general. they are the one true class that fall through the cracks completely.
well i hope you can still understand my skepticism. it's also dangerous to give advice under the guise of a person of authority. people tend to take the advice of a person who credits themselves as a professional, much more seriously than a person who does not. if you do manage to get your further proof, without putting yourself at risk, that would give me peace of mind. sorry if i've offended you in any way.
i have also been told this by tons of therapists. i had no idea this was not set in stone as a "fact". the way it has been put to me is that because things started to go wrong very early on while my brain was still developing, and because i haven't had the experience of not being the way i am, i will always to some extent have to manage my mental health in a way that someone who does not have a chronic problem would not have to manage it.
damn. i had a gf in highschool that had psychosis. it's was horrible
thanks for responding. it gave me some much needed clarity, i wouldn't want to hurt her or piss her off.. i guess i just wish i could ask her if she realizes how profoundly she hurt me. it's hard to reconcile who i perceived her to be and what i perceived our relationship to be worth to each of us with how it's all turned out. i appreciate your feedback, very cool of you to do this ama :)
can you tell us anything about what working with kate mckinnon is like?
i have seen the movie 3 times already, thanks to screenings. i love it! you should be proud. my second question: you have to have known there would be a minor backlash with the idea of "killing a stripper" (i saw no problem with the comedy esp. in the movie where he wasn't even a stripper*spoiler) every topic is so sensitive these days, why did you go that direction on your first big blockbuster type movie knowing there would be that kind of a social risk factor?
was wondering/hoping if there might be any cameos from the cast of *very bad things* in your film?? i loved *vbt* back in the late 90s and really enjoyed the trailers for *rough night*. super excited to see your work. the concept is teeming with opportunities for dark humor. just wishing/hoping/dreaming there might be a cameo!!
i just watched broad city last night for the first time - legit me and my best friend, to a t. how was it going from directing this fantastically relatable show, to what looks to be a hilarious departure from reality in rough night?
hi lucia - love broad city! what was it like to work with scarlett johansson in a comedic role??
what kind of role does bo burnham have in this new movie?
what was the casting process like for this film? did you have these girls in your mind when you wrote the character or did you write the characters and do minor changes to what was written to fit the girls.
was there anything about directing a feature that really surprised you?
any tips on being breaking in to the director game? did it help to start in the writers room?
any opening day plans? super excited to see the women kill it onscreen.
sorry aussies and kiwis but... kate mckinnon's character seems to be one of them based on the trailers. was the character written that way or did she add that touch?
if you found a lamp, would you rub it and kind of hope it was a magic one? if a genie popped out and granted you three wishes, what would they be? if the magic part was that after vigorously rubbing the lamp instead of a genie popping out, the lamp would reach orgasm, would you be happy that you had found a magic lamp or disappointed that you had gotten a lamp off, and presumably were now covered in lamp cum?
rough night looks hilarious! do you have a favorite scene in the movie??
no because she's always been so funny on snl and in like, don jon and stuff.
no, sorry. the movie doesn't really have a lot in common with vbt except for the accidental death (spoiler: our girls don't kill each other). but i think you'll love it!!
bo plays tobey, one of peter's best friends (peter is scarlett's finacee, played by paul w. downs). he helps inspire peter with one of the most epic monologues i believe has ever been committed to film. he's incredible.
1. yes 2. world peace, for my family and friends to be healthy for a very long time, and for mother nature to take back what is rightfully hers. 3. i do not shame the sexuality of lamps, and would be happy to have been part of it's pleasure.
i keep changing my mind on what my favorite scene is. right now it's when peter does his sobriety test.
do you talk like a goddamn idiot or just type like one to fit in with millennials.
in case you missed it, it was the actor himself asking the director what it was like working with himself, for a laugh, and "who dat" is the director's response to be silly. who pissed in your cheerios this morning?
and what, u fk ur mom. u prick. no difference. who da fk gv u da rite to queston his writing. as its calong as u understand or wtse, kunt. so go fuck ur self . u new xactly wat he was talking ab0ut. its called communication.............and what is a millennader... like nancy.
just kidding love pat he's the best and has one of the best lines in the movie.
that director is a real pinnacle of humor and intellect. i'm sure the movie will be a hoot. that is a very canadian saying. are you from america's attic?
can't wait to upvote this 17 different times later this week.
the mirrored text brought this to a different level.
thank you /u/ih8mypp for wasting your weekend so we may smile on a monday.
i didn't realize how much i missed groot until now.
great job, op. i can't wait to see how may reposts this gets with your watermark.
reposts help people who missed the content the first time get a chance to see it. what we need are reposts that give credit to the original posts. give credit where credit is due.
how'd this go from 22k upvotes down to 15k upvotes??
what's with the 4,000 downvotes in the last few hours
what. didnt this have like 19000 upvotes? how come its at 7000 now?
saw this at 20,000 upvotes and now it's at 9,000 :( does anyone know where it peaked?
stupid question: how are people making the captions float with the movement in the frame? is it a plugin for after effects or something?
i like reposts. it's sometimes fun to see a raccoon lose his cotton candy or a kangaroo get punched by an aussie or a comic of a dog finding out he's a good boy.
this has gone from 21000 upvotes, to 17000, now it's at 11000
so this wins right? this gif just won reddit. all of it.
i'll never be able to see what it is because it never loads for me.
this post was well over 10000 upvotes and now it's 5000, so who are the children that downvote? honestly i'm surprised people defend themselves as being reposters this way
hey pp, so how does it feel to have the number 1 post on reddit ever? you should do an ama.
why does every comment have fucking at least 20 upvotes???
i was here. and i will be the last one the ever comment on this post!
seriously, it's at 19k now?! i'm posting here just to make history.
after reading your comment i watched it like 6 more times and i still don't see it. where is it?
it says, "we gotta make him a real redditor!" for anyone wondering.
i'm still a bit confused, is baby groot the same groot but a new spawn? or did the og groot die and this is sapling is sort of his son?
why are people so hesitant and afraid to give op credit in their reposts anyway? do they think that will reduce their karma somehow?
someone said it is an algorithm to drop old content off of popular sub
as much as i hate him, u/gallowboob is one of the more healthy karma whores for the site. he produces oc.
i fucking hate karma decay, its a nonsense way of keeping the front page fresh, but if people are still that happy with this post it should not be decayed until people are fucking done with it. doesn't exactly motivate people to contribute to this shit system.
this is like the 5th post i've seen in a week over 10k. reddit is either bigger than ever, or hive-mindier than ever. or, more likely, both. oh, and don't get me wrong, this is a great post; i upvoted too.
which confuses me because the gif ends saying "he'll fit in fine here". so is /u/ih8mypp saying that most of reddit aren't real redditors? i just want to be clear on the meaning behind it.
iirc from the comics, its a new groot but he retains all his memories from past groots.
in the comics, it's the former. he can regrow from a single twig, and from context (conversations with rocket, mainly) it seems like he maintains all of his former memories when he does this.
iirc, in the comics, he's basically able to regenerate from a single twig, so it'd be the same one. however in the comics the process is only supposed to take a few hours or so, and it appears to be taking substantially longer in the movie-verse, so it might be more of a sapling sort of situation.
you know, they say if you mention u/gallowboob three times in one thread, a repost of his will make it to the front page.
yeah that's why i'm here lol. wanted to see how high the top post was at now.
yeah but 20k? 10k is definitely impressive but 20k is insane.
welp, looks like i found my new series to watch thanks to you two
doesn't that mean he might have clones everywhere and not know it?
eh, do we know for sure that vol 2 takes place more than a few hours after the first one? i haven't seen anything to suggest a significant amount of time has passed.
one of the highest i've seen in my 9yrs of redditing. also, what am i doing with my life.
power points. he can only use fire blast 5 times (or 8 if he used specific drugs)
well that depends. who are you? are you a physical body, a personality and memories, or a combination of both? if you're mind was transferred into a new body would it still be you? i once saw a documentary that dealt with this by robert schneider called "the hot chick." i recommend you check it out. the chick from the notebook is in it.
yeah we don't know how long it's been. though i hope they change things for the movie. baby groot is an adorable character, and fans would be bummed if he fully "grew up" pretty early in the film
check it again in a few hours. reddits algorithm will probably put it back down to 10-15k
he's now employed by unilad, which is a company (?) that (mostly) steals reddit content and reposts to facebook. makes perfect sense, really.
i need a ... *god-damn* ... jan michael vincent over here!
there's only enough time for a jan michael vincent to make it to.. a quadrant. he can't be in two quadrants at once.
i'd say this is more /r/natureismetal. this is just a common and effective hunting method in that sort of terrain.
how? and why? i know what you mean but i dont get it why some posts that have around 6k~ after a few hours have only 4k upvotes. and the percentage is still at 90% upvotes. how does it work?
is reddit where thechive gets its employees as well? content is definitely taken from here.
the longer a post is up reddit removes up votes. it's to prevent one post from always being at the top of r/all
water/flying (or did you leave out the /s i honestly dont know)
your username is confusing me, why is the duck in the middle all by himself? seems like an obvious point of duck-failure in your duck stacking scheme.
that's a strange way of doing it when they could just weigh the votes but still keep the "approximately this many people upvoted it" metric somewhat useful.
couldnt remember. thought he was dragon/water due to the fact he looks like the way japanese and other asian cultures detail their dragons as flying snakes
leaking? we humans do not leak with our fleshy, organic coating containing any necessary fluids.
the president we needed. now time for the one we deserve.
here i am, at 26 years of age. i can safely say this will be the president i go-to when asked, "who would you have run our country again?" for the rest of my life.
canadian here, i'm not even a us citizen nor do i live in the states but, even i feel like i'm losing a great president after tonight. thanks, obama. good luck to everyone after tonight.
this man right here, agree or disagree, knew how to speak to the american people. he could talk about a carton of milk and it would be the most interesting speech about a carton of milk thats ever been said.
i actually am gonna miss obama regardless of what he may have done right or wrong. he was one of the most fun presidents i can think of. maybe being an internet era president helped.
i never really had much of a horse in either race, though i didn't like romney at all and any chance mccain had of getting my vote evaporated when they put a lunatic like palin on his ticket. i like obama as a person, though. i've really enjoyed having a president that genuinely seems to enjoy science and technology and nerdy pursuits, and we've had some really amazing photographs come out of the white house when he's around kids. has he said anything about what he plans on doing after he leaves office?
as someone who didn't vote for obama, and never thought i'd be saying this, i'd totally re-elect him right now if i could. i don't agree with a lot of his politics but there's no denying that he's been an incredibly "presidential" president. he's on his game every time he comes into the public eye. the past 8 years we've seen him angry, we've seen him sad, and we've seen him goofing off with kids, but no matter what he always looks like a president. that's far more than i can say for the two morons we're being stuck with now.
republican here. i never voted for obama but applaud him for two things: sensible foreign policy and (as politicians go) being honest. thank god he kept us out of syria and other unnecessary wars. i disagree with virtually all of his domestic policies but he promoted them in good faith and what he thought was in the country's best interests. he spent eight years in the white house and despite the best effort of his political enemies, he was never impugned with any serious political controversy. the most significant taint of dishonesty during his administration was from hillary clinton-- which shows you how terrible a candidate she is and how much of a decent man he was. i didn't agree with him, but respect him.
in under two hours, this has been one of the most upvoted posts i have seen in my few years on reddit. "hindsight is 20/20" as they say.
no worries, he'll be back in the white house in 12 years. michelle 2028!!!
mr. president, you'll never read this but as a soldier in the u.s. army, i'd like to thank you very much for the past 8 years. you are the epitome of a strong and diplomatic leader that this country deserves. i firmly believe that you did your best despite the hatred and oppression you faced from a shockingly large number of americans. among other things, you pushed to remove troops out of a war we had erroneously entered and you believed everyone deserves health care which is very considerate and commendable. thank you, sir.
if you remember in 2008 republicans said obama will institute sharia law in the us and take away all the guns from people. still waiting.
if you look for yourself (and stop listening to politicians and the media), this country is a better place to live than it was 8 years ago. virtually every standard of living that assesses a first world country is higher in the us now than it was at the end of bush's second term. he wasn't perfect but god knows he's better than these two twats.
thanks for creating the aca. when i was unemployed it took me 5 minutes to enroll. my first meeting with my very awesome doctor i was diagnosed with depression and prescribed sertraline. my prescription cost me $0 a bottle and has been the best thing i have ever done for myself...there's even an argument to be made that it helped keep me from taking my own life. thank you. thank you. thank you.
everyone who completely shitted on obama these last 8 years is gonna talk about him with such nostalgia in a decade i guarantee you
my brother's cancer didn't kill him, thanks to obamacare and the clause that prevents insurance companies from giving him insurance. he is alive thanks to obamacare, and every time i hear a republican say he wants to overturn obamacare, i hear "i want to kill your brother."
you know, as a conservative libertarian i swore i'd hate obama. (no guys i'm not a racist so chill out) 8 years later that's changed a ton. i don't love him, i disagree with some of his choices, but i would call his election a win. i would in a heartbeat take 1 more year of him while we figure out some new election choices. but unfortunately that's a no go. i will however hate hillary until my dying breath ;) also trump is still a pos
i admit he did not do much for me. my life did not change at all. but the one thing that will change, is that on dec 1st, my company has to start paying me overtime. i have to work overtime, it is part of the job and a lot of it. i am going to go from 37k to 45k and i should be getting a good raise this year. it was not horrible under obama.
obama did nothing to stop america being more and more controlled by the wealthy minority, i don't know why you americans are so happy about that? your worse off than ever before, wake up.
yeah we needed to show people how retarded liberal policies are. sincerely your daily injection of thought from the other side of the aisle. remember kids. not everyone is a liberal who thinks obama was wonderful. 99% of the people on here who think obama was so great act like he was perfect. which is funny and irritating considering all the scandals he had. welcome to our world. enjoy it. you'll be here quite a few years.
honest question: has joe biden done anything while he's been in office? do any vice presidents do anything in office? why do we even elect vice presidents!? they're useless!
these are such beautiful memes. no good memes will come from the white house in these next four years. :(
he's planning on opening a beach front shop in hawaii where he will sell nothing but plain white t-shirts
i never voted for obama, but i certainly did appreciate his thoughtful approach to questions and such. instead of just spewing some ideological party empty rhetoric. it was nice to have a president that would actually acknowledge the opposite position, and talk about why that position would be held, and then explain his position in respect to that opposite position. demonstrates a much greater understanding of how to come to a better conclusion on an issue. you don't get that out of people that just spew "opposite position is always bad". unfortunately, i don't think we would get that out of the top 2 candidates in this election.
everyone always says the same thing, "obama is great even though i don't care for his politics" then they never mention a single thing he supported that went wrong. dude is a legend and possibly the best president *ever*.
i truly appreciate people who can disagree with someone and yet still respect them as a person.
i think michelle wants to be oprah, not president.
us marine checking in, couldn't agree more. thank you for your service, brother.
lol, and my husband just said to me today "i have to go buy ammo it will all be gone tomorrow!!" (if hillary wins, he says).
he did an amazing job with what was handed to him. no one is perfect but he's wwwaaayyyy better than these two twats
i'm so happy for you. i lost my boyfriend last week due to depression. i'm so glad you're better now, and were able to get help.
"don't it always seem to go, that you don't know whatcha got till its gone"
:( it's true. thanks, obama. for not destroying america and dealing with all the hatred.
we've been talking about him with nostalgia ever since we found out who the candidates were going to be this year.
remember when people shit on him for talking to russia? now those same shit heads call trump's bromance with putin "genius".
ya once we forget about the ndaa, drone strikes, and prosecuting whistle blowers.
maybe it's due to the general disdain towards both candidates, but everyone seems to absolutely love obama now. the way things are going, i feel like he's going to be heralded as one of the greatest modern us presidents
he became the retrospective best option and people are starting to regret all the bitching i think...
alright, you have to no rules mud wrestle one of the two nominees. pick one go.
what good have you done? at least the man had class and a harvard law degree instead of a spray tan and trump u degree...
the difference is obama is personable and likeable and obama has a personality. hillary also lacks any sense of self awareness and is afraid of saying anything that isn't part of the script
it felt really painful to vote for her. assuming she wins i'm preparing for the next four years to be filled with her shooting herself in the foot while insisting she's just like middle class americans. obama could be so funny sometimes, but when's the last time hillary made *anyone* laugh?
someone's gotta slam some tall boys of milluwalkies best ice and wash an iroc z in cut off jean shorts on the white houses front lawn and diamond joe is just the man for the job.
have you seen the trump campaign? it's literally nothing but dank memes as far back as late 2015. i think they can keep it going.
he will always be barefoot and will forget what stress is. michelle and the kids will be playing in the warm ocean, bathed in sunlight. obama is home.
i'm not even american but i agree. whenever i watched his speeches or even pictures, i'd get some sort of special charm or charisma that he would reflect. atleast to me, he looked like one of the best presidents usa has ever got.
fdr did a good job too. fdr also served three terms, which we all wish obama could do now.
i know i learned that in the west wing but i found it to be a funnier image if it was barry behind the wheel:)
he's not wrong. tomorrow is going to be a great day to own a gun store if hillary wins.
my insurance went up so much that i had to choose between having coverage or being able to make my mortgage payment. thanks, obama.
"a gay pair of guys put up a parking lot" ...that's the words, right?
thanks for not getting assassinated too. i mean i was like 70% sure there'd be a really massive assassination attempt taken on him. not that president biden would have been a bad thing of course, just it would have been a shame to lose obama.
meanwhile obama's like "i'm not fucking dead yet!"
honestly, i wanted this to be another 3rd term president like roosevelt. i think it was the perfect time for us to just stick with obama.
honestly with the way the senate us threatening to block her. she should put her balls on the table and nominate him, just to give them all an aneurysm. but i think michelle would hhaaaattte that idea
i don't see why he got so much hate in the first place. from my perspective he did a very good job
alright.. but apart from the passing, the passing, the passing, the ending, the beginning, the eliminating, the turning, the recapitalising, the repealing, the toppling, the telling, the reversing, the improving, the kicking, the creating, the boosting, the coordinating, the passing, the beginning, the increasing, the tightening, the creating and a bit more of the passing, what has obama ever done for us!
even glenn beck has already admitted he was wrong about obama
don't forget... he expanded the middle eastern conflict to libya, syria and yemen! he gave billions of dollars worth of weapons to terrorist supporters! he launched a drone program which has killed hundreds and hundreds of innocent people, often based on flimsy meta data! he not only continued with the patriot act, he expanded it! he created new powers that allow authorities to detain americans without trial. he didn't accomplish any of his promises regarding the middle eastern conflicts, or shutting down extra-judicial prisons or treatment of prisoners - including torture. he made it impossible to sue monsanto he promised not to employ lobbyists in his administration and subsequently filled his administration with lobbyists. he provided weapons to drug cartels in south america. he supported a tax funded bailout for the very same financial institutions that were responsible for it in the first place. thanks obama!
first thing that popped up was "reduce prescription cost" lol. yet increased the cost of premiums overall? and now i'm paying much more than i would've before then. the next one was regarding planned parenthood- the one who literally kills babies who are alive and breathing after they remove them. then- they sell the baby parts to the highest bidder.
what the fuck reddit... i only needed one thing tonight to be baffled about tonight, now i have this too huh?
obama is already the greatest gun salesman in history.
how much was that plan? i never saw anything with that low of out of pocket.
please, no! this was the hold music for it support. shoot me now.
the far right conservatives have been incoherently screaming about how obama was going to destroy america since the day he took office. obama's obviously a failure because he didn't even pull off fema death camps or take away our guns.
are you referencing ray narvaez jr.? edut: you are! ;(
except after roosevelt they added term limits, so a third term was not an option.
having to choose between 2 shitty candidates (excluding the 3rd party candidates since we know they won't win anyway) really puts things into perspective.
obama was definately not great, but trudeau is an asshat indeed.
no man only biden gets one. who the hell gonna tell him he can't have his sweet set of wheels when he needs it to go pick up a case of brewskies or impress all those fine young ladies with a sick burn out?
and yet they will face no consequences for crying wolf. ugh.
w wasn't terrible, i don't think. i mean... yes. he was. but i think a lot of that was him having shit go down all at once and he was just really bad at handling it. i think without 9/11, without katrina without any of the stuff that he had to react to he'd be seen as that funny dude we let sit behind the desk and twiddle his thumbs for 8 years while dick cheney made decisions. basically what i'm saying is: i don't think he was bad because he's bad, i think he was bad because he reacted in stupid ways.
they won't win because you didn't vote for any of them. til sadness
wtf when did this happen? is he taking a face turn now?
those three are are well known to do a lot of fact checking. i won't continue to argue because i know how your kind is. aside from this, have a nice day.
they refused the money, but what were the requirements? federal money usually comes with a lot of red tape
sigh, you are right. i'm dutch and we do pay a lot of taxes but because everybody give a little bit we have an amazing healthcare etc. it's a shame there are people who really can't understand these kind of things.
my healthcare is great, thank you. i work for it, and i picked a job that could provide it. i wish people could understand these things
it's fantastic that many airlines teach flight attendants to look for the signs of human trafficking. i hope she got rewarded for her quick thinking.
good for her. i can only hope that if i'm ever in a situation like this i'll be aware enough to see the signs and act.
you know what i wouldn't want if i'd saved someone from traffickers? my name and photo all over the internet.
it's odd to me that i can't find any article online regarding the underlying arrest and/or trial of the man allegedly arrested for trafficking the girl from this story.
i wonder how she got the note written and in the bathroom before the girl walked in?
this is amazing. this is what i wish we, as human beings, should focus on. stop spending money trying to defeat drugs, and use that money to go after human traffickers. in my opinion, this should be our #1 focus, and where most of our money is spent. god bless this woman.
innocent question, sorry for my ignorace: why doesn't the victim go for help in the first place? she's in a public area and can yell or ask for help at any time. why do most victims of human trafficking stay silent?
she was 14-15, and is in college now, meaning this happened 3-4 years ago.
i wonder if he was just stupid or does this happen often given he took a fucking plane. and by this i mean human trafficking in the broad open.
wheres the rest of the story? did the man go to jail? was he a us citizen, where were they going? how was the girl abducted? where was she abducted from? so little details.. the article headline had as much info as the actual article did. reddit is becoming the next facebook. this shit was all over my facebook this morning and someone has to post it here to get karma. typical internet shit.
they teach us what to look for, but it's quite difficult in practice to spot such things. to be honest, if this had been on my flight to houston two days ago, i'd have just thought the dude was a jerk, and she was shy.
it's mind blowing how human trafficking happens in plain sight.
when i worked as a park ranger i came across a couple (around 30) with two children (boy 7, girl 5) and what struck me as odd was the "parents" were disheveled, their clothes was older and worn, and they were obviously quite poor. nothing wrong with all that; however, the kids were well dressed, clean, much more articulate than the parents, and just didn't really fit. i spent hours looking through databases, making phone calls, and trying to find out something about an abduction that would match them. went and spent time with them, not uncommon as a ranger and came to realize... they were just good parents who did everything for their kids even when they couldn't do it for themselves.
something my ex-stepmother did to keep people from suspecting her of abusing me was she would convey the appearance that i was the misbehaving child and, as a result, the general public would pity her and look down on me. so i think it happens more than people realize but adults are so quick to believe it's the kid who is at fault that they don't think twice about the situation.
just don't let your hostage go to the restroom, and you'll be fine
i live in thailand. i've met human trafficking victims. westerners here laugh at it because they want to keep fucking young girls and boys. locals deny it because of pride and the ability to make easy money. you quickly become a pariah by observing the fucking obvious. it's enough to make a person go mad. the saddest thing is most human trafficking victims go unnoticed because they don't work in the sex industry or anything closely related to sex. if you've eaten shrimp in the last month there's a good chance you've been complicit in the modern slavery of children. and there's precious little any of us can do about any of it. theres a good reason why i like drinking.
serious question. i've been reading a lot about this kind of thing in the past few days and i'm just kind of confused about the scenario. if you're on a plane being held hostage, especially in the states, couldn't you just stand up and announce once in air that you're being held hostage? what's the guy going to do? murder you on the plane in front of potentially hundreds of other people? i never understand how these types of people can get away with actually taking teenage or adult women on flights or into public places without being found out.
good to see the training in spotting trafficking is helping.
yeah. aren't human traffickers not nice ppl? i'd stay anonymous, thanks.
most human traffickers aren't (forceful) kidnappers. they're not going to try to kill this lady or anything. why would any dude this guys done business with want to put themselves in more danger by trying to get to this lady.
he kidnapped and trafficked himself out of the country to avoid justice
i read the original article because i wanted to know too - she apparently whispered to the girl to go to the bathroom and i guess just monitored who went?
sees girl going to bathroom, "excuse me darling, i need to check something in there real quick before you go in."
you know who are the clients of human traffickers? the richest people in the world (underage boys and girls are the most trafficked humans). you know who decides where the money will be focused on? the richest people in the world.
they're afraid of the person they're with, they have usually had a life where they couldn't trust anyone, they are broken down psychologically.
op couldn't even spell her name right, he's really racing for the karma.
in the last airport i was in there were posters everywhere about signs of human trafficking, so this is probably more common than most people think.
this was my thought. if you're dumb/evil enough to be human trafficking, why would you take a plane? that girl must have gone through hell for her to have been quiet as long as she was in public.
i imagine he must've scared the girl so badly she didn't dare to do anything drastic in public.
honestly, kudos to those parents. because many parents don't have that drive or character to sacrifice everything for their kids to boost them up into a better place.
my parents made a lot of sacrifices so us kids could have the best stuff.
the term 'child prostitute' is a problem in itself, there is no such thing, by definition and substance they are rape victims not prostitutes. terminology matters.
while it's debatable if prostitution should be legal or not, imo it should *never* be debatable if the prostitute could be punished by law. i mean, if you think about it, how very low must the number of people selling their body that don't voluntarily "choose" to do it but rather feel they have hardly/no other options be? afaik the vast majority however are people with mental (health) problems, drug addictions (oops, i forgot. unfortunately way too many countries criminalize drug addicts as well instead of trying to offer help) or a outright forced in some way.
i've been boycotting all shrimp for a while. is there a way to get shrimp that is actually slavery free?
i hope that you don't turn to drinking. time, money, effort spent on trying to help those affected (if you're able to) will give you much more happiness and give others around you much more happiness too. much more productive use of your time. you'll be a hero in all of our hearts if you take the time to help even one get out of that system.
what signs are there that a girl has been trafficked? like what would her body language or expression be?
so the flight attendant just left a note in the bathroom and hoped the victim went to the bathroom and saw it?
she is an amazing person but this is very lucky that the victim was literate in english. it could otherwise have ended very tragically, with the girl not realising that someone was reaching out to help.
i'm curious as to how the victim received the note
people most likely to be trafficked are those that won't be able to speak out. i worked with the national center for youth law on trafficking in oakland. the girls that i met were quiet, meek, abused. some had histories of abuse from when they were babies and have spent their lives under someone's thumb. those girls had seen people in their situations murdered. some have stories about friends who escaped only to be found later and brought back. it's always worst if you try to run so they don't try. it's really heartbreaking because my first thought when i met some of them was to ask why they don't run or scream when in public. because that's what i'd do. but after hearing their stories you understand why they are victims. they are broken down to submission.
people just don't. it seems to be something about the way we're programmed. even in that sort of a situation, especially if someone has been conditioned to fear retribution. there are all sorts of simple ways out of it. tell security that you have a bomb would get you arrested, and you can explain later, for example. but people don't.
i think about that too. you would think on a plane, where your captor couldn't have a weapon, it would be the perfect place to break free.
dude you're so closed minded you're not even thinking about the potential karma
i'll have you know, i saw taken 1,2 and 3 and traffickers don't mess around.
pretty sure i see human trafficking every time i walk home from work. rotating beggar ladies keep giving money to this one guy and sometimes they get into loud arguments. slavery is very much alive and easy to spot but most people dont because the victims dont look as crushed as you might think they should, for a lot of them its their normal life and thats really fucking sad.
help! i'm being trafficked by my alternate personality!
it says in the article she was able to signal to the girl to go to the bathroom after she had left the message on the mirror.
i'm sure they weren't just picked off the street and put on a plane also. girls are probably groomed after months/years of being held somewhere else. now they're ready to make big money in america, after being trained with fear.
and that's the scary part. we're taught to "if you see something say something" but in our head we have so many rationalizations for why something might be some way that it might be too late by the time someone does actually say something.
can you explain the correlation between the super bowl and looking out for victims of human trafficking?
you're constantly around people in abusive, semi-hostage type situations. learning to hide that in public is a survival skill. if you try something and don't get help you face horrific retribution from your abuser. the vast majority of abuse victims will be able to hide it from you completely. if anything the fact that this girl didn't is a sign that she wasn't yet completely under the control of he captor. the story of elizabeth smart is a good example of how victims generally comport themselves in public.
most times the families are threatened , and for the victim there is no way to tell if it is true or not (thankfully most of the time it is not). imagine , this person took you away from everything you know, and from your family and friends, there is no way for them to tell how big the ring is or who else is into it. pretty damn fucking horrible there is people willing to do this kind of shit.
my parents used to tell me they wouldn't buy me clothes because my sister was a girl and needed them more (plus they thought a little boy having more than 4 sets of clothes made them gay). i wonder if those kids knew how lucky they were.
it's hard because sometimes the kid is really just throwing a fit. my sister used to scream "you're breaking my arm!" at the top of her lungs, even if nobody was touching her. there's just no easy way to filter the dramatic from the dire.
which is why i tell my children if they are in a dire situation, you scream "help, he is not my daddy".
bless you. and yes--just make sure the shrimp originates from canada or a similar country
it says she tried to speak to them, so i guess she knew that the girl spoke english
couldn't the flight attendant ask for the police to look into the situation after they land anyway?
seattle to san fran is like a one hour flight. i rarely see anybody get up at all on a flight like that. my guess is the flight attendant somehow suggested she go to the bathroom. not sure how
wow. the telling security you have a bomb is a good one. i'll keep that in my back pocket in case i ever catch myself in a kidnapping scenario.
that's got me thinking...do human traffickers like the taken franchise? nuts to think these fucking assholes are among normal people, and masquerade as normal folks daily
what's the universal signal for going to the bathroom?
fear and drugs. get them hooked on heroin while controlling all of their money. the trafficker will give them the drugs for free and suddenly they have no option but to follow them around work for their next fix. combine that with physical violence, emotional abuse, and tell them nobody will believe them even if they did go to the authorities. people are fucked.
huge sporting events and large conventions always become hot-zones for human trafficking. my guess is that it is because you have huge numbers of (lets be honest) men who are traveling away from home with friends or alone on business and make for good customers to sex workers.
the super bowl attracts a world wide audience, so disgustingly terrible people from all over the world could be "traveling" there for the game and instead know about an underground trafficking ring.
i remember when elizabeth smart went missing, it happened in my area. my parents put an end to the riding of bikes all around our small town, my older brother and i were so bummed. we were constantly supervised, it changed the whole vibe of our neighborhood.
this is kind of what i was wondering. maybe he had some collateral set in place, with a sibling or something? because what else would stop her from just saying that? i guess i'm also probably not thinking as a child would, but still.
why do people keep misspelling clothes in this thread?
yup. disheveled parents with clean cut kids and expensive strollers? definitely in (western) brooklyn now.
it's not hard because sometimes the kid is really just throwing a fit. it's hard because most of the time its a kid just throwing a fit.
what's that subreddit i'm supposed to link in cases like this? r/retiredgifs?
this is shelia fredrick, a flight attendant. she noticed a terrified girl accompanied by an older man. she left a note in the bathroom on which the victim wrote that she needed help. the police was alerted & the girl was saved from a human trafficker. we should honor our heroes.
i've tried that move on the ladies too, not much success.
without the police/security waiting at the gate, it'd be easy for suspect to disappear into crowd of the airport when you consider the majority of airport security is outward facing. yes they could lock down the airport but that'd be a nuclear option i'm sure you could only pull with proof or obvious threat.
"here's your sprite, miss. and if you need to use the restroom, i know soda makes me need to go, there's a restroom right back there. i'd suggest the one on the left because the one on the right is always dirty. the one on the left has a note on the mirror for you asking if this guy you're with is a dangerous kidnapping rapist too, so use that one."
no, the flight is at least twice that long, if not more.
yeah that's a pretty good one, going to be my new go-to plan my old go-to plan was running as fast as i can in random directions screaming "fucking help me" if i knew the guy had a gun or a long ranged weapon of some kind i'd run into the biggest crowd of people (i'm sorry i just want to live)
yeah especially with the guy sitting right between them. i wish she provided more details of how it all went down.
actually, the way she approached it should always work. she left paper and pencil in the bathroom (it says a note which may mean she *did* do more than just that). if you just leave the materials, that could be for anything.
wow. absolutely sickening. i must be really naive because i've honestly never even considered that this type of thing is that common. that makes me really sad/angry, especially because i have no idea how everyday people like myself can help stop this type of thing.
can confirm, i work in a hotel near cleveland, over the rnc we were told specifically to look for these signs. it's a big thing.
i'm still confused. wouldn't you be on high alert for someone *with* a victim, like in the story? who would bring their victims to the same city the superbowl is happening?
it wasn't just your neighborhood. that shit fucked with the whole country. fuckin media.
hipsters aren't really disheveled. their dishevelment is curated.
i definitely do. i once wrote him a hand written letter (if you saw my hand writing you'd see why i added that in there...it's a chore for me) expressing my appreciation. he never said a word about it but i was borrowing socks from him while home last thanksiving and the letter was tucked in his sock drawer and was the only thing in there that doesn't go on your feet, which makes me think it's special to him.
i would add, as a young and single person, i was honestly surprised how hard it was to tell between "fake" crying and legit "im in pain" crying. took a long while to recognize that half pitch down less sharp scream that is a kid just being an asshole.
ah, i've been offered baskets and bags and stuff in the store because i tend to end up carrying too much and i take forever to browse. i've never stolen anything in my life. (okay, some stickers when i was in 3rd grade and i still feel bad about that even though i went in and bought a bunch of stickers the next week to make up for being a shitty sticker stealer. in my defense, they probably had unicorns and smelled like strawberry.)
plaintext goes in the square brackets, url goes in the parentheses.
i'm still confused. so, the flight attendant leaves a note in the bathroom? how is she aware that the girl is going to be the next one to use it? why does the bad guy let the girl use the restroom? (i guess so he doesn't get peed on). is the girl on the way to the bathroom (and the flight attendant knows which one) and then the flight attendant jumps in the bathroom, leaves the note, comes out of the restroom, the girl uses it, writes a note, then the flight attendant goes back in, gets the note? there's actually part of this story that still has holes in my head.
it's usually scheduled for 2 hours 15 minutes but almost every time i've taken that flight we've landed 15-30 minutes early. source: live in sf area, family is in seattle.. i make that trip a lot.
i hope they dont share this information... what if it's something they're taught in training to subtly do this and we're giving information to human traffickers and they watch out for it?
i mean, this is kinda smart. would it be smart to put a small notepad & dropbox in high-traffic transportation-related washrooms, or a panic button? seems like it would cover a lot of situations. then again, people are dicks.
the girl could have just ordered an angel shot and it also would have gone smoothly.
the amount of prostitutes in northern michigan when deer hunting starts also escalates tremendously.
at least you're told to look to help. all the hotels and motels around here either continue to rent to pimps and prostitutes or if they realize there is prostitution going on they just blacklist whoever got the room.
on a related note, hotels always see massive spike in their ppv adult tv programs whenever a big evangelical convention is in town.
curated dishevelment is the name of my death jazz band.
yeah, it's something you pick up really quickly once you have a kid. there's an almost primal element to a pain scream. i almost don't even hear crying anymore; it's completely white noise. but a cry of pain makes my gut drop and the hairs on my neck stand up. i think pretty much everyone reacts this way because it's just something you know, but you don't realize it until you're used to hearing "fake" crying so often.
haha baskets are also a marketing tactic. you tend to buy more if you're given a basket. so a lot of sales people are told to give everyone a basket since it deters shoplifting and gets you to buy more stuff. these are usually places that have lots of little items like boutiques for jewelry or makeup like claire's or sephora.
ah yes i remember this day, you said username checks out under the kangaroo and i_can_recall then in precisely 30 seconds someone comments under you about how your not the username checks out guy. and that if their username checks out then how come they recalled or something similar
if only there were u.s. political parties that were financially conservative and socially liberal.
apparently she managed to tell the girl, under her breath, to go to the bathroom, at which point she left a note and the girl went and found it.
yes, this was my question as well! it's awesome that she recognized the situation and helped the girl, but i just don't understand how the note thing worked.
this story seemed odd to me as well so i dug a little more. it occurred in 2011. i'm not sure why it's in the news now.
no, pig latin always starts with the first vowel of the word. however he/ she wrote "eh-thay," and it should be "e-thay."
she could say they will be turning on the seat belt sign and if she needed the rest room to go now. i don't know i wasn't there, but that seems like a harmless approach.
this whole article is a red flag. i feel like by publicizing things of this nature, we're helping them to get a leg up and improve their technique.
if a parent absolutely refuse to let their kid pee thats also pretty weird.
if you did these things they would quickly be figured out and the traffickers would avoid them.
maybe i'm an asshole, but i think i would have told my mom i wasn't gonna wear the jumper. :/
if this app actually can help, surely hotel owners can be persuaded to document all of their rooms? or is their more to this app i am missing?
i used to work in a hotel in a big city. the general manager of the place turned a blind eye to most illegal things that happened there because he was far more interested in the profit from having more guests/customers. we were told not to rock the boat, even for obvious and very illegal shit. this fucker perpetuated the whole problem with rich people getting away with whatever they want. we were, however, instructed to bring the hammer down (when the occasion called for it, not just randomly) on guests who were not wealthy/famous/did not spend as much. an even more fun story is that the gm hates snoop dogg, because it took our housekeepers over a month to get the weed smell out of the entire fourth floor. apparently snoop rented a whole floor to himself, and in true d-o-double g fashion, smoked it right the fuck out. my hero.
yup she still does any time my mail is sent to her place. if i get a letter from my grandmother she makes sure to open it to see if theres money inside because she doesn't think i "deserve it" and it's "her mother not mines" so.
nothing belongs to you when you're /r/raisedbynarcissists
tell me more of this "white noise" that you've managed to turn regular crying into. i have a baby who is now 6 months old and even her non-pain cries shred my soul like a rusty cheese grater. how do i make it white noise? please help me.
but i want more information without reading or hearing about it.
says she put it in the toilet?! so this girl just randomly went looking for a note inside the toilet? i'm confused.
let the record show that we are now a fraternity of six, and we will not rest until the great question is answered.
this. it's really simpler than people are making it out to be. she gave the victim a plausible "out" , which any victim would be looking for (at any age), and she took it - if only to get a few seconds away from the piece of shit that should rot and suffer the rest of his days.
right, and that would send pretty much everyone to the bathroom but she had put up a note for one particular person.
yeah, i was thinking the same thing. from now on they would probably either stay away from planes or ensure the kid never leaves their side for any reason whatsoever. it's such a dark world out there, bums me out
of course it is, but you're missing the point. if he had prevented her from going then they wouldn't have received the confirmation they needed to intervene. regardless of how 'weird' it was, they needed a firm confirmation that she was in trouble. so i'm curious how she was able to be smooth enough to get the guy to allow her to go to the bathroom, not because i doubt anything, only because i'm fascinated.
you underestimate the level of conditioning in some kids. not from anything nefarious, violent, or pressuring, just the fact that they've been soaking in a natural order of things with parents and authority figures being the guides and authorities all their life, and they're not worldly or clever enough to realize they can step outside of the lines. it's just not on the conceptual map.
some (many) what motel owners know and accept that there will be prostitutes working there.
what the hell. she needs to see someone. that is sad.
that is illegal. like, 5-year-jail-sentence illegal.
you can come to my show tomorrow night where i will be retelling this tale of everyday heroism through interpretive dance
as the prophecy foretold, there will be seven. not one more. not one less. will there be a hero amongst us who will come forward and, with courage and braverie, be ready and willing to be burdened with the responsibility of an answer? "so the flight attendant just left a note in the bathroom and hoped the victim went to the bathroom and saw it?"
that may be the single most superhero-style-in-real-life thing i've ever seen.
that wasn't just a dad reflex. that was a ninja grandmaster dad reflex. 1.assessment of the threat 2.choice of action and precise chain of acts 3.grabbing children 4.backflip out of dangerous area
i want to know how this ended. was everyone okay? it does look close enough for some injuries.
that fraction-of-a-second though that told him "go for it" rather than "run"
pretty sweet double suplex he pulled off on those kids, just in the nick of time too
i wonder what caused him to get up and look back. probably prior commotion from the car hitting other stuff. regardless, that was some amazing quick thinking and reflex.
give that man something nice. total life saver and probably not the kids' father.
i swear it's like all dads are average joes then there kids are in danger and fucking clark kent is exposed
i think the little one got knocked out, but that's a fair trade for what was about to happen.
everyone is talking how they can't stop watching but this makes me so fucking angry at that driver
did you see the 2 seconds of oh crap? it's that little 2 step thing. i think he had to fight real hard against that flight reflex. good thing he fully committed to his actions after that. any slower and he and kids would have been smashed.
seriously though the way he does a reverse summersault and flips his legs back like that. that's some serious shit right there.
hard enough to do on a matted floor alone. this guy fucking nails a perfect over the shoulder backroll with both hands filled with precious cargo and a car inches away from his head. people are amazing, sometimes.
5. re-assess and identify secondary threat 6. adjust momentum and reprioritize body position 7. lunge toward in-coming debris 8. use body to shield children from secondary threat time elapsed: 2.8 seconds.
he gave the situation an ocular pat down and ruled it unsafe for the kids thus resulting in some great project badass material.
guys a hero!! it makes it all the more impressive because you see his weakness and humanity for a split second before he's like "fuck you death, not getting them."
i'm surprised i had to scroll this far down to see this asked. first thing i noticed after the dodge, was that the kid in the white looked knocked out.
same. i'm a father of a 6 year old girl and 2 year old boy so this was fucking crazy to watch. it scares me that the little boy looks unconscious at the end. i need to know if they are ok plz
you can see him pause for thought. he made the right choice and saved their lives.
it looks to me like the foot shuffle where he stays in place is him fighting his first instinct, which is to run. once he overcomes that, it's pure balls and maneuverability.
bah gawd those kids have a family bah gawd that man *is* their family
do you think this is a move he's practiced before? all three of them get absolutely obliterated with any other move but this one. i'd be dead if i tried to save them.
holy shit that first links dad turned into usain bolt
well, you stay in a state of hyper-awareness that young kids (or someone near them) might do something stupid and dangerous at any second, so then when it happens you're semi-prepared.
someone else in the thread posted a slightly longer video of this. the guy hands off the kid in white to another person and the kid is conscious and looking around. if he did get knocked out, it was only for a fraction of a second.
you can't judge what kind of a person one is from one act, or even a few. life isn't that black and white.
1. assess surroundings and change in noise level. 2. make an approach. 3. use commotion to kidnap two children undetected. 4. hide said children in small area of your chest and stomach as you roll away.
looks like one is his kid, one not, as someone else comes and takes a kid right away.
upvoting because desperately need some context on this
definitely looks like a different dad walks off with the smaller child, making this guy's efforts even more amazing.
i think the split second of weakness is a split second of him formulating exactly what he is going to do. i have 2 young kids, and i've had many dad reflexes, and there is no hesitation when it comes to your kids. it's purely instinct and, unless something in you is broken, irresistible.
looks like they weren't his kids since other people came and grabbed them right away.
also looked like the man's leg might have gotten hit. hope they were all ok!
probably from that suplex. better a bump on the head than getting hit by a car.
i wonder if they're his own kids or he risked his life for someone else's kids. either way he's a hero.
maybe he was just calculating to see whether the ninja roll would be necessary.
he probably wasn't even thinking about whether he was going to try and save them, he was just still realizing the situation.
it wasn't a pause of "do i try to save them" it was a pause of calculating where the car was going, and where to dodge to. you don't want to grab the kids and pull them into the car's path by misjudging where the car is going.
two people who owe their lives to this guy. crazy.
can you imagine his regret if he witnessed it and didn't try to do anything?
and the second guy was so smooth, like "ain't no thang."
yeah i think that was one of the first big dad reflex gifs
solid decision making too. i think i might have gone for the car and plausibly ended up hurting whoever was in it.
this is true. i raised 4 boys, they're in their 20s now, and i can definitely say that hyper-awareness is a real thing. also, i would take a nap, but i could hear all the stuff going on in the background and could be up and in action in less than a second if need be.
twist: man tries to kidnap children while driver tries to serve up hot justice.
this was seriously a "do i shove them out of the way to the left, or do i grab them and roll right" moment
am dad, can confirm. i've never had anything even remotely similar to this, but when my daughter was just a couple months old, she fell asleep on my chest in our bed. i woke up, some 2-3 hours later, holding her ankle in my hand. she was hanging off the edge of the bed, head-first. i grabbed her ankle and stopped her from falling off the bed onto her head without even waking up. she slept through the whole thing. dad reflexes are *no joke*.
yeah i figured it was this. they didn't look like they were with him before the car came. they were walking by and he doesn't look like he was watching them intently.
a friend backed into my knee by mistake one morning. he might have been doing 2mph. i was in pain for more than a week. if anyone's leg got hit at the speed of the car in the gif, you can bet that it is totally fucked.
i feel like this is one of the most badass things i've ever seen someone do.
it was obviously a "is that car gonna turn?....its not gonna turn." moment.
and the lives of those children's parents, if you think about it.
i was having a good day, but this comment ruined it, then thinking how the dad was so great brought it back
the moment of hesitation will now be him thinking "is anyone looking? screw it, i'm going for it."
$10 and my childhood says this happened accidentally before and now the kid does it regularly. because when you're a kid you never think "oh shit i could have been hurt if dad wasn't there" you just think "awesome i can try to do a backflip off the swing set and i won't get hurt."
mom: "wow! i'm totally sucking your dick tonight."
"that ninja is going to steal those children. i want to help..... but i don't want to get out of my car."
yeah he was just trying to find the best solution. there's nothing about the way he acts that ever hints at "run" to me.
not a parent, not even that coordinated, but i was babysitting once and the 4-year-old climbed up on the back of the couch behind me. i realized something was wrong, whipped around, and grabbed his ankle as he took a header off the couch. stopped him like an inch before he would've cracked his skull into the stone floor.
they now owe that man a life debt. they shall follow him around until they can return the favor.
their parents are also his. he is dad for the entire family now
it definitely is. that backflip roll while holding the two kids is fucking nuts. this guy needs a dad payroll raise.
definitely. it's one of those things that if we saw it in a movie, someone could say "oh come on, that wouldn't happen." incredible.
yeah "is it going to miss? please miss. nope, gotta go in".
what was he trying to accomplish? push his kid down the ramp into that car?
no depth perception or balance. take a human, shrink them to a foot tall, and strip out all knowledge and ability to use the 5 senses. that's a baby.
judging by how many kids they have, he does this often.
that's just going to make the problem worse long-term.
hell yeah. something in our nature tells us to go out if our way to protect children. it's stronger, perhaps, as a parent, but when you're with a kid your mentality changes.
no they are tots. if they died they would be angels. according to the new york post
that's when you just start sending their family unprompted emails of things like the ps4, a new tv, etc. "hope the family is ok. what do you guys think of the ps4? never played one myself but it seems pretty awesome."
it's one of those ridiculous maneuvers that requires you to pass like 2 or 3 difficult rolls in a row to pull off. alright, perception check to see the car coming, reflex check to act in time, acrobatics check to get out of the way. 20, 20, 20
what's even more impressive is that he did that shit in fucking sandals. the feet shuffling, grabbing the kids, doing a backroll and maneuvering while keeping the sandals on is some next level dad shit.
someone should offer him a role in an action movie.
i'm in decent shape and i have no fucking idea how to do what he did. i'm pretty sure i'd have fallen backwards and all three of us would be dead.
i wonder if after... he was like, "hey, can i get a copy of that video? i don't think i'll ever be that badass again"
yeah, you don't want to be the guy who pile-drove two kids for a car that *didn't* smash through.
or in 5th edition, his passive perception was high enough to hear the car, then he rolled higher initiative than the car, succeeded on two dc 10 grapples and rolled two natural 20s on his acrobatics check (with disadvantage because he was holding kids) to get out of the way.
while reading this and sitting on the toilet my son just slid his pokemon playmat (for the card game) halfway under the bathroom door. he's insisting we battle while i'm still in the bathroom.
i doubt he knows how to do it either, he just did it
i actually quite like fifth. it's got an elegant trim as far as rules, without sacrificing all too much. definitely a hell of a lot better than 4, which was dnd in name only.
he's a master strategist, attacking when you're most defenseless.
i was standing around 6 or 7 feet from the top of my stairs and i see my son, about 18mos old, wonder towards the edge. in a split second he takes a step and is gone. without having any idea what i was doing, i leaped headfirst down the stairs from where i was standing. i managed to grab him halfway down the stairs before shit got real bad for him. when i realized what happened, i was laying headfirst in the middle of the stairs holding my son against the stairs. i'm still amazed at what i did whenever i'm standing in that spot looking at the stairs. seems impossible.
this is probably the right answer here. i was once really tired and walking without paying attention, walked into a low bench (just below my knee, for reference i'm 6'2) and started falling forward. next thing i knew i'm on my feet on the other side ready to keep going as if nothing happened, all i knew was my shin hurt like a mother fucker but nothing else did. asked my brother what happened and he said i did a roll over the bench.
oh we'll make sure this guy still gets sued somehow -usa
do people not like 5th? i haven't played any other editions but from what i can tell 5e is fantastic. the older versions just sound extremely convoluted, especially 3.5 with the something like 200 classes or whatever.
that's some sun tzu level strategy right there. appear weak when you are strong, appear strong when you are weak.
same thing kinda happened to me. i was gathering some fire wood with my brother because we were up in the mountains hanging out with some friends. next thing you know we hear a loud ass scream, not a normal scream of someone spooked, but a legitimate blood curdling scream. i end up dropping all my things and run toward the camp site, going around trees and jumping over shit, until i hit flat ground and ended up stepping in a hole which made me fall and bust my ass. somehow though i did a smooth roll and got onto my feet and took off again, i felt like a bad ass doing that, yet nobody saw it :( turns out there was just a big centipede crawling a foot or so away from her.
whoever runs next time has a hell of a slogan: hindsight is 20/20.
let's not forget that having a first past the post voting system gave us this mess. fuck the dnc and the rnc but also fuck the system that keeps them in power.
bernie practically had all the independents, but the dnc just had to have its golden girl as the candidate. and now all the advances we made on the liberal platform went to hell.
i said 8 years ago when obama was running against hillary in the primaries that if the dems make hillary the nominee, republicans could literally nominate a plank of wood and it would best her. this is the result of the massive hatred republicans have for clinton. this is their fault for letting her take this from bernie sanders.
i still remember people shitting on bernie while he was still in, saying hill was obviously the better option. where you at now you fucks.
conservative here. my sympathies. we differ in beliefs but he seemed like a genuine candidate.
my overall opinion of bernie aside, i 100% think it would have been a different game with him in there. it's a shame how the media and the dnc treated him.
good job shillary. good job debbie wasserman schultz. good job rigging the election you fucks. any other candidate would have been the easiest win in the history of america, but you forced a candidate down our throats.
good job, dnc. you played yourselves and fucked us all. you enormous pieces of shit.
those fucking idiots at the dnc who rigged it is the reason hillary lost. they chose the weaker candidate, and they deserve to lose because of their corruption and shitty choices. fuck the dnc. idiots.
this is what happens when you rig your primary. dnc is full of a bunch of fucking idiots. they even had the media push for trump during the primary as a "pied piper" candidate so clinton could win easier. look how that turned out. fuck them. the blame should be on their shoulders.
if hillary loses, she has to go down as the worst presidential candidate ever, simply because she lost to an absolute trainwreck in trump.
exactly fucking this. i remember early on during the primaries how god damn stuck up the hillary4president crowd were, talking shit and saying how they didn't want "berniebros" to vote for their candidate. there you fucking had it dnc. stealing the primary ~ rigging it against bernie, having superdelegates commit before any debating happened, having newyorks need to register 6 months before debates started to vote in the primary.. donna brazil colluding with clinton. their camp should have told donna to get fucked and said "we are too proud to try and steal this." taking wasserman schultz onto the clinton camp. fuck you. god i'm so angry right now i'm not even speaking straight. smug clinton assholes have fucked the people for months and now they are about to reap the damn consequences, and we are all going to suffer because of it.
from someone who was inspired by bernie enough to donate and volunteer for a presidential candidate for the first time in life: fuck you, dnc. fuck you, dws. you have no one to blame but your primary-rigging selves.
hillary wanted to win so badly she bet the entire country on it. bernie was the best shot we had but her greed was greater than her interest in the american people.
as a bernie supporter, the only satisfaction i get from trump winning is the despair of hillary, the dnc, and debbie wasserman schultz. you fucking stupid cunts, this is all your fault.
the dnc shot themselves in the foot when they didn't put up bernie sanders like the american people wanted. sander's would have won by a land slide against trump. the fools at the dnc wanted clinton and got her and lost bad for it. if they ever try this again, they will likely create a new third party over it.
i love how the dnc rigged the primary against bernie to put a weaker candidate in place which then shoots the party in its own fucking foot this is infuriating i cannot believe this
i feel like bernie was the only one of the candidates that actually cared about the people and the country.
michigan and wisconsin ...looks like they're going to be the deciding races. states bernie won in the primary. demi's have no one to blame but their corrupt establishment for rigging the primaries.
the republicans went with a candidate who-- for better or worse-- represented the values of their base. the democrats sabotaged their base's candidate and offered a robot in his stead.
the finger has to be squarely pointed at the dnc if trump wins.
on the bright side, the clinton dynasty is completely and utterly done. i voted bernie in the primary, and hillary in the general. so this is all not my fault!
but now we lose bernie a second time, this time as a budget affairs head guy...
this happens if you rig everything in favor of the unelectable candidate.
this is 100% on the dnc. they fucked over the bernie campaign and hired thugs to harass their supporters online (c t r), and they expect those same people to come out and vote for hillary?
i'll probably be sorry and delete this post in the morning since i'm drunk but, what exactly did the dnc expect? this is what happens when both candidates are equally as bad as each other but only one party screwed over their own voters. i had no horse in this race. my horse was shot at the gate and i got to vote independent in a relatively safe democratic state. i had no idea, due to the crt shills around here, that so many people felt the exact same way i did, only, apparently, they had the privilege to live in swing/red states, as far as the results say so far. to the dnc i can only say this: get fucked! you reap what you sowed. any canadian brothers out there, looking to help out an american "wife," hit me up on craigslist on wednesday, lol.
bernie vs ted would have been a much more meaningful race.
bernie was the first real politician in a long time who wore his heart on his sleeve. you could tell he loved his country so much, that he knew he had to be honest about what he believed in, and which direction he would have steered the us had he been elected as president. on the flip side, hillary won the primary, and was a clay candidate who would shape herself, and say, anything she needed to win. leaders are honest about their own convictions, and they stand up for their own beliefs, even when it's against the grain. here's to bernie 2020.
yup. sanders would have walked all over trump. it's too soon to call it but trump has a pretty serious lead right now and this is the fault of the neo-liberal dlc shitbags that have taken over the dnc.
yep. really, michigan and wisconsin cost $hillary the election. i voted for her (in the general only), but her rap sheet of corruption is 100 pages long. bernie's (non bullshit) stance on tpp would have easily won him michigan and wisconsin. hillary more electable? eat your words, hillary primary voters. like i said back then ... a vote for hillary in the primaries was a vote for president trump. fuck sake. now you realize ...
lol, hindsight. anyone who has actually payed attention to hillary the last 30 years knew she couldn't win against a wet towel. some thought a orange toupee was shit enough to win against, but it wasn't. it was not even a minority opinion of bernie supporters that this is what would happen. this is the same story i've been hearing since february at least. it was prophesied in fire in the sky but hillary supporters couldn't see what was in front of their face.
i said something similar. at the time, i'd conceded that hillary might even make a better president than obama. but, like you, it was obvious to me that she could never win a general election. she would have lost against dole, dubya, mccain, or romney... not a doubt in my mind. i thought trump might be able to take her down, but the "grab them by the pussy" video, i thought, was the end of him. nope. that's how much republicans hate her. they'll even take the sort-of-rapey guy over her.
they already collected their checks for their online manipulation "job"
damn, that bums me out, russ was one of the good guys. what happened to this election? did clinton really poison the well that much?
.democrats were arrogant after they turfed bernie . people don't want the establishment anymore . voters for trump by in large are just ordinary people fed up with the establishment and democrats entrenched them by belittling them at every turn . you became the establishment they fought against.
bernie would have won by a landslide. hillary had waaaayyyyy too much baggage dragging her down. any other republican candidate would have blown her out of the water already.
and they will all walk off into the sunset with their money bags wondering how everyone else messed things up.
that's very well put. she lost to *trump* for fuck's sake. a novelty candidate.
yeap, been saying this (and getting downvoted) for months now. this is absolutely the dnc / clinton's fault. if anything good comes from this, hopefully the dnc learns their fucking lesson and *respects* the voice of the people they claim to represent.
the dems literally cheated themselves out of a win.
haha remember when they kept hyping up clinton on her 'electability' hahahahahahaha
it really was sickening seeing how truly desperate she was to win, with bernie it felt like he was in it for us and not himself
as a johnson voter...bernie would have beaten trump.
it's interesting. there's not just a huge split in the dnc right now, but also in the gop. i honestly wouldn't be surprised if a new party (or two) takes the stage after this election.
i think sanders won in wisconsin and i know he won in michigan. can't be too surprised hillary is struggling there.
all the pollsters hrc's campaign hired you would think they would have figured that out. the dnc is a joke.
i'd love to say i told you so also, but if trump wins it looks like republicans are going to have the majority in the house, senate, and the president. that's new levels of scary i didn't really even consider happening tonight.
knives are being readied in the dnc now i hope. two years of this then a berniecrat landslide in the midterms.
they wanted hillary at any costs. elect clinton or die tryin'
the big money that owns the dnc and the media would rather lose with clinton than win with bernie.
their antics also cost them majority in the house as well. think last i heard it was a 92% of republicans holding the house. instead of a gridlocked trump, we are looking at a trump with power unless half the republican party does their best at obstructing him as well the next 4 years.
some networks have already called wisconson for trump
i'll be shocked if michigan goes r. it's close but detroit is yet to report. i have no idea about wisconsin.
michigan is slowly creeping towards clinton. wisconsin, my state, unlikely to be for hillary. if trump becomes potus i really wouldn't mind a blue senate.
i thought the gop hated trump and tried their hardest to replace him up to the primaries? it was only when he threatened to run as a 3rd party that he was able to wrangle the party into submission?
republican have to take the blame for trump winning their primaries by stoking their base with misinformation, and democrats have to take the blame for letting trump win the election by being corrupt and neglecting their base causing them to not show up. both parties fucked up. this is wholesale rejection of the current state of politics. this is what happens when you don't listen to the voters. i'm not saying any of this is the smart thing to do, but desperate people do desperate things.
what if trump gets sworn in and then immediately resigns...and explains how he only ran to prove he could win & to save america from the clintons
good morning, hope you aren't too fucked up from last night. the shilling was bad. they pulled funding, you can immediately see because of this 20000+ upvoted post.
with his own party against him he did as good as he did, imagine if they'd supported him.
i'd have liked an o'malley v kasich debate. they both seem like reasonable people who can articulate their points and have a meaningful, rational discussion.
the dnc, team clinton and the white house spent *years* making sure that clinton would be the nominee.
it's the fault of every democratic voter who voted in the primaries for an under-fbi-investigation corrupt uncharismatic candidate with uncountable skeletons in their closet. and the media and dnc for promoting that terrible candidate, colluding against the opposition, and forcing an extremely pro-establishment candidate into the general in a year defined by populism. hopefully they take a long hard look at themselves and finally reform. the dems, obama aside, have been getting their asses kicked all down the ballot for 20 years now.
during the primaries i tried to explain to hillary supporters that if she was nominated, that republicans wouldn't just crawl over broken glass to vote against her, you could set that broken glass on fire and they would still do it, with a smile on their face. i knew republicans and independents that were so excited to vote for bernie. not one of them would have even considered clinton. this was in n.c., btw.
dnc did, i think. nobody wanted to support the establishment by electing their people
absolutely she did, but not just her the dnc. people aren't going to be voting for a party that they think betrayed them. i mean everyone saw what the dnc did to bernie and vermont is bernie's home state. they couldn't have been happy about that. even though russ feingold was one of the good guys it doesn't matter to people's feelings.
all that baggage and it's still this close. bernie's squeaky clean record would have slid him straight into the oval office. even the specter of the word "socialism" wouldn't have stopped him.
seriously, i feel like all the fun being made of trump is what locked this in. people don't like being called retarded bigoted hillbillies, and they certainly don't vote your way. the only way clinton would win is if she and the dnc focused on the issues and pulled the mud slinging (he slung enough mud at himself honestly). if you forced him to defend his positions instead of allowing him to scream that the establishment is against him. he's winning *because* he was demonized, which made it easier for every right leaning voter to swing his way because they had an excuse to ignore their main news outlets.
i'm still tilted by sarah silverman saying the bernie bros were being "ridiculous" for not welcoming a politician they don't like with open arms.
an openly misogynistic, racist with **zero** political experience. yeah, hillary screwed the pooch big time.
as much as i'd love that. bernie will be 79 years old. that's a bit much. i'll just be happy with gabbard as president.
today's been brilliant. i have finally gotten over all the negative karma i had in all the political subs so i can comment more than once a half hour.
the thing that made me register democrat and try to get bernie as the candidate was when i saw that he voted against the 2008 patriot act. the guy believes in large government (which isn't necessarily something i agree with) but still was able to recognize that the patriot act was a trick and harmful to the people. that says so much to me about his interest in politics.
everyone is waiting. i suspect that tomorrow morning, people nationwide are going to start mobilizing to put berniecrats into local government.
seems like fucking him over and making fun of his supporters wasn't a good idea. who knew? also, fuck the dnc for helping clinton win the nomination against bernie. he would be destroying right now.
they don't care. they were willing to risk it, because bernie doesn't play ball with the establishment.
not to mentions likely two, possibly three, supreme court justice nominees.
yep. the point is control by the establishment. bernie is not on their team. a bernie victory in the general is a loss for the dnc.
a fucking republican trifecta with trump holding the reins. oh, ya don't forget the now republican supreme court. this is it... hold me.
fuck the stupid fucking dnc. i've been a registered republican for nearly 20 years and i changed my affiliation so i could vote for bernie in the primary. the dnc fucked their own party by rigging the primary and even helping push trump into the republican nomination because he'd be an easy foe. this is what you get you stupid fucking twats. i voted for gary johnson because fuck trump and fuck hilary - you smarmy bitches.
i mean honestly the dnc has known for decades that the public hates hillary. they tried to force her down our throats anyway. they could have picked any other party stooge (or bernie) and they would have won in a landslide.
i just hope this opens the door for a legit third party candidate in 2020. donors have to see the potential in finding a candidate that will laugh at both parties for the next four years.
i wish i weren't born so late and so soon. i work hard, i follow laws, so why do politics keep working against people like me?
then we have mike pence in control of the house, the senate, the supreme court, and the presidency.
bernie vs kasich would have been fantastic in my book. bernie vs trump has a nice symmetry to it in that they represent productive and unproductive solutions to anti-establishment, but with a bern vs kasich race i would have been fine with either winning.
absolutely. the problem is that their game plan is to be 1% less repugnant than the gop and therefore 'the lesser of two evils'. this was the anti-establishment election and amazingly the gop showed integrity that the democrats did not by honoring the wishes of their electorate.
this ass kicking has gone on longer than 20 years. since nixon, the democrats have shifted to the right and the further right they move, the worse off they are.
dnc fucked everything up. trump will most likely win and its the dncs fault.
exactly. her smug attitude towards voters, her taking states for granted that she thought she had locked, and her obviously lying about her email server is what did her in.
he had no organization, he was at war with the party, he was outspent big-time, ugh.
i'm with you on that. i love bernie but 79 that's a little too old. gabbard 2020!!
watching nbc right now and they are tripping over themselves to not say sanders "what if the candidate was biden?" "or sandwarren, i said warren i swear!"
yea he recognizes that "big government" and "effective government" are two minutely but critically different concepts.
i doubt it, i think after tomorrow people will just start bitching about trump and wait for the next election.
anyone not named clinton would have won in a landslide. imagine what the numbers would like if the ticket was sanders/warren.
his description of trump being used as a human molotov cocktail against the establishment sounds pretty spot on. well. fuck. good luck, everyone.
yeah this could be very bad. i don't want a party controlled government.
absolutely. amidst my disappointment about trump's likely victory, there's a strange sense of satisfaction coming from the fact that their vile, vile tactics worked against them. fuck you, debbie.
she was a puppet. the clintons have been maneuvering for a decade for this election. it's on them, not dws.
don't forget that the dems have been taking ethnic minorities for granted for decades because the republicans are either covertly or overtly racist. but cities with democratic mayors have just as many problems with police brutality against blacks as anybody else.
yeah at least bernie understood common gun owners being from vermont, a relatively gun friendly state without being "crazy" about it. like when hillary openly said gun manufacturers should be held at fault for mass shootings, might as well say ford and gm are at fault when a drunk driver is driving one of their rides and kills or seriously hurts an innocent person.
neither of these candidates personal quirks decided this election. this election was the result of people feeling disillusioned by their governments. this was a way of rejecting the "establishment" for many (despite many congressman holding their seats, so i guess we're fine with *that* establishment) but now it's the hard part: he has to run the establishment.
he said he'd only run if he thinks he's in good enough health. if he thinks so, i'll hop in board.
she will only be 39 with very very limited experience. i get that trump has fuck all experience, but people won't just turn to gabbard and not ask questions.
started blaming 3rd party voters as well. pathetic.
yeah i was watching on msnbc and as soon as i heard "bernie bros." out of tapper's snickering stupid mouth, i switched the video off.
i already know 2 people that became seriously involved in running for local office immediately after seeing the bullshit caucus experience. shit, **i'll** run, there's dozens of local and regional positions. something needs to change and it starts in our backyards.
the entire world. just as we have scientists worldwide telling us that we are at our last chance to damage control climate change the us elects a climate change denier. part of me is grateful that i'm already in my thirties and won't live long enough to see the worst of it, but it's a meager and selfish thought and i feel terrible for the next 2-4 generations.
think about what this means for the fighting climate change. the environment will be one big casualty to this. if we weren't already past the point of no return, we certainly will be now. it's going to be time for an end game strategy.
it's on all of them. they all share equal blame/responsibility.
no puppetry involved, the people at the top of the dnc willfully and purposefully rigged the primaries against bernie. this is the sort of arrogant myopia that led them to believe they could run things from the top, shove major changes down people's throats without their input, and still get endlessly elected because of incumbent advantage and gerrymandering. pride always cometh before the fall.
she used to be staunchly against gay marriage (even more than hillary was). in a democratic party dominated by bernie-like voters, that wouldn't fly.
exactly. if obama wasn't the second coming of jesus for blacks then what would hillary be? turns out blacks were a lot less on the clinton side than ever before and it showed in the polls.
as a gun owner in a closed-primary state, i urged undecided democrat friends to vote for bernie, and would have happily voted for him over trump. could not bring myself to vote for hillary over trump.
i think 2020 bernie is probably healthier then trump now
clinton couldn't beat trump.. donald fucking joke trump. do not blame third party voters msnbc. this is such a shit show that i saw coming from months away.
have faith in the brightest minds of human kind. science and economics will find a way. the days of accessible greener (and cheaper) energy may be closer than you think.
oh fucking boy kay, well, britain actually managed to basically save themselves from brexit, it seems. do we have any realistic mechanisms to alleviate this damage?
this is going to be a 4-year nightmare bud so strap in.
what control(s) do the ppl have to correct bernie being defrauded?
i have been a long time libertarian, since i became fed up with the republicans diving head first into iraq for no reason, and the whole "freedom fries" level of politics. i would have been ok with a bernie presidency. i would loathe either hillary or donald. reddit though, they have no idea. bring up a white, middle to lower class voter from a fly over state. "fuck you you racist trash, i hope you die in a gutter." that's the attitude i have seen on this website. people have watched their livelihoods melt away, and the democrats offered virtually nothing. so of course people reached out to a loudmouthed biggot who said, "hey, over here. i'm with you guys."
the main german news programme (tagesschau) just described it as "the biggest set of data journalists have ever laid hands on". (given that a german newspaper received the documents first and did most of the groundwork (which op has just linked to), i guess it was published at 8pm cest to coincide with the main tagesschau broadcast of the day.)
great to see a real score for investigative journalism here. there's life in the old dog yet in this click-bait world.
biggest leak in the history of data journalism, according to snowden. and it's about corruption. this is great news.
the real trick is getting people to care en masse so something can actually be done to fix it.
this *could* be one of the biggest and most important leaks of all time. maybe finally people will wake up and realise that the entire world economic system is completely corrupted.
i think it's incredibly telling, that none of the major american news outlets (cnn, nbc or politico) have anything about this on their websites. i would at least expect some small article mentioning what's happening, but there is literally nothing at all!
this is incredible - there is potentially enough data there to keep even the most skilled forensic data experts busy for years. who knows what will tumble out. that said, i hate to be cynical, but can't see how this will ever fully be investigated or reported by newspapers owned by many of the wealthy conglomerates likely to be exposed here.
so.... are you guys going to go riot or what? i need to go to bed early tonight, but i'll stay up if you're going to get all smashy-smashy.
this is the most terrifying thing i have read in a long time. whilst i dont think much of the bildeberg or the illuminati conspiracies, that all these influential individuals use one firm, to hide their wealth, do corrupt deals, and influence the world in such a large way, makes me wonder how many other firms just like this there are who have not had documents leaked. the world is truly screwed
it's always somewhat disappointing when information like this comes out. not because i feel bad for the companies, but a lot of folks often feel there's some sort of global corruption ring, explicit or implicit, tied up in international finance and such. and the disappointment comes from when that is absolutely correct - that such corporations defy our brighter visions and ideals in their pursuit of financial gain. hopefully there's some significant fallout from this.
a quick look - this is all over bbc, the guardian, le monde, the irish times websites. front, huge font. it is nowhere on nytimes, cnn, fox, msnbc, cnn, usatoday, la times. it is astonishing how pacified the us is. just astounding. it's not because the citizens are dumb and uneducated. they've just been trained not to care. unreal. it's like an alternate universe.
is there a way to keep a story on the front page for a while longer than normal for world affecting instances such as this? like a sticky post for a week?
i have a feeling that all the news in america will do some in depth reports on kim kardashian the day this is released.
i wonder if any incredibly wealthy prospective us presidential candidates might be implicated in this... just when the campaign was getting a bit quiet.
this has the potential to be equivalent to the snowden leaks, but equally the public could lose interest pretty quickly. hopefully the former happens, and all those involved are prosecuted.
hopefully this means we will see anti-corruption actions lasting weeks with new revelations to keep them going, instead of the paltry days we usually see after public outrage.
and they kept it quiet. which is pretty fucking impressive.
lol we've been complaining about how the quality of journalism has gone downhill in recent years...they've all just been working on this!
it pretty much sounds like they had a document management system. such a system is basically a database connected to a file store.
interesting that the source doesn't ask for money or anything on return. they just wanted to leak it. imagine what kind of person would do this and what they must be feeling right now. an idealist? someone pushed too far? someone who just wanted to throw it out there and watch the chaos? if this puts those criminals on prison then i see a movie about this story in a few years.
i didn't realize the scale of the journalistic effort. wow.
i'd really like there to be a huge fallout from this but the cynic in me is thinking that things will go on as normal. the only change is they might get better at hiding.
this is really big. people only pay attention to the immediate fallout, but this could have repercussions for decades
for a moment i wondered why the did it in such massive collaboration. then i realized, if they do it alone, they get assassinated. who thinks i'm wrong?
maybe this is why no one except the australian paper has been covering the unoil scandal.
it will be interesting to see how much the bbc decide to report on this considering they for some reason have refused to report on the unaoil bribery scandal (i know these 2 stories are unrelated but not reporting on unaoil really makes me doubt their supposed impartiality).
right.. but how do we actually *do anything* when everyone we've put into a position of power is corrupt? seriously though.
how we gonna punish the people who run the world?
taxes sure do suck, right? imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? after all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. one method for lowering profits, is to increase spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, or you can "spend" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. what has been happening in panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. this accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.
i'm looking at argentina. those people don't fuck around when it comes to civil unrest.
give it a day or two to set in. prepare for world cup level riots tomorrow night. probably a good idea to take off work tuesday.
i'm sure his news media interests will shift the blame to all of his jealous western enemies and such.
apparently americans are completely absent from the papers that have been leaked so far. that doesn't mean we'll hear more later as more of the papers are leaked.
at some point, if stuff like this keep being publicized, it has to blow up. it's like water boiling in a cauldron: you can take off the cover once in a while, but unless you turn the heat down by adressing the root cause of the boiling, shit's gonna happen one day.
when your life may be in very real immediate danger i would imagine you're a lot more careful
well they're journalists. it's pretty common for them to shut up about sources etc.
its still gone way down hill. investigative journalism didn't get a financial boost, someone dropped a load in their laps.. that's not 'improving". its as much improving as winning the lotto is earning money by hard work. the problem was never the journalist,, kinda hard to be too investigative, when so much access is closed off, whistleblower laws silence people and the industry just doesnt fund investigation journalism.. its more expensive than trash and yet you make the same money for trash. this is free non trash for the price of trash.
i'm thinking that maybe the very public salaries for athletes in the us might deter them from trying to stash that shit overseas? i'm not sure how it is with soccer overseas, but over here player salaries and endorsements are so publicly known i'd imagine that the irs wouldn't have the most difficult time figuring out that something was off.
us citizens would probably be handled differently and on a different data set.
this is all just an elaborate plot to promote the hell out of rush hour 7:border control starring jackie chan vladimir putin and lionel messi.
this political cycle if both hillary and trump are implicated... @.@ you gif hoarders, throw me my lawn chair.
i'm a bernie supporter, but man imagine that bernie is involved in this!? that would be hilarious
if nothing comes out about us politicians, i'm guessing that is a cia leak. the main focus of the leak has been putin, for starters
this needs to be higher. i've always felt that hillary is corrupt as hell but shit like this is borderline treason.
there will be a protest tomorrow. as an icelander i feel sick and very, very angry.
my thoughts too. to me iceland stood as the single bright example of functioning democracy after 2008. maybe he was a straight guy when he took office and got bought up? is the implementation of representative democracy and parliamentarism, whos principles and values we cherish, in reality just an theatrical act maintained to give us the illusion of freedom and choice?
it's really crazy. the sueddeutsche said something along 'this is so big, one agency can't handle it and especially can't handle it well enough to inform the people in the way it should. therefore we set up the whole thing'. i'm mean oh my god how fucking awesome is this? they actually realized that this is far bigger then them and thus create the largest journalistic alliance i can think of! it's really time to get the popcorn ready. i can imagine people on the list willing to do almost everything to get their name off the list asap... i wonder how much corruption will be leaked as well or bribe attempts. what is kind of funny is that the prime minister of the only country who jailed banksters after the last big crash is involved and actually one of the first to be named...
this is actually fascinating, given the usual reddit sentiment that the mainstream media doesn't report on anything that could harm their corporate masters. really curious as to how this was coordinated and how it plays out
that's someone's brain going internally "oh shit oh shit oh shit".
wow. if anyone has any doubts watch this video. holy wow.
reminds me exactly of how child-sex offenders act on "to catch a predator" when it hits them that they're fucked.
if we learned anything from the snowden incidents, it's that people don't care enough about global industry to do anything about it. as long as they still get their tv shows and iphones and beef burgers, they could be living in a dictatorship for all they cared.
ok, call me cynical, but the only one that's shocking is the pm of iceland. none of those other countries strikes me as on the level so to speak. oh, the president of argentina and the president of ksa are corrupt? color me surprised...
the leak consists of documents from a law firm whose business seems to be setting up shell companies for the rich and powerful over the last few decades. there are millions of documents and the crimes involved are everything from tax evasion to the slave trade. it's like the fappening, but for accountants.
also, you need the entire world to talk about it. and even then, there's only a slim chance that it will actually chance anything. this is the new global "royalty".
the hitchhiker's guide quote seems relevant: "on its world, the people are people. the leaders are lizards. the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people." "odd," said arthur, "i thought you said it was a democracy." "i did," said ford. "it is." "so," said arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, "why don't people get rid of the lizards?" "it honestly doesn't occur to them," said ford. "they've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want." "you mean they actually vote for the lizards?" "oh yes," said ford with a shrug, "of course." "but," said arthur, going for the big one again, "why?" "because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said ford, "the wrong lizard might get in. got any gin?"
take to the streets and start giving them holy hell each time they are out. make them live in virtual prison for the heat they catch in public, hell most of the beltway criminals are already all-but hostages to the consequences of their political agendas.
oh, so it's basically just tax evasion? what will be the long-term implications of this?
super important. i hear there are no us names in the leak and see nytimes, cnn, fox, msnbc, cnn, usatoday, & la times not covering it and my mind immediately jumps to "at least one of the owners is probably on the list and they're trying to suppress it." but in the end, they could simply be collecting their facts. running a story you have no info on just because someone else ran it is dangerous to a news organization's credibility. i'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
still nothing on front page of cnn, msnbc, yahoo, fox news, etc...
not just sources - but the fact that this goes so deep and we've heard nothing across possibly hundreds of platforms is certainly impressive.
i think you're underestimating the work that went into this. someone didn't just knock on their door and drop off all of this data. the journalists involved had to build trust with whoever leaked the information. they also had to ensure they had the means to protect that person's identity. and that doesn't even count the year they spent going through millions of documents, indexing them, and making sense of it all.
tax accountant here. doesn't really matter that their salaries are known at all. c-levels of publicly traded companies have publicly available salaries too. income tax from salary would be easy to catch, but any investments they made with the leftovers wouldn't, and that's where the big money is anyway.
interesting theory. but what about us businessmen, politicians, etc? clean? seems... unlikely.
if so we'll hear more soon. no need to rush to judgement, but it's something to keep in mind and ask about. all things being equal, i'd expect americans to be all over this list.
if so, expect kremlin to leak something similar about u.s. politicians shortly. if that doesn't happen, you were probably wrong. in fact, if that doesn't happen the info probably doesn't exist because putin will be looking for absolutely *any* way to change the subject right about now regardless of the source of the leaks. eta: the inclusion of jordanians, saudis and others known to cooperate closely with us intelligence makes it further unlikely that cia is the source of this. still, i will be interested to see what the kremlin comes up with because they have every reason in the world right now to say, hey, we are no worse than the americans, if they can.
i wonder if he will face any kind of legal charges for this, but i'm he guessing won't.
put on the good shit too. like the stuff tarantino buys
not that i'm advocating hauling the guy out of his house and chucking him into one of those ridiculously long-named volcanoes you guys have up there, but this sounds like the kind of thing that would justify hauling the guy out of his house and chucking him into a volcano.
so, they took the tax money from people who don't own homes and gave that tax money to people with homes?
or they thought that if just one outlet reported this then putin would have the staff poloniumed, he can't kill every journalist connected to this now it's this big.
how it plays out? if this gets even bigger, more companies like mossack fonseca get revealed, there will be a sudden end to it. it will be when people from the leading countries will get involved..imho.
you could literally see his stomach tying in knots, the weird adrenalin/fear surge through his body and the fight or flight impulse takeover with flight winning. the only thing missing is if his voice would have risen higher.
you aren't kidding. total lack of a poker face there.
just remember, he won't be sorry he did it, he's sorry he got caught.
xi jinping is a huge one as well. he has been on a massive anticorruption drive in china, jailing people and seizing assets.
mubarak was worth 70 bil and gaddafi was worth 200 billion. theres business rich than theres dictator/king/not on forbes list rich
all things considered he might be the most powerful man in the world given his autonomy compared to other world leaders/billionaires
the world is maybe now talking about it. 100 papers, different countries. but yeah if there is no follow up by the media in the way they started it. the river they might have created will just be a bad smelling lake of unfollowed chances...
i'm reminded of this from hitchhiker's: the major problem - one of the major problems - for there are several - one of the many major problems with governing people is that of who you get to do it. or, rather, of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. to summarise: it is a well-known and much lamented fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. to summarise the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should, on no account, be allowed to do the job. to summarise the summary of the summary: people are a problem.
it's not just tax evasion. it's using shell companies to skirt international law and launder money. people were using this company to get around arms embargoes and shit like that. people actually died because of this shit.
yeah. all the places running the story seem to be news organizations that were involved in the initial research, so they've had about a year to work on it in secret. trying to cover a story involving that much research accurately in a few hours is going to be pretty much impossible. another possibility is that all these news organizations aren't covering this *because* of the lack of us names in the leak. there would naturally be far more interest in this story in countries that are directly impacted by it, so if there doesn't appear to be any us names on the list (for whatever reason), then a lot of americans are unfortunately probably not as interested.
incredibly impressive. 400 people over a year and this is the absolutely first time we've heard of this.
it would be awesome if this led to real journalism making a comeback.
also just because they are on this list doesnt necessarily mean they did anything illegal. legal tax avoidance is a cottage industry and everyone knows it. exhibit a apple google amazon facebook etc with their offshore profit. worse come to worst, messi and others will just make some charitable donations to under privileged communities to repair their pr image.
is there any scenario here where putin is at any risk of losing control of russia? he will just carry on, throw a few more oligarchs in prison. bau.
well, it's not a leak about global corruption, it's about a very specific company so we don't really have the whole picture. i wouldn't be surprised if germans / us citizens used another company or different loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
you know what's on my mind right now? it ain't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the leaked data on the internet.
it was the glacier that had the silly name. the actual volcano was called dave or something
no, most media outlets are about ratings and most of the time it makes sense to fall in line with their sponsors/corporate interests, but there comes a time when a story is too good to ignore. this has the potential to be like that. no one wants to bite the hand that feeds them, but if that hand turns out to be your favorite meal...
the closeup on the lip quiver. this guy is fucked.
it will end up being all about the celebs & footballers.
i've heard estimates that the saudi royal family is collectively worth something like 1.2-1.4 *trillion* dollars. the rothschilds are rumored to be up in that stratosphere as well.
not really. he has to answer to the military if nothing else, and i'm sure any number of high-ranking officials, businessmen, and international figures. there is no such thing as an absolute ruler--even in dictatorships there are still politics. otherwise we'd see much more successful dictatorships!
the solution is to choose leadership from the unwilling to serve in areas that befit their technical knowledge. a technocracy if you will.
wait, explain to me how/why people died for this? i don't understand. thank you
what the actual fuck... that is kind of suspicious.
no kidding. i don't see any coverage at all on thier home page.
+sipping morning coffee while answering the phone+ what's that? oh, a quick meeting downstairs. allrighty... i'll just grab... oh?!! won't be needing them? what?! ever? what do... ok. wait! i'll come down there.
the new york times held onto the story where bush and the nsa were spying on americans without a warrant for a year before leaking it in 2005.
messi could set an orphanage on fire and still be popular
hey, maybe we'll break the yellow journalism cycle for a little bit. i'm so excited at the potential this has
i didn't even notice that the first time around but goddamn. that man is scared.
i love how the camera guy got set up to catch every aspect of this guys face. great work camera guy!
myself being an englishman, i'd like to see tony blair get it.
exactly. nobody is going to persuade me that bill gates or some such is the wealthiest man on earth, while there are trillions in tax havens and banks and we all know that the money gravitates to the wealthiest people.
one morning, checking your email: "congratulations, you've been selected to be the next president of the--" you: "oh goddamnit."
it's still early, but it looks like you can use these anonymous companies to send/launder money discreetly across borders this circumventing embargoes or sanctions. looks like some of this was used in arms sales as well as drug & sex trafficking.
it's a law that requires every financial institution in the world with a "us person" as a client to disclose financial info about that client to ensure that they are complying with the citizenship-based taxation that the us has. there's a whole bunch of provisions to it and incentives for ratting people out, but a lot of foreign banks won't take us clients
iceland has done things to people who cheat the masses only a few years back. things beyond holding a hearing and asking for a minimal fine. this dude goin to jail, yo.
the saudi royal family is comprised of thousands of people, the rothschild family has hundreds of descendants. collectively they may be the most wealthy families in the world, but their fortunes are split between hundreds/thousands of members. bill gates is (probably) richer than any single member of any of these wealthy families.
bill gates isn't the richest man - he's the richest man to play somewhat straight. e: don't get me wrong, microsoft was an absolutely ruthless corporate predator under his stewardship. but it still wasn't a criminal organization. that's what sets gates apart from people richer than him; those people who hide tens of billions of dollars in panama probably earned them doing shady shit.
this is the shit we see in movies. a secret society. just without a cool shadowy name.
i admit i thought the water situation in flint had already been taken care of due to the lack of news coverage and reddit posts.
it's kinda hard to forget about when you live here.
so serious question....what can we do about this? its my understanding that the piping for water is so fucked and it would cost so much that it would be cheaper to get up and move the entire town. like honestly besides trucking in bottled water (which i really hope they do that at least), what can we do? i feel horrible for these people. im not trolling i am looking for an actual response, anyone out there understand this enough to give me a break down?
i really can't imagine what these people are going through. imagine working your whole life to buy a home to raise a family. now, the water is tainted and the property value must be essentially zero. nobody is buying houses in flint. these people have no way out and every day the value of houses they have to keep paying for is going down and down.
i can't believe it's actually been almost 3 years!
crazy that gallowboob gets 88k karma and double gold for a reposted image of someone holding a sign... a fucking sign.
idk, maybe, just maybe people should start focusing on their local governments and elected officials instead of the president.
in america you would think that doesn't exist. most third world countries go through that daily.
instead of "don't forget" posts to remind people, why not include why there is no water. whose fault is it that this hasn't been fixed yet? obviously the city is still inhabited and functioning, but for some reason someone just hasn't green lighted the "fix it" operation. lets bring that person back into the light!!! that is surely more productive than "it still sucks for people".
if a city in a first world country can't even provide clean water for its citizens after 3 years, they are no longer worthy to be a city in a first world country. everything in the town should be dissolved, and the city/state should be providing the residents with fair compensation for their moving expenses. put a nail in the coffin, and ensure that those who are responsible for this happening and not being fixed are held accountable for those actions. money can't fix everything, and they have spent entirely to much trying to solve this problem without success.
it's 2017 and flint still isn't the most affected american town with lead in their water. flint is just well known.
should've made it a blonde white girl, then fox news would be all over it.
friend of mine is a doctor at a hospital in pa, they get a ton of lead poisoning cases because their water is, i guess, even worse than flint's. it's amazing that there are multiple places with such terrible water in the united states.
city officials wanted to get off the flint river supply when they found out that its levels of chlorine were high enough to be corrosive and harmful. the emergency manager vetoed them, which lead to the corrosive chlorine stripping mineral buildup from the lead pipes. exposed metal then leeched into the water, spurred on by the still-corrosive water. those officials who knew but kept it quiet are being prosecuted. the governor was being investigated, last i heard, but republicans shut it down. state officials are blaming the federal government for not being more involved in their business. it's politics as usual.
psa: not sure if people realize but you must confirm your signature after you sign. they send an email for confirmation so putting a fake email address will not help the petition.
not defending what happened in flint but it's a huge infrastructure project to replace the water mains; even in the best case scenario it would take a long time to fix the problem once it was discovered.
nobody has cared about flint for decades, it's a really fucked up situation. for all the bad rap that detroit has gotten the past 40 years flint has always been worse off and nobody talks about it at all.
that is how sensationalist news covers things, it is one surprising headline after the other and old news doesn't catch headines like the latest celebrity gossip does.
if you don't mind me asking, what's keeping you and your family there? i'm genuinely curious about the circumstances of you living there.
as a pitt student how worried about getting lead poisoning should i be
they need to replace every pipe in the city. that's not going to happen very quickly during a michigan winter.
yep. that's nuts. we can only hope wherever we buy our own a house the water is safe..
ok, donny boy. you're in charge now. so whatcha gonna do to fix it?
i'm sure that the people of flint are thinking the same thing
congratulations, you just created a strategy for politicians to move populations they don't like, companies to get no-bid contracts to move them from their friends in the government, and an incentive for state and municipal governments to repeat the mistakes and crimes that caused the flint water crisis in the first place.
so then the federal government should control all local populations from the top level down, and abolish any towns that don't conform to their agenda? basically get rid of local government and hand everything over to a central authoritarian federal government? have you ever studied government or civics at all?
barely. per wikipedia: on december 9, 2016 the mdeq reported more than 96 percent of water samples tested at high-risk flint homes in november 2016 were below the federal lead threshold of 15 parts per billion. so basically, all the water is safe to shower/bathe/wash dishes/water your garden with, but in 4% of the homes you should use a filter for water for drinking and cooking. i filter my drinking water anyway.
i would say maybe bail out any residents/businesses that are currently trapped in mortgages or leases that they can't afford to break. negotiate with the banks to give em 50-60% the value of their loans on the affected residences. we end up with a ghost town, but maybe someone can come in that could find a use for the land. build a nuclear plant. i don't know.
not me. i upvoted this picture on reddit. *** *** for just $3.99 on reddit, you can help us turn lead into gold. give generously.
i heard a report on the news last night that new jersey has a problem now due to lead lined pipes. to go a little off topic the bridge connecting pa and nj turnpikes is closed due to a structural crack. this is the infrastructure that is crumbling around all of us.
yeah, it's the republicans, guys. forget about the almost entirely democratic local government because it can't be them.
i'm not american so forgive me if this is a ridiculous question. why does it seem like that anything nasty or obviously wrong that politicians do in the us is seemingly almost always done by the republicans?
the second paragraph highlights the actual reason why the flint crisis lost coverage. multiple articles came out about all the other places with elevated lead problems. it became such a circus of "hey look at my lead poisoning, it's not just flint" that the actual urgency and importance of the flint crisis waned. basically, enough cities claimed to have lead problems that it became normal, in a sense. the sensationalism was taken out, and with it went the national attention and urgency.
the thing is, old news isn't news at all. if you open a newspaper, it will give you information of new things happening at present. maybe some opinion piece or in-depth article might discuss an issue that isn't new, but that's not "news coverage" anyway.
i just read last week that the water is normal in flint now. but people are still being given bottles water anyway. and that flint isn't the only town in the us where lead levels in the water are unacceptable and illegal. nobody cares about those towns.
i actually have it much better than many because i live near my parents who have well water. there are places all over to get free bottled water if it's needed and even home delivery in some cases. it's far from ideal because almost every day you will still see folks who don't have transportation lugging cases of water down the street. it's messed up and i count my blessings that i only have to drink bottled water and don't need to cook or wash up with it.
yeah i'm curious too, how do these people live? boil everything? bottled water?!?!
like a lot of people it's a combination of many things, family, finances and being stubborn has a lot to do with it, but i love this city and the people here. i was born here most of my family was born here. if given the option to go somewhere else it would probably be a very hard decision. we don't have much but it's ours and even when it's in a place of violence and poverty a lot of us still try to make the best of it.
this is what they should do. can be done quickly and gets people water while the infrastructure is replaced over time.
unfortunately they might have to do what migrants do. leave their community and face a new world somewhere else where they can create new lives. that sucks so bad man.
wait, so some people bought houses while this was going on? not a lot, but some. wtf?
get rid of the epa and clean water standards. than flint water won't be in violation of anything. this is easy. why you didn't think of it loser. sad!
they need to escort rick snyder to a cell with steel bars.
i've actually read a comment on a previous thread saying it's probably cheaper to build a new city from scratch than fix flint. the situation as i understand it is that, in order for the problem to be resolved all the pipes in the city need to change completely, every house amd every apartment etc.. i could be wrong though, probably am.. it sounds absurd
i think you just took his comment to an extreme that he wasn't even thinking about
i showed my support of your support by upvoting you.
that wasn't really him drinking the water as much at it was him taking a sip. i'm not saying the water isn't safe when filtered. i'm no expert, but i do trust them that that is the case. what i do know is that changing the pipes isn't a process that happens overnight, and the filters seem like a reasonable measure till that process is done.
he was paid by big filter for that whole video (/s) no but for real, why didn't he fix this problem?
so, does the city pay for the filters that have to be used to drink the water? if not, that sounds really terrible still. even with a filter, obama didn't really even do anything but wet his lips with that water. very reassuring.
yeah that's a huge sip there! lips touched wet and adoring press will call that a sip. very reassuring!
so why doesn't nj do something about their infrastructure?
you would think that should've made it a bigger crisis.
i'd argue that an ongoing health crisis is not "old news".
no one cares is the unfortunate truth, as long as the majority has what they need to be comfortable they don't need to worry but someone rich gets hit by a natural disaster and suddenly they a brave, strong heros. them and their multi million dollar insurance pay out.
if you boil water with lead in it and don't collect the steam as condensation... you still have water with lead in it. unfortunately they have to advertise this on billboards in flint because people were doing that for a while.
bottled water. also stores sell purified water. i just shower with the water as it comes out. its very highly chlorinated, and probably lead(ed?). oh well. i get cancer so be it. nothing i can really do about it. too poor to move.
now i don't know anything about how the american government works, but is the cleanliness of water in flint a problem at the federal level or should aybe the michigan government or local government handle this?
in all fairness, that's a very reasonable response. the issue should be resolved at a local level.
just because the idea was intended to do good doesn't mean that someone can't find a way to abuse it. he did take it to the extreme but what's going to stop someone else from taking advantage of the rule in a way that wasn't thought of? i think in theory what the original comment said is a good idea but unfortunately we always have to be skeptical of our government officials because they've shown in the past that they aren't trustworthy and are only interested in what is best for them instead of what's best for their constituency.
i'd like to donate $5 to help them get clean water and another $5 to sue the hell out of the city officials for allowing this to continue for 3 years.
it takes a long damn time to dig up pipes and flint needs to replace a lot of them from what i have heard but still if the government took this seriously it would be done by now.
what we did to clean the source only made it worse, which is rare. as an employee of one of the companies cleaning it up i can assure you that if you live anywhere in the united states that your water isn't much better. i have seen violent levels of lead and no one says a word to the people. even as much as 10x allowed legal limits of other contaminants, and the town makes efforts to sweep it under the table.
even if the city paid for it, the money comes from the people.
ahhh makes sense. granted the city wanted to save money, with the bureaucratic shuffling they could have taken the short term deal with detroit while waiting to clear the local supplier.
i'm sure it's covered in the local newspapers. nationally (or internationally, in my case), it's not news. they'd have to be able to update it in some way for it to be news, and from where i'm sitting it looks like the headline would be a perpetual "flint water still toxic", which isn't a news update.
i don't think it's so much not caring as it is busy working and putting food on the table and making sure their teenage daughter isn't sexting [edit comma: "," - their daughter is not the one at the bar] and drinking at the corner bar and questioning their sexuality and going home with some random tranny then regretting it later and getting a divorce because their wife won't accept who they are as a person then losing their job, not paying alimony and ending up living in a van down by the river. people care.
damn dude that sounds rough, can't believe something like that can even happen in the us
ha! a bailout for the people? what are you a socialist?!?!
state or local. it's amazing this hasn't been fixed yet, but it's hardly a federal issue. although it has become a federal talking point.
i dont think the local government has the capability to fix it. the state or federal government needs to step in and actually put out the cash n3cesaary to fix the problem
i dunno, maybe after three years it's time for the federal government to ask "what the hell is taking so long?" fema is already involved and obama authorized federal funds, so we've already been involved at the federal level anyway. it's not getting solved at the local level.
exactly, i don't think people understand the the president can't put out every little fire (i understand it's a big one) but local gov't needs to get this shit together because they're the ones who made it happen in the first place.
transgender, transracial. s/he/they/xe is a hero/ine.
has anyone been sued? if not, why haven't the people been represented yet? i'd imagine they might be able to secure a decent settlement
its not the main pipes which are the problem anymore, its the lead pipes in peoples homes. the problem is 96% fixed the last bit is just people not wanting to replace their pipes cause it costs a shittonne.
so replace them with competent officials to send a message and fix it anyway because people need water
case in point, look at delta airlines. they had an issue where they configured a pdu/battery backup/generator wrong in their data center, and *poof*! suddenly they lose $150m in revenue. that's how important your it department is.
they were on the detroit supply, but detroit raised their rates because of their *own* financial issues. because of this they were going to tie into another supply, but detroit refused to grandfather their existing rate until construction completed. because of that, they were going to use their back-up supply with the flint river. iirc when the water issues came to light, detroit did in fact offer to hook them back up until the construction was finished, but i don't know how that played out.
as a little kid i asked my parents if they ever played reruns of the news. they laughed.
those stories keep the attention on officials and help resolution though.
i thought about this the other day. what if all cell phones suddenly quit working? it would be mass chaos. just one thing out of the equation can cause utter chaos.
welp. we take a lot of refugees here i germany. you might wanna come over
dont be fooled, many places in the us are basically a third-world country, but we have midtown manhattan and beverly hills so people think its all rich and glamorous.
in the us, only failures are socialized. profits are still privatized.
no, businesses and banks are people. except of course when they're not.
the failure of the state government to solve the problem should have made it a federal issue about a year ago.
this is my thought. if the city doesn't have the funds to completely overhaul their water distribution systems, it's up to the state or washington to step up and help the people of flint. no american should live in a city that can't even provide the basic necessity of clean water. i don't know if they could just declare a state of emergency and get a shitload of funds to do something, or what, but *something* needs to be done. 3 years of lead contaminated water with no end in sight is fucking atrocious.
don't you think the people that let the problem happen in the first place should be the ones paying for it? people definitely broke laws letting this happen and they need to be charged like fuckin anyone else
my challenge to everyone is to not start laying this at trump's feet immediately. considering the fact that obama really didn't do anything about it (because the president can't really solve state's problems without being asked), don't start calling trump a racist and saying he doesn't care about black people because of this.
but if he's cutting federal funding to cities that act as sanctuaries for illegal immigrants, why can't he do the same to cities that can't provide safe drinking water to residents?
do not donate to the american red cross. they suck ass. a friends company donated thousands of decks of playing cards to them and guess what they did? sold them to the military. sold them. profited off a donation. this is not the only sketchy thing they've done either.
should they have to pay? their water was drinkable before, albeit precariously on the edge of toxic if the deposits on the pipes dissolved (as they have), but to have to cough up the money to re-plumb their entire house?? we *are* talking about flint, michigan here. most of these folks aren't rolling in cash as it is.
news companies aren't in the business of keeping the attention of officials and resolving problems. they're in the business of selling stories that people want to read about.
eh... katrina was pretty mad max. cops turning their guns on refugees trying to escape the city? yeah.
i'm not sure how old you are but i can remember life before cell phones. it was not much different aside from if you told someone you were going to be somewhere at a certain time then you bloody well should make sure you're there because i'm giving you 5 minutes before i bail
well i mean many people also live in these areas that are *very* first world (that aren't the two places you listed) so it's relatively easy to be "fooled" if you live in a bubble. they've just never been somewhere like atlanta's trap or south side chicago or gary indiana
don't go that far. it sucks to live in flint but compared to places in africa where they walk miles to a well just to get contaminated water...
the epiphany i had was actually kind of sad. that really describes it really well. would you say it's like how taxpayers foot the bill for failing casinos?
you can't just make something a federal issue because a state sucks at doing it. can you imagine the clusterfuck that would create? there are divided responsibilities between local, state, and federal authorities for a reason.
there's tons of cities that face the same problem as flint though. or something very similar. not to downplay flint's tragedy or anything, but it's not like the fight is over once they're taken care of.
to be fair, i am most definitely not calling trump a racist and saying he doesn't care about black people because of flint, michigan.
so we cut funding to cities that need funding the most? it's 'no child left behind' all over again!
honestly if they sold them to buy actual supplies that would help victims in a crisis i wouldn't even mind.
and therein lies much of the problem: the press is supposed to hold the government and the powers that be accountable, at least if we intend our democracy to remain healthy and, well, a democracy. but as they are in the *business* of journalism rather than the *profession* of journalism, they report on what people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. it's not all "the people get what they want," there's a very powerful effect that goes the other way: the people want what they get.
i still bail after 5 minutes now. some asshole friends of mine are notorious for being late but constantly texting you stuff like "2 minutes away" or "i'm parking right now!", and 45 minutes to an hour later they finally show up. so i've learned to just leave after 5 to 10 minutes
why do you think trump doesn't want to release his tax returns? doesn't want us to see the clever accounting that earned him piles of money that he doesn't actually need.
can't you, though, if the state government lacks the necessary resources and lives are at stake? i was under the impression that was one of the implications of declaring a state of national emergency.
well, yes? it's not pretty on your purse but what's the alternative - cities of the usa without safe drinking water? that is a reality but it shouldn't even be science fiction.
exactly. in my hometown we got a letter for 2nd year in a row that says not to drink the water if your a baby, elderly, or immune deficient. then in the next sentence they say the water is still ok though.
maybe divert some of those dod dollars to shoring up america's infrastructure?
you literally can't. kanye liked trump, and he's the expert on which presidents care about black people.
thats not the main problem about flint though. the biggest thing is that they tried to switch water sources without tellin anyone and without proper inspections and then they noticed how bad it was months after the switch and then finally came out about it. also the water is 19 times more corrosive than detroits, thats far more than then the average "dont drink because of lead" type tap water.
trump has said he wants to do that. idk if he said specifically anything about dod dollars. but he's big on infrastructure overhaul/improvement. i'm hopeful that he follows through on that stuff. one of the few legitimate applications of government, imo. for the record, i didn't vote for trump. since that will be the kneejerk critique i will get.
*rio 2016! come for the olympics, stay for the hospitals!*
i swear that russia got caught doping on purpose so they didn't have to send their athletes to rio.
op if that is truly you;would it be alright if i put this on a shirt for myself? probably not even going to do it and definitely not going to try and sell it...way too lazy.
i am so excited/worried to watch what a disaster these olympics will become.
brazilliant logo. i bet it goes ***viral***. *** *** the number 3.14... in mathematics is a pi-o-hazard. use tau.
does anyone else think that the summer olympics should simply always be done in greece? it would make historical sense, it's a nice country, and they could really use the tourism. the winter olympics should probably always be done in the swiss alps.
i feel bad for the parasailing teams. i read that 3 teaspoons of the water they're going to compete in is enough to get a virus. the thing is, they use their mouthes to bite down rope that'll be wet when their hands are full. there's no way they won't get sick. same thing for those that have to swim in that water.
negative comments regarding a country usually get rebutted on reddit. could it be the brazil/rio is really that awful?
before this post had like 12 000 upvotes but nowit only has 8500. what happened?
...and guess what? the games went fine, one of the best opening ceremonies in a while and everyone enjoyed themselves. biggest controversy was a group of american athletes acting like morons and lying to try and get out of it. guess the brazil-hate circlejerk was pretty unwarranted after all.
this post has been rapidly downvoted in the last few hours. only a few hours ago it had reached over 15k, now down to 8300ish. can't help thinking that this isnt deliberate. olympic committee doing some pr work maybe?
goddamn penguins making me have restart plague inc/pandemic
i play plague inc, and it's usually greenland or some small country. what's this game that you're referencing?
you and op better be comfortable seeing this get stolen by buzzfeed in about 12 hours.
i wish i could understand how they convinced the officials that they deserve the olympics. are the olympic officials trying to bankrupt shitty, oblivious countries on purpose now? conspiracy?
go for it. i thought about doing it with zazzle or something but those guys would probably take it down for copyright infringement or something. then again, i am also lazy.
isis won't bother attacking because they'd be too terrified to go to rio
since i was a kid they've said every olympics was going to be a disaster. i come from sydney and the disaster that was apparently unfolding with the sydney olympics was a big let down as the games ran not only smoothly, but were apparently "the best games ever". before beijing, people where going to die from smog inhalation. sadly not many suffered. sochi was supposed to be a remake of the 1936 berlin olympics. yet no race of super human russians stepped up to the plate to bring a world war. i've become bitter and skeptical in my old age that every olympic games is going to run smoothly. until rio. rio has brought back hope.
prepare to be disappointed by 99% of the events running perfectly fine and a great opening and closing ceremony except one hiccup like a ring that doesn't light up
this needs more upvotes. weapons grade wordplay is why i come to reddit most days
if they can manage it... if you've seen the photos, it is a shame how greece has let the 2004 athens olympics site go to a complete ruin a mere decade after the games happened. it's hard to imagine you could let brand new buildings rot so fast. and this was during a period where they were receiving significant eu subsidies. maybe the olympics should be held in greece, but managed by germans or something. i don't have much confidence in the ioc's decision making wisdom.
no, i don't think the onus should be on one country. i think there should be designated cities who have already hosted that are on a rotating roster to hold the games. there would be an official process to appoint these cities. for example one from each continent at least. same for winter olympics. that way we can minimise the stress of picking a city and having that country go bankrupt trying to build the infrastructure. and upcoming athletes can be assured they're going some place that knows what's it's doing. i'm not saying this is a perfect solution but i think it's a decent one.
i see that you also have hbo and watched real sports with bryant gumbel.
there is no reason to defend brazil. they failed their people and the world in a pretty clear cut, objective way.
idk if over ever seen such an upvoted post, at around 14,000 now!
pandemic 2 i think, free online game. it was a major thing some years ago. reddit went crazy with the madagascar thing. the goal was to infect the world and madagascar was really hard to get. it became a meme... the president of madagascar one is pretty good. shut. down. everything.
i'm cool with it. i figure that must mean i'm talented or something.
yep then the athletes carry the virus back to their home countries, causing simultaneous worldwide outbreaks.
at this point i think the umbrella corporation could do a much better job.
you took a competitive swim. you have dysentery. you have died of dysentery.
rio 2016! come for the olympics, stay because your passport was stolen!
how the hell are you going to run if you are shitting yourself and dying of dehydration?
any chance you can make one that says bio 2016? same script...?
or maybe they'd intentionally get infected, then spread it around the world as quickly as possible.
you're bitter that an olympics *hasn't* been a disaster? aw, who am i kidding, me too. i've never been this excited for a literal shit show.
man, there have already been reports of the olympic village being unsanitary and broken. even if the events go fine, what about the actual tourists?
roses are red it's all the rage i have an infection bacteriophage
i've always assumed that plague inc. was made by the same folks. if it wasn't, it's at least a spiritual successor.
for real: watermark that shit or something. bask in all the glory op!!!
super athlete boss fights. one from each event. so many ideas you can draw from
umbrella at the very least did well keeping their scummy shit contained. it's only because of some opera singing fuck that the t-virus got free.
rio 2016! come for the olympics, stay because your life was stolen!
wait.. isnt a side effect of zika the whole tiny headed baby thing? maybe they should do that.
there's *always* complains about the olympic village
drinking three teaspoons summer river's battle splash golden corpse showers
haha that's a nice way of saying blatant rip-off. i think it was made by the same people though.
meh. i figured a watermark would detract from the image. if people wanna use it i don't care that much. the process of creating it was so simple someone with a few minutes and photoshop could recreate it.
yeah, but that plan only works if they can get laid.
is it hours wasted if you love playing a great game?
thank you. it always felt weird seeing people pay for a game that was done just as well online for free.
it's not the process of creating it that you're claiming necessarily, as much as having the unique concept. plenty of highly simplistic art that technically, anyone could make, is still impressive based on the concept the artist had alone. take pride in your work. saying you created it by no means takes away from the value or impact of the piece itself.
i think reddit should create a campaign to stop the rio olympics and use this as it's logo.
in other news, goats mysteriously born with tiny heads all across the middle east.
hey man, no shame in promoting a product you like.
not at all, i would just hate to see someone getting (shadow)banned for such an innocent comment.
number three will make you rip your own eyeballs out!
finally, leo is free of having to choose interesting, challenging roles. he can pull a reverse mcconaughey, and spend the rest of his career making b-grade action flicks and shitty rom-coms.
maybe the quickest rising self post i've ever seen
wanted him to just stand up and say "about fucking time" and walk off
guys, serious for a minute. is anyone seeing leo only talking on his left side?
"climate change is real. it is happening right now." leo finally gets an oscar, and what does he do? use it to preach a serious cause. good on him.
i love that he took the opportunity to remind people to "not take the planet for granted". thanks for posting link.
he could've filibustered the show and he wouldn't get played out.
that is the face of a man who didn't even dare to truly hope because he'd been crushed that many times.
it beat out a few hundred others by just a few seconds.
they weren't about to play that hurry-up music on old leo and he knew it.
after cutting his hand on a crushed wine glass, of course.
by far one of the most amazing things i've seen today. leo winning an oscar is tops though
this post will make it to the top of all time of the subreddit. calling it now.
leo oscar is on the decline. gaben's "he's an ass." and "you're fired." memes are on the rise! invest! invest!
it would have been both hilarious and sad if ashton kutcher jumped out from behind the curtain.
daniel day-lewis reminds me of this old japanese gentlemen who used to show up at our community swimming pool once in a blue moon, awe everyone in attendance with his incredible butterfly stroke for like 3 minutes, then disappear again. we used to speculate on whether he was even real or a mass hallucination.
go post that in sandersforpresident. guaranteed front page
i haven't seen revenant yet so i can't really make a complaint, but i was really hoping he'd get it this year. sicario was a top notch addition to an incredible career.
now i can sleep in peace. finally. after all these years.
i honestly really liked his speech, it was well said.
their movies the merchant and the repentant were truly ground breaking films. i am sorry. it was on the card.
and now op is getting showered in upvotes and gold.
i don't know if he went longer than others who got the music, but yeah i was wondering if like, someone came in through the headset to the music team like "just let it slide this guy can take as long as he needs".
nah, if that happened he'd probably keep the acceptance speech going.
what's eating gilbert grape? the aviator blood diamond wolf of wall street the revenant
the cinematography was probably the best thing about the revenant (and that's not a jab at the acting/plot).
ive got six acceptance speeches written! i got all night.
"huh, why is nguyen pronounced 'win'? that's such a strange last name you know. speaking of strange names, i met this dude in a tokyo club last week named itchi. i mean, who the hell calls their son "itchy"? "
in front of a mirror with a shampoo bottle as the oscar
i would not be here today if it were not for the amazing efforts of leonardo dicaprio. praise be.
he definitely went longer. it would look awful to play him off.
did you know he really cut his hand during the filming of that scene, and then kept going? i bet you didn't. it is a little known fact here on the inter-nets.
still can't believe he didn't win for grape. unbelievable acting.
i'm surprised to not see the depahted. he was amazing in that movie.
the post made to to the top of reddit in 3 minutes. it's a new record.
oh great so he's paid by hollywood now? clinton is going to use that clip against him.
those were all movies for which he was nominated, so no the departed. if, however, you were expressing surprise that he hadn't been nominated for the departed: i'm with you on that one.
it's gotten 1000 upvotes a minute - that's pretty fucking crazy
it was the same year as blood diamond. they gave him that nom instead. which i think i agree with.
60k now (not actually but i need karma too guys)
copy please, this contract is legally binding. if you don't give it to all of us, /r/legaladvice will become a busy place.
if he follows through is it still a shitpost??? still upvoted.
i up voted. sounds too good to be true. no risk no reward
if you actually do this you won't be rich anymore lol
/u/violent_poop /u/awall621 /u/hiphopdad get in here for free stuff
what if he counters by saying its not exactly 100? ;-;
op got more than 100 upvotes. we failed once we gave the 101st. and don't bother the new folks to downvote to get back to 100: more than 100 upvotes with balancing downvotes is still more than 100 upvotes. (now if you get upvoters to change their vote, then you have a game.)
just a quick lesson on contract law for everyone wanting to make their own contracts (also i am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice): for a contract to be binding (in most cases, and for easiest setup purposes - i'm sure people can explain alternatives and exceptions), you have to have offer, acceptance, and consideration. if you want to bind your friends, foes, and random other people to their promises, make sure you're each promising each other something, and it can't be nominal (for example, in many cases $1 is not considered to be valid consideration, even though courts tend not to inquire as to the sufficiency of consideration - just its validity). op made an offer that can only be accepted by performance, and, technically, because we all upvoted, we accepted. however, the consideration might be deemed nominal and thus unenforceable, if you did go to court over it.
it's gonna cost him a lot of money for sun and moon.
i know, right? *frantically upvotes and leaves comments*
juuuust in case... but i already know i'm in for a disappointment
oh no you're totally right... we're about to get a picture of two celestial bodies and look like fools
i mean, sun & moon is a great above & beyond album.
i'm 99.99999% sure you're correct, but i'm upvoting and commenting on that 1 in 10,000,000 chance that i'm wrong.
if he don't, i'll down vote every post he makes or has made for a few months because i'm poor and petty
eh he/she is only at $352k at the moment. that's pocket change to some! not me though ;-;
yeah, think of all the things you can do with your own sun!
better deliver lad. else i'll take this to /r/karmacourt.
if this gets more upvotes than zrmaster, i'll post the first result for pokemon snap on google images.
until op delivers, it is both a shitpost and not a shitpost at the same time. schrodinger's shit.
i'm waiting for my call to appear on "when shitposts go too far".
even if the final price is around $2 million there are surprisingly many people who could pull it off.
/u/emobatmanreturns /u/elune /u/aryanshiro get in here for free stuff
you are looking at it wrong. he did, in fact, get 100 upvotes. regardless of how many more there are, he got 100.
there is positively no chance that any court would take this to be a legally binding offer. i'm willing to bet somebody's actually going to post about this in /r/legaladvice though.
maybe just one copy for everyone to share. i'll take saturdays and alternating wednesdays
i swear that if op delivers, i'll eat a whole pizza.
i'll join you on the operation. we must band together to punish him.
that amount of money, hell even a tenth of it, would change my life forever, and pretty much solve every problem in my life right now.
on my way */u/a_favorite_rug /u/amagrilbtw /u/ninetofivehero* get the limo ready
no, i think he'd just have to sell you a copy of sun and moon then.
the wording matters, it doesn't say "least" or "more". it represent an exact number.
i bought 3 copies of sun and moon. did i do it right?
i also would like one disappointment please and sun as well
actually liking it would take way less effort than photoshopping a fake upvote
but at one point in time...he did "get 100 upvotes".
how can someone like not buy 17.000 copies of two games and give them to us ??
i would like one moon disappointment! (gotta rep the night!)
correct: whether he got 18,000 or 134, he first must get 100 up votes. it's on him to clarify the 'exactly' clause.
you'd be surprise how hard it is to find an outer space table.
i'm genuinely curious, has anyone approached you and asked you to sign their ass since you first made that post? ...also, can you sign my ass?
how many butt cracks can we expect to see on the front page in 2016?
my sister is getting marred today and this post is bigger news
i bet if we moved the camera to behind you, we'd see a butt crack.
hmu on instagram: @biblicalfigure also i'll be playing the midnight at saturday prerelease at hobby central in delaware, oh if anyone wants to come thru and get whooped. or whoop me. it could go either way but in any case y'all are my dawgs.
i don't partake in mtg but i would like to know if your original post has made an impression. have belts become more of an essential part of the game?
why would you be banned for that. he's like a martyr, raising awareness for exposed butt cracks everywhere
what, his pulitzer-worthy piece on the ritual crack-flashing of magic subculture had him banned?! what happened to liberty of press?!
i won't lie to you you're my hero and got me to play magic i saw your post on reddit and i also had a few packs of journey to nyx from my local shop. you saved me from depression. you are a god amongst players.
it seems like someone who's been banned from tournaments ever since the incident happened is the *last* person who'd know the answer to that question though.
the statement from wotc (the governing body) was something along the lines of 'we accept all body types'. they also recently banned a rapist who was released and completely rehabilitated a decade ago, purely because he got too much spotlight from the professional scene.
i'm about this guys size, and i'm shocked that table didn't buckle in like 2 seconds!
damn maybe one day i'll learn to not open every res picture without reading.
that's really a pretty nice butt. it may not be campus streaker meets blm protesters nice, but for guy butts it's at least an 8/10.
this guy just gets to touch butts for the rest of his life. he's got it made.
is shimakaze's skirt really so shor- oh wow it actually is.....
ostrasizing a large *large* part of the community, it didn't sit well with wotc. not saying i agree with the ban but it's not hard to see where they were coming from.
the people who give you money to go to your tournament typically don't want to have their ass photographed and put on the internet without their knowledge. i know what you're going to say: then they shouldn't have their ass hanging out. that's a stellar response, but the tournament still doesn't want their players photographed and put on the internet without their knowledge.
and how come he only has about 4800 link karma (as i am writing it) when his ass crack post got 38k upvotes?
i don't see the rice guy posting pictures.. seems he was just bullshitting 24/7. what a fucking lame top post for reddit.
i'll never understand why that montage parody post was so highly upvoted.
that rice one was stupid af, but i guess it got a few laughs from people.
he got banned for taking some pictures of ass cracks??
i'm glad i could help, my friend. if you ever want someone to talk to our whatever, give me a shout.
yeah especially on reddit. no engineers on here. none at all.
yeah for 18 months, wizards wanted to make sure their customers felt safe to be disgusting in public.
you just made me zoom in on an illustrated woman's asscrack. well done.
... you are sitting at home in the dark basement of your house, the glare from your computer screen leaves your face visible only, illuminating the doritos crumbs hanging from the ends of your beard, mountain dew in one hand, mouse in the other, throbbing boner down below, soon the boner will replace the mountain dew, scrolling through milf hunter skat gargglers, there it is, the video you have been looking for, it's your mother, she got that skat in her eye, you check the view count, ohfuckyesmom, she has cracked the 7 digits, you toss the mountain dew aside, it's contents get finished on the floor, while your contents get finished on your gut, you stroke the crumbs from your beard and mix it in to the steaming pile of kids on your stomach, you pull out a clean canvas, stroke that orange jizz to create a new masterpiece, place it the next day in the art auction in manhatten, get bid up to 3.7mill. this is how you know you have made it big.
it's big news because his original post was funny as hell.
"so, ah, are we just not gonna talk about the grand prix smell...?"
nothing like bringing your kid to a tournament and having them exposed to large smelly mens asscracks (16 of them no less) and then if you do anything about it or say anything about it you get banned for harassing those men.
if photos weren't permitted, the event would have said so. he got banned for bullying/belittling/humiliating people, which makes sense. a magic event is supposed to be a "safe space" for players (even if they don't call it that), so i can see why wizards would take this buttcrack expose so seriously. i both greatly appreciate his contribution to the world of found art, and understand why he would get banned from continuing to hone his craft.
he was, but no more for he has risen from the asshes.
is it any different than taking similar pictures of women's cleavage?
yes i will. i'm debating on driving 7 hours just to play the pre release with you. you're a legend keep being you. thank you for the encouraging words.
haha. he's not the only one. it actually got me to head down to my local shop and check out the scene and get back into the game after 12 years.
that's just weird. what he did was hilarious. fucking wotc needs to develop a sense of humor.
it's the all time top post of r/funny. almost 10,000 more upvotes than the second highest post. it's just too perfect
i just bring a box of boosters and open one whenever it gets to me.
i'm really wondering how everyone would react if it was a sequence of attractive female asscracks.
jeeze. heavy on the white there. that's gonna be nearly impossible to run in any multicolor deck.
wow, sounds like the people in charge of those tourneys have no sense of humor
nope, and to be honest if you could find that much cleavage at an mtg tournament, and took pictures of it every time, and posted it on the internet and got internet fame for it, you'd probably also get a ban from wizards.
to be fair to wizards a bunch of butt-hurt mtger's kicked up a shitstorm on social media over the post. if i cared enough i'd have just gone to the next local tourney and called in a bunch of public indecency complaints to the police but i honestly can't be arsed to put the effort in.
i always love it when i see /u/orbojunglist's gifs in the wild. the guy deserves so much credit.
its the top post of all time because of reddits weird way of counting votes. it got most of its votes nearly two days later because of the shitstorm, and reddit trims votes (no joke look it up or follow a rising post), but when the usual amount of votes come in late it bypasses the trim altogether.
i've been clean for years (of magic, i'm hygienic in general), and i swear i could smell the freshly-opened booster pack just now.
i could just imagine the scenario. "shit i cant get this fucking card on the field. how am i supposed to propose if she keeps wrecking my shit"
i thought it was hilarious and fun natured. that said, i can see why they wouldn't want someone taking pictures of the participants with the sole objective of making fun of them. a lot of the people that go to these events aren't social butterflies and you want them to feel welcome without people making fun of their appearance.
that was the very gif that got me to sign up to imgur, which inevitably led to reddit ;)
i'm curious about what will happen with the votes in this thread. reddit's usual what-ever-the-fuck-they-do to the votes hasn't kicked yet since this an hour old post at 10,000+ upvotes.
i thought that /r/montageparodies had the number 1 post of all time?
hoooooly mother of fuck i want one. i neeeeed one.
go on. buy a pack. nobody gets hooked after just one.
what made you decide to give up magic? (retired competitive yugioh player here)
this is the only real answer. i'm fat, but not nearly as big as the dudes in question. the only way i can 100% guarantee no sag is suspenders. i've discovered that as unfashionable as suspenders are, when running a chainsaw, best to have both hands available. having to pull up ones pants every third step makes that impossible.
at the same time every venue needs standards. for example, i recall walking by a gaming store that had to put a notice/psa in the front window about basic hygiene, because i guess the regulars were that bad about it. i cant imagine how bad, because im sure just having the notice up would scare away some customers...but maybe the smell was worse. idk what exactly event organizers should do about excessive ass crack, but they could probably consult an hr person to get an answer.
you know bfz, the upcoming set, is reintroducing *full art lands* right? and they're guaranteed in booster packs, or a pack of ~~100~~ 80 inside a fat pack. you always *talked* about pimping your special deck with full-art zendikar lands, right? well now's the perfect chance to do it.
my guess is because it costs a fuck ton of money like any tgc and consumes your life if you get really into it. it's like a drug, hence the "clean for years"
suspenders can actually be fashionable. in more of a hipster way with a button up or something... but still. almost anything can be fashionable if you wear it well. fuck the haters
i worked at a comic store for. a year and a half. we had deodorant in the bathroom (spray) and no it did not solve the problem. our back is super packed on fridays for magic and i would avoid it because it smelled like fast food and bo. and i've had customers who were so bad and smelled like literal shit that we would open all the doors and have purge the area with spray afterwards.
there's plenty of butts on the internet. his face made it funny. like a comedian with good delivery telling a knock knock joke.
fuck you i've been clean for 6 months.... i just pulled out my legacy deck and looked at its filthy regular land...
great work on making snapchat's facial filters relevant again!
is no one finding this odd... snap ends up front page a few days after ipo...hard to believe this wasn't fabricated
in less than half a day, this post has over half the karma of barack obama's ama, the most upvoted post on reddit of all time. congratu-fucking-lations, op.
i wonder where the cutoff is, for people who are young enough to not feel like they are in the future.
it's actually the restaurant mythos. poseidon's fury is across the walkway (and is awesome, btw)
i still don't know how she can get wasted, she turn all the liquids she touch into water, maybe it's only her hands...
it does seem like everyone just rolls with it... but what can we do else? we can't just stop the future from futuring.
the cutoff point is when you realize the 90s weren't 10 years ago.
when the technology appears after you're 40, it's evil. when it appears when you're 30-40, it's interesting but not for you. when it appears whenever you're 20-30, it's amazing and the future, and if it appears when you're under 20, it's a normal part of life and nothing special.
that is really freaky you said that. i'm rewatching that whole gamegrumps series.
you haven given me several free compliments before, so here's one from me. you provide a glimpse of happiness to people every day. you should feel proud of yourself for that in this crazy, crazy world that we all inhabit. even though i have never met you, i feel honored just having you respond to my mostly ridiculous, pun filled comments. (although i do try to make people laugh. :) ) your family must be very proud of you. i know i would be proud to call you family. continue your good work kind stranger.
hey dude im feeling down in the dumps. can you do me next?
thanks for doing what you do! if it's not to much trouble, may i be next?
it's also at islands of adventure, not universal studios.
coming from a californian, i want to visit florida's amusement parks so badly. disneyland / disneyland california & hollywood studios are just so lackluster in comparison to florida's. i know, they are both awesome (have a socal pass to disneyland) but i have envied florida since i was about 10
the original version of poseidon's fury was way better than the craptastically-disjointed steaming pile they have in there nowadays.
this will be gone to make room for nintendoland soon, no?
i started reading this paragraph and thought this was gonna be another one of /u/shittymorph's "through an announcer's table" references
i think it's the mythos restaurant in orlando fl, universal studio
i'm roughly 30, lol, and i have felt like technology was evil for at least the last 4 years.
good episodes but gawd, danny is ass at those games.
for anyone wondering, it's called tap my katamari and it's absolute garbage. it's just an idle clicker game. you don't get to roll a katamari around, picking up random stuff and getting bigger. you just tap, collect points, and then spend those points on upgrades that tap for you.
i didn't know there was one, and now i do, and i want to do that. this is your fault.
i hope you and everyone reading this exchange has a great day. :)
generally when people refer to universal orlando they're referring the whole resort - universal studios florida is one park and islands is the other
or, more to my own taste, the older and wiser /r/freecompliments! of course, i may be biased since i created it
you are correct. although it's on the islands of adventure side and not the actual universal studios side. but it's all under the universal umbrella.
"knock, knock" "who's there?" "9/11" "9/11 who?" "i thought you said you'd never forget!?!"
listen to this: we are closer to the ice ages than 9/11 was to the dinosaurs. put that in your pipe and smoke it.
it's good for background noise for when i'm trying to finish work.
there used to be a game that you'd tilt your phone to aim as you'd roll the ball around, but it was pretty tough so i didn't play it very much. point is, it was at least katamari experience-esque. this new tap tap game is just useless.
at first i think thought /u/jrodicus meant for psp. your comment made me check the app store. this is your fault.
read it on the internet, can also confirm all of this.
universal/ioa annual passholder. currently orlando resident. can also confirm.
student at university of central florida. got kicked out of all universal affiliated parks for a year. can also confirm.
this is the second day in a row our hometown has risen to the top of /r/all without it being a shooting or a florida mantm story. neat!
instructions unclear. parked outside adventure islands. please advise
when you are old enough to remember when part time jobs existed
dont be, youll literally be one in what feels like the blink of an eye. ill be 30 in one year... i had my first daughter at 22 and the time since then has flown so quickly i cant even believe it.
you still got them sailor legs to hop on, ol' timer? if you do, then i'll tell you that all of your prior comments come across quite polite! as easy as it is to be rude online, you've pulled through without doing so - good on you. :)
you've had this account for over a year and made only several comments and posts! i always appreciate a man of few words. :)
lucky. if i could live there i'd pack up and move in a heartbeat. "there" being in universal itself.
i am pretty sure everyone is wondering why you got kicked out!
nah you can't, the parking areas are all by the front of citywalk
but that's why hahah time goes faster the closer i get to 30 and the existential crises don't seem to slow down either
there actually *was* a shoddy 3d official version where you rolled everything up. but it was so buggy and eventually left behind. i think it might have been the iphone4 or 5 days. now the relatively new one is a bad excuse for a *clicker* genre game. it's horrible.
you're a wonderful novelty account - accidentally stumbled on you in this thread and it's been a fun perusal of your history.
as fucking nerdy as it sounds, the wizarding world of harry potter in universal/ioa is one of the reasons i moved to orlando.
you might say these jokes are just plane wrong. holyshitpunsforlife
haha. the edit was under 2 minutes. i didn't realize it wouldn't show up as editing.
thank you! my more recent comments haven't contained nearly as many compliments - i've broken the mold of my username frequently. that said, i've been at it for, apparently, over 4 years - what a ride.
it's one of the reasons my wife and i want to move there. also, the mummy.
please tell me you are a mod at /r/wholesomememes. you are a national treasure and we need more people like you to be the change they want to see in the world.
"tell me, master. do you follow the light side or the dark side?" "i am ... ***undecided.***"
ken what do you intend to do after the election? use your fame for good or evil, or try to lay low?
i like how you're still wearing your iconic red sweater.
when i clicked the link, i had my hand on my dick, when i saw who it was, i kept it there.
i feel like i'm witnessing history being made. in 50 years i will proudly tell my grandchildren about the time i upvoted obiwan kenboni
hi ken bone. i think you are a cool guy. my coworker named chase thinks you are really cool too. can you say "hi chase, i'm ken bone and i think you are a nice fellow." it'll surely make his day that you said hi, he thinks of you as a hero. plus, nobody loves chase, not even jesus. the little guy could use a confidence boost. you are simply adorable.
would you mind if i voted for you on election day?
at this point, i wouldn't be surprised if someone already dressed up as ken bone as obiwan kenboni..
ken. if we could petition you to be an admin would you accept?
you have reached a reddit elite status. any time you pop up it's like pure magic
wait is this the real ken bone? why is your username stan gibson? am i in the bone zone right now?
gee ken sure is a bold move posting without a throwaway maybe tomorrow we can run a story about how secretly bad of a jedi obi-wan kenboni is just kidding man. random dude here who doesn't comment much just taking the opportunity to tell you you're a cool ass guy. a lot of people hope to be as respectable of a guy as you are someday.
if there was an award for best redditor of the year, it would go to you good sir
why do you prefer the zip up sweater to the crew neck? winter is quickly approaching and i need to buy clothing asap.
i bet it sucks having to wear a red polo every day now.
i often look in the mirror and imagine myself wearing someone else's underwear, usually a celebrity or famous public figure. historical or present day. i try to imagine what they would wear. what type of person they are. would they wear cotton, acrylic, bamboo, latex, microfiber, nylon, polyester, silk, spandex. i wonder the colors, red, blue, torquoise, tortoise, white. boxer, brief, boxer-briefs, thong, commando? i dive into the persona of the person and strut around my bathroom, pretending to live their underwear life for a brief moment. today, i'm going to choose you mr. bone. i'm going to imagine myself in the underwear you would wear. i'm thinking something red, 60% polyester, 40% cotton. you're a simple man. briefs. it feels good. you feel good. i like this one.
hey ken, i was at a frisbee tournament this weekend and there was an entire team of people dressed as you at the party. it was amazing
i'll still be doing what i do now, only nobody will be paying attention by then. i'm surprised they are now.
i upvoted the post and then downvoted it just so i could get the satisfaction of upvoting it again
and then they'll ask you what the fuck any of that means.
that picture is haunting. you simultaneously look 12 years old and a pedophile.
at least one person lives chase. i love chase. my wife is right here, she thinks he's ok too. no strong feelings either way.
as long as it gets you to the polls to vote on the other issues on your ballot.
at least one person did, they posted it yesterday.
i'm already a lazy mod in a few subs. that's enough responsibility to ignore for one man.
he could be using samuel l. jackson's lightsa-... ...oh. then, no. no he cannot.
user name was for stan musial bob gibson mike shannon number 18 great st louis cardinals
it does look pretty purple in the picture. in person it's the bright blue of luke's first saber.
ease of use and versatility. it's easy to pull on, and the zipper lets you customize the amount of shirt you want to show allowing it to be used with button downs, polos, or basic under shirts.
worse than that, it's a sweater. it was quite warm today too.
sweet! hey, my wife is going into a big important job interview tomorrow and it would mean a lot to her if you wished her good luck. it's her dream job working at the forest preserve and she is super nervous. sorry for the strange request. great costume by the way! e: thanks again. she snagged the second interview!
you could have just un-upvoted, then upvoted again. not saying your way is wrong, just saying there's a way to do it without downvoting america's savior ken bone.
"no strong feelings either way"... in true ken bone fashion, he's decidedly meh about almost everything. god this man is a miracle.
ken bone is the guy who acknowledges the originality of people who are literally pretending to be him.
hate to disappoint you, but it's actually luke's bright blue one.
probably a lack of a uv filter on your camera and/or crappy automatic adjustments to levels and color correction. that particular shade of purple usually indicates the former, but the way the tv is washed out would suggest the light level was pretty low (probably to get a better glow effect from the saber itself i assume) which means it could also be the latter.
as a cultural catholic, that is *such* a catholic thing to say
would that technically be the same as a neutral sith or gray sith? or is it more like a partly sunny versus partly cloudy thing? kind of funny thinking about gray jedi and gray sith being and to sit next to each other in a bar and talking about the broader goings on of those who have chosen sides.
how the fuck did that line get said in front of dozens of ppl and no one say: hey there's much much better ways of getting this message across from anakin without him sounding like some total douche. no one when explaining their motivations against a group has ever said "from my point of view the other guys are evil!" also it made no fuckinng sense for his character. the jedi hadn't betrayed him; just sidious made him an offer to save padme.. he has no reason at all to make this statement. his motivations for opposing the jedi are fine- he was in love and wanted to save her at any cost, something most people can sympathize with. a lot of us would do fucked up shit to save people we love... but this dumb fucking line threw all that out the window
sorry. "soon." i can live without the sweater, but i can't replace the boy.
this just in: ken bone is involved in child trafficking and knock-off garments. how did america fall for his lies?
i'm sure she's gonna be great. the forest service will be lucky to have her, just like you are.
"the term gray jedi, or gray, had two meanings. first, it was used by jedi and sith to describe force-users who walked the line between the light and dark sides of the force without surrendering to the dark side, and second, it described jedi who distanced themselves from the jedi high council and operated outside the strictures of the jedi code. however, those who were considered to be true gray jedi met both qualifications and did not belong to any particular force tradition." so basically, not good, not bad and doing your own thing. pretty much chaotic or true neutral dnd alignment
"i saw him.. *puts finger to lips and soap opera - caliber dramatic pause* killing younglings!"
every one talks about the sand line but for me this was way worse. it honestly sounds like a placeholder line until they could write real dialogue: "anakin says some shit about how from his point of view the jedi are evil"
hell, it still would have been better even if he said the extremely simple line "the jedi are evil!".
with enough ken bonin', i'm sure you could make another
you know, i didn't get it until just now. i thought it was just another dumb meme for bandwagoning. but you, you're just a regular goddamn person aren''t you? and that's not gonna change no matter what happens in the world. thank you for reminding me ken.
holy hell, can you be anymore perfect? are you single? ;)
should have seen it coming... we are in the bone zone after all.
jedi loners, then. that's actually kind of bad ass. i'm assuming the sith (proper) still considered them enemies and wouldn't spare them in a purge. sith got no chill.
lucas is a fantastic *idea guy*. everybody has always said he's a shit writer, especially of dialogue. the original trilogy was heavily rewritten by his wife and other people. and often the dialogue had some adlib components.
someone on imdb had a stab at the finished product... *"the jedi took me from my mother, and left her to die! they used me my entire life and still never trusted me! and you obi wan, you turned my wife against me! chancellor palpatine was the only person who ever cared about me, and you have the nerve to lecture me about evil?"* nah. instead of that, let's make the most powerful force user in the history of the galaxy - a guy who was apparently *conceived by the force itself*, who would realign the very structure of the force.... and make him a whiny little bitch.
he's had a vasectomy. a bit more difficult to reverse.
actually he isn't just a regular guy, he is better than the average memer. he is the king of memes. if the lion king was memes he would be simba.
they would also sometimes have different coloured blades, orange, yellow etc. (instead of green/blue vs red etc)
i don't know why people act like if the dialogue in the original trilogy is a master piece. i mean... it's not. it's clearly not.
it makes me uncomfortable that this is common knowledge
that sub is just the same stupid kenm memes re-hashed over and over. i absolutely love it.
in his ama he said "stan gibson is for stan musial and bob gibson."
nah, he asked for purple and they gave it to him because he was special.
the real question is how many nudes did this get you
aww yeah! nothing gets a girl goin like an artificial sled simulation...
i forgot about this game boutta go waste my life again
this is all i did in typing/keyboarding class in 8th grade. monday, do all assignments for two weeks. normally done in a half hour. then, two weeks of line rider.
i miss the old simpler days of line rider, when i didn't do all of my line riding through my nose.
none :( i spent like 8 entire minutes making this too.
wouldn't an artificial sled simulation just be an actual sledding?
i'm willing to bet it's not as enticing as you remember.
same here. runescape made typing easy eventually. my teacher said i was going to be a well paid secretary.
man those were the days, eh? having to sneak out during lunchtime (it sucked when they were serving the round red baron pizzas, but what can you do?), head behind the school, score some white magic, adrenaline pumping, then head to the bathroom and use a suppository to get that ever elusive ecstasy. ahhh, middle school memories always makes my butthole clench.
that took me longer than i'd care to admit to find the edit.
is this uncommon now? i find it shocking the amount of people who can't properly touch type but i'm older.
they didn't serve pizza at my school because it's unhealthy...
no way man those blocks just fell like that. haven't you heard of physics?
that would've meant he didn't delete his cookies for at least half a year.
me too. i thought it's some reddit inside joke i don't get.
yeah what? my school had the most disgusting pizza ever.
as a non american i am kind of shocked that routinely feeding kids pizza is considered normal in the first place. explains those obesity rates i suppose.
i've never checked, so i can't really answer that question.
you delete your cookies? still sharing a computer with your mom?
seems unfair -- for the amount of effort that he put in -- that you and /u/bradley_ get the same points when i upvote you both. life is strange.
i thought it was that guy that doesn't fix anything until i saw the username
it has been about 10 now and we all assume u/fuccinnerdbutt has called it quits.
runescape was my gateway to the english language. got an a(6 in norway)in english when i graduated high-school
we got dominoes and we also got that square pan shit pizza. it was $2 for the shit pizza, a side, and a milk. or if you were on free lunch you got dominoes and fries.
portion sizes and having an extremely diverse range of foods readily available in most decently sized metro areas. very easy to eat a lot, eat often, and eat a wide variety so it doesn't seem like you're eating all that much. if you don't know the glorious magic that is barbecue in the deep south then you won't understand.
any chance you were around in the beginning? i used to be a mod for linerider.org and iridethelines.com? it's been a long time since i've thought about the game/community.
i looked at my asshole in the mirror today. it blew my fuckin mind!
it just goes to show you don't always have to put the most effort in. just ride on someone's coattails that did
can someone ***please*** tell me whether this bradley dude is trolling/just practicing creative writing or if he actually lives the absolute saddest life of all time and is the most fucked up level of awkward humanly possible? bc he's either a legitimately great writer, or the most pitiful human ever to live.
wait what's that thing on reddit. oh the thing!! cmon guys, you know!? the thing, oh the fucking thing! like they put a random s or t somewhere!
wait, so the ones on free lunch got a better lunch as well?
my grandmother was a cafeteria lady and i loved going to visit her because she would always have whole sheet pans of that awesome rectangular pizza with the little pepperoni cubes for us to eat while we were there.
oh ya ive been around since early irtl days. my name was similar to this except had 2 additional names attached. acronym for me was ppt. what was yours?
i just realized that i've never actually seen my own asshole, which is actually kind of insane.
ellio's was nicknamed the project's pizza in my hometown. fuck it though i still loved it growing up
eh, they're okay i guess. if they're warm and fresh out of the oven they can taste pretty decent. honestly, i think the entire little ceasers menu can be classified as "tolerable if really hungry". not really good at all, and might give you burning shits, but it'll put something in your stomach. the crazy bread doesn't hold up to any other pizza places garlic bread for instance.
i got that, just how the fuck do you have the time and patience to do all this.
purplepurtleturtle or something like that? it sounds super familiar. lineridercrazy was mine, but i eventually changed it to lrc, lol. high school me was not good at naming things. another handle i had back then was shaunwhitefan.
sounded more like a business deal than flirtatious lol
i dunno what kind of dream land you're living in but that shit looks magical. the public school i went to served us sysco foods pizza. it came in a rectangular aluminum tray with a piece of foil on top. you got 4 pepperoni. 4. always. if you had a best best friend they might give you a pepperoni and you felt like a fucking king with your 5 pepperoni. ellios has like... shit loads of toppings and only half of them are made of cardboard or sawdust.
welcome to the internet, where small, silly things meet a level of dedication previously reserved for masterpieces of art. my bet is unemployment and autism.
ah yes lrc of course! wow crazy man. hope things have been going well for you
it is indeed. he'll send anyone nudes, all you have to do is pay me 3.50
kind of eye opening when you think that all the great artists during the renaissance and throughout history could have been autistic and probably were, but modern medicine had not yet discovered such mental illnesses.
the internet is cool. :) hope things are going well for you too!
as a permanent ceo? or are you guys temping it again?
friday afternoon, eh? someone took a pr class in college!
how did you find your job as ceo? i can't find anywhere to apply for as a ceo on indeed.com
1) is there any chance victoria will be returning? 2) what is happening with that 50 million dollars that was supposed to go back into the community? 3) do you feel that the influx of monetary influence has caused some of these, how shall we say, growing pains? 4) are you concerned about the sudden talk of alternatives to reddit, ie voat.co? 5) are you concerned about history repeating itself like digg.com? 6) what lessons did you learn from digg and how will you make different choices to avoid a mass exodus? 7) what's your favorite cat related content you've seen this week?
it sounds like pao served her role as the interim ceo perfectly. people were supposed to hate her so she could make changes the board of directors wanted that they knew some users would hate. then the white knight new ceo sweeps in to save the day and everyone is happy. they also promise to continuo pao's mission to make this a safe place so that should be fun.
hey steve, it's dacvak. we briefly met a long time ago when i first got hired. please let me know if you have any positions open for community manager, as i would love to return once i'm healthy enough to do so. :)
i'm so excited to have steve back with us. he helped build this platform that has been such a huge part of my life for the better part of a decade . . . i can't think of anyone better for the next decade
wasn't the default sub blackout due to mod's years of frustration with reddit admins? like years before pao joined on board? or are we just gonna pretend that pao didn't get a lot of misdirected hatred from the blackout
i have no strong feelings about this one way or another.
finally a mature decision. still, i have suspicions that it was all just a big plan to shift all the hate on ellen pao for making decisions which were coming "from the top".
for a long time a subreddit could declare any user a moderator, without that user having to accept it. pranks like that are why they added a system where the user has to accept the moderator position.
this is arguably the most important part. if there's a new ceo, but nothing's different...then what? what changed?
i not sure. i'm just starting to get to know everyone here and getting a lay of the land.
somewhere a college prof is nodding his head in silent approval
you're telling me. actually, everyone is telling me. the truth is it took a while to work everything out.
now we just need the steve back on blue's clues. steve-olution
1) no comment 2) no comment 3) no comment 4) no comment 5) no comment 6) no comment 7) saw a really cute picture of a kitten
0% chance this will get answered by the new ceo :|
like the beast rabban paving the way for feyd-rautha?
i think you deserve all the luck in the world, but the way you've done this *might* be perceived as putting him on the spot in public. you should maybe delete this comment and just pm or email the guy.
thank you! i really hope i live up to everyone's expectations. the good ones, at least.
of course that's what we're going to pretend. this is reddit.
the move to sf was before ellen's time. that was yishan's decision.
i guess no one bothered to find and delete inappropriate moderators retroactively. there's probably no good way to search for them?
i don't think we're going to get details anytime soon. a line like that is meant for the press, not for us.
for what it's worth, i truly feel that redditgifts has enriched my reddit experience and has engaged me far beyond typing words on a computer screen.
people are too busy drinking and fucking to care about the news
i know. welcome back. i hope your time away from reddit served you well. two things to remember: one, friday is ultimate werewolf day, and two, /r/subredditdrama is a fickle mistress. buena suerte :)
one of the first things my current dentist ever said to me was "wow, you are dressed like steve from blue's clues." i love that guy.
if recent times have left you blue, and cursing every line; or feeling pained and troubled too, to see the mood decline - *annoyed, provoked, and piqued with plight,* *at shifts and switches, strange -* *then let it pass. enjoy the site...* *and raise a glass to change!*
bro hipmunk is awesome. got my tickets to see the parents from there. did he make hipmunk?
appoint interim ceo to introduce unpopular changes until people are dangerously outraged, then have him/her step down for a more popular candidate and everyone is happy. meanwhile, old mistakes aren't fixed and old policy of gentrification continues. we'll see what happens but this would be right out of the corporate textbook.
i'm going to bed, if this carries on it would make a nice graph.
yep it's not like we've had years of problems now or anything. ellen just bought a time a machine a few months back and then she went back and fucked up that older stuff. that's how i remember it.
well, you can hardly be worse...right.....right guys??
after so much anger in the community. this gif just feels like a good sign.
thank you for that clarification. presumably the san francisco direction came from the board, not the ceo anyway. similar to my thoughts on respecting the knowledge/contributions of /u/chooter and /u/kickme444 on their area of specialty, i would hope the board would listen to people that they've hired. does /u/spez have the authority to make changes? the other thing i think about with the sf moves is that by forcing everyone to be together, reddit had to have an office space physically large enough to hold them all, as well as all the costs associated with that. whereas if i was living in new york and working for you out of my own apartment, you're paying me the agreed upon salary/benefits and not out any money to provide me with a desk, computer, power, toilet, etc.
by mentioning half-life 3 you have delayed it by 1 month. half-life 3 is now estimated for release in july 2604 ___ i am a bot, this action was performed automatically. if you have feedback please message /u/apium- or for more info go to /r/whenishl3
more like "i need to talk to more people before making that decision and don't want to have to eat my words later."
wow, didn't realize you got fired. so no more secret santa? :(
the best is when you get terms of service updates near midnight on a weekend.
uh, on reddit you need to hit enter again after the colon. like this: first priorities: * get to know the team here * make a clear content policy * ship some mod tool improvements
/u/shitty_watercolour *and* /u/poem_for_your_sprog? dear diary, today was a good day.
steve co-founded hipmunk after he left reddit. alexis drew the chipmunk.
i'm pretty sure a bunch of people in /r/conspiracy predicted this would happen as soon as the victoria thing happened.
and the award for most liberal definition of the word 'gentrification' goes to
or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
there was my risky click of the day, thanks /u/katie_pornhub
i am consistently amazed that it seems like pornhub has the best social media manager of any company. seriously, you've got this on lock.
so does half-life 3 get delayed by a month every time the bot mentions it? so everytime someone mentions it, it gets delayed by 2 months? thanks obama
i really doubt that they'd take that away.. secret santa was breaking records every year. it'd be extremely foolish of them to stop it, regardless of if /u/kickme444 comes back or not. that being said, i think /u/kickme444 should definitely be extended a return invitation. e: forgot a 4 in usernames
hmmm yea. time to drink twice as hard so i can forget about the fucking i'm not doing.
this comment is on par with /u/khalchris calling daniel radcliffe a 'filthy casual'.
maybe the first priority is to learn how reddit works.
actually, a clear content policy will alleviate a lot of the problems. i think pretty much everybody agreed that /r/fatpeoplehate, for example, wasn't a very constructive community. the problem was that other toxic communities were allowed to live, without a whole lot of rhyme or reason and even some accusations of admin favoritism in the case of /r/shitredditsays and a few others. a clear content policy is exactly what reddit needs. make it clear what is allowed and what is not, and ensure that everyone on reddit is subjected to the same rules. no more favoritism, and less overall toxicity.
i have a chrome extension that still shows then across all of reddit.
was just about to ask about that. are old warehouse subreddits being turned into vegan restaurant subreddits or something?
i love how i see her pop up sometime so casually like a regular redditor.
you want that verified? come by my place , i would love to have you over for dinner ;)
or to update this old ass markdown implementation.
i don't mean this to sound as judgmental as it probably does, but that's weird.
i'd pay to downvote someone extra hard. like the opposite of reddit gold.
need me to bring anything? maybe a wine or a side dish?
just a poem for my regular water? better than nothing i guess.
ah well i imagine she'd have put a nsfw tag if it was actually nsfw.. or maybe she wouldn't, since risky clicks are sort of okay at work for her?
if you have any children or a spouse it would be appreciated
i almost wish we could carve out a special part of copy right to appease disney and the like so everything else would revert. like an "actively used copyright protection" clause. like... if a copyright holder can show that a specific copyright is still being used for financial gain and the financial gain is not insignificant then they get to keep their copyright for another decade, with unlimited re-ups, so long as they can still show cause. that would probably piss off a shit load of people too. meh.
windows has been closed by dog.exe. "fetch" must be run before restart.
1. be a dog 2. do something /r/aww worthy 3. sell as lakefront property 4. profit
what breed is that? i've recently adopted a stray that looks similar
it's cute, but if that became a habit fuck would it be annoying.
with great willpower. you see, if you allow this, they keep doing it. then they'll start taking your xbox controller out of your hands during boss fights, or pushing your throttle to full while you're on a landing approach, and all you're doing is teaching them that it's ok to keep doing that.
i am so happy i have a cat that taught me how to play fetch. she woke me up in the middle of the afternoon (i work night shift) trilling by my ear and dropping a toy mouse by my face. she then starts tapping my face until i open my eyes. i see the toy mouse and pick it up; she follows the mouse with her eyes expectantly, so i decide to throw the mouse across the room. she chases it, and then brings it back, dropping it on my face (i am so glad it's a toy mouse); we repeat this several times, until she decides she's done.
breaking news: dog memes on the rise /r/memeeconomy
this is actually very, very true. give an inch and they will take a mile. this dog was very cute though.
smart! i like to acknowledge that my dogs are asking for attention, but not immediately give in. if one comes looking for a walk or play or needs breakfast suddenly, i look at them right in the face, pat or stroke them and say "ok, just be a minute!" then they know they have been seen and at a time soon of my choosing, i will give them what their hearts desire. dogs aren't dumb. they figure out tone and consistency better than kids sometimes.
this actually happens. a friend's dog when i was a kid would bite the nintendo controllers out of people's hands. annoying shit
exactly. it's cute the first time, and it's doubly cute if you see it on a gif on the internet, but if you have to live with that dog doing that to you every day, it would get annoying with a quickness.
a dog only lives for 15 years at most though. and you are their entire world. no matter what you do, the dog will be there for you. he will be your best friend and your greatest supporter. you could be the president or a homeless man, your dog would love you unconditionally all the same.
my dog plays this but then he also plays no throw only give. he will bring me his most beloved toy and put it in my hand. i'm an idiot so i think he wants to play. i throw it. he looks at me. he looks down the hall. he looks at me again, this time with disappointment somehow. he walks slowly down the hall. he retrieves hot dog. he looks at me again as if to say, "that was a gift, bitch," and goes to the other end of the couch.
this is awesome! what a funny little guy... my dog does something similar because he doesn't realize how plates and tables work. i'll be fixing dinner and drop something onto my plate, and he'll start looking around under the table for it thinking it's magically on the floor now. priceless.
lmao, i love it when pets see what's happening on tv. my mom's dogs freak out at animals.
my dog is a bit of a disappointment. she will pick up her favorite ball, run up to me, show it to me, jump up and down, bite down on the ball... and then not let me have the ball. if i somehow track her down and get a hold of it, she will go nuts until i throw it, go chase, and then resume teasing me with the ball. i get the impression she wants to play 'chase' more than 'fetch'.
i'll be honest, i was expecting that when your turned the lights on it wouldn't be a toy mouse.
i did this to my poor dog the other day. he brought his little fox toy over and dropped it on the couch beside me and started to climb up. thinking he wanted me to toss it i did...he looked at me like i had just ruined his life forever. he slowly got down from the couch grabbed his toy, walked way out and around me to hide it under his bed on the floor. then he laid down on top of it and stared at me like "i'll never trust you near my baby fox again you monster". whoops.
i don't have much choice. she follows me everywhere.
looks like the chest has a white spot. maybe a mix of some sort?
yeah, but you say that like it's a bad thing. if mine didn't insist on walks at a regular schedule, i would do nothing but sit and waste time on video games. he's the best personal trainer i know.
this is why i have dogs and no kids. plus its fun comparing your dogs to your friend's kids.
my dog regularly knocks my phone out of my hand with her paw.
and she'll still love me just the same if she waits for me to finish the goddamn level before we go play. :p
mine does all the time. i feel bad like i completely rejected his gift. he probably thought i was bored staring a flashing box on the wall and gave me something to do
yeah, i know. but they forgive us once we feed them, so all is good.
i never get bored of this one. it makes me smile every time
i know it's a joke, but too many owners don't get that toy tug-of-war is also a game.
my roommates dog does this. i don't think it's so much a mental disconnect as it is conditioning. the way that food falls on a plate over a table is the same or similar way that food can ricochet or drop and end up on the floor, which the dog has learned before and is looking out for now. so when they look on the floor to find food you dropped on your plate, i don't think they're surprised when they don't find anything, they're just disappointed that it wasn't a drop lucky enough to end up with food on the floor. dogs are just this desperate for our scraps.
get two balls, the dog will drop the ball they have cuz they want yours. easiest way to play fetch with dogs who dont like giving their balls back
this happened to my dog when we first rescued her. she had just been pregnant, and stupidly we bought her a toy puppy which she seemed to like. i kept throwing it for her, she would fetch it and hop up on the sofa and i'd throw it again, thinking we were playing a nice game of fetch. it turned out that she was nesting or whatever it is they do and she actually thought it was her puppy. we asked the vet for advice and they said to take it away until her hormones settled down. she was really sad for a day or so and i felt terrible :(
that is the classic labrador mixed with anything chest marking. i think you are right.
hey that was interesting! it also explains the behaviour of our in-laws dog which we keep for extended periods of time. she's a beautiful girl and i love her to pieces but she has some really annoying habits that she exhibits so much around her owners. at our house she rarely does them because i show disapproval. she continually paws up as if to shake a hand any time we stop on a walk, or happen to just be sitting. she nudges under elbows with her nose whenever an elbow is within her head range. only had to have my coffee spilled once to let her know that wasn't to happen again. you know, she completely understood my body language as i pulled my arm away and said firmly "stop it! we don't like that here." gave her a minute to digest that, patted her on the head and now it only happens occasionally when she forgets herself.
reminds me of the first time i tried teaching my dog to read. you'll get there! don't give up!
and i didn't realize how much my dog meant to me until after he was gone. enjoy the time you have with others. it's worth it.
my golden does this, except he also does an adorable whine/groan with the toy and his mouth. much better than barking with excitement
my dog used to jump all over people as soon as they came through the door. he would get down when you told him, but then his doggy impulses overrode his brain and he'd jump back up again. so to refocus all that excitement off of the people, i started asking him, "where's your toy?" he's go find it and proudly bring it back to show you, tail wagging. now he no longer jumps on people when they come in the door but instead greets them with a wagging tail and a toy in his mouth. :)
my dogs always bring our shoes and they won't let go of them until you pat them and say "good girl". sometimes they would get cheeky and try to steal them away while you're trying them on. *sigh* i miss my dogs :(
it's the eyebrows changing that makes me laugh every time
yeah but it's like.. puppy, what do you want me to grab on to? the majority of the toy is in your mouth!
same here with my golden. when i get home from work we have to keep a toy by the door so he doesn't walk around with a shoe. the butt wiggle accompanied by a low pitch *hooarrgghhrrggllelllllllllgrrrrrrl* and getting him more excited only makes the noises more hilarious
get some more. or volunteer at a shelter if you have nowhere to keep them. my heart breaks every time i have to say goodbye to my fur babies, but i always end up getting just one more. there are so many out there who need our love, and frankly, we need their love even more.
"dogs reacting to being called a good boy" is the wholesome meme we've been looking for all these years
somehow i knew exactly what both of these would be
hot steamy jesus, they're dogs. they don't care if your hand gets in their mouth a little and they're not going to bite you.
i moved countries to come live with my bf and my dogs stayed back home with my parents. i'm always asking my mom to show them on skype every time we skype. i'd love to get another pup but me and my bf work full time and we barely have time outside work and i wouldn't like to leave the dog behind all alone. i'd also love to volunteer at a shelter but i'm a very sensitive person and every time i see a stray or abused dog i end up crying so i don't know how i'd handle myself volunteering there... :(
"dogs reacting to being called a good boy is the wholesome meme we've been looking for all these years!" says u/ervin_pepper of the chicago tribune
does the rest of the pepper, pepper & bayleaf firm also feel that way?
my dog just likes to play chase. he'll walk up to me with the toy in his mouth and if i get my hand with the same postal code of him, he sprints away at mach 4.
i don't know about you, but if i stick my hand in my dog's mouth during tug of war, there's a pretty damn good chance that he's going to accidentally chomp down on my hand. i've seen him punch holes in steel cans, so i'd rather avoid that.
my dog will bite you!!! he's bitten me plenty of times (he was abused by previous owners so he's a little aggressive). i've got scars all of my hands from accidental and on purpose bites. if you have a dog, he might bite you. it's a small risk for the amount of love they have to give.
and if they do you exaggeratedly go ouch! then they learn not to do it, or be more careful in the future. dogs (and cats) don't instintively have the ability to modify their bites, it's all or nothing. they learn through trial and error while playing to control their bites.
i have been on reddit for 3 years, i have posted hundreds of comments, maybe even thousands, in a variety of subreddits, and you are the first person who has ever replied with the reference that my username is referring to. thank you, comrade vlad. much obliged
this is my dachshund's number one game. while my friend's dachshund will gladly bring what you threw...mine will only bring it back about 2-3 ft away from me and proceed to sprint off if i even make any motions to the toy. it's def a game you have to be in the mood for...
your puppy knows the difference btwn a hard can and your soft hand- give him a little trust and remember to exhibit discomfort bodily. your baby loves you
this has happened to me multiple times. my dog accidentally bites me when she tries to readjust her grip on the toy we're tugging.
what the heck. i didnt have to teach my momma dog not to bite through her kids neck or my other dogs not to tear each other up while they were playing.
that's surprising, considering how popular the wire if on here.
exactly. you just need to let them know how much pressure they are allowed to apply to you. it is the same thing pups do when playing with other pups. when my pups are young i wrestle with them a ton. i really like to play rough with them (they also learn they are allowed to play rough with me, but not with my wife or other family members). i don't mind them biting me, but if it is too hard i yelp and stop playing with them for a few seconds. they learn to control it very well. i have done this with smaller 50lb dogs all the way up to 150lb rottweilers.
yeah, the first bite i ever got from him was so sad. he pooped in the house and i was upset with him ( i'm such a softie i barely yelled ) and he started lowering his head and sort of blinking weird whenever i got close. so i thought he had something in his eye and went to get it out and he bit me. then he really started doing it and i realized he wasn't blinking he was flinching. i didn't even know dogs could do that! hell i only knew because my dad used to beat my ass all the time, then my boyfriends so i grew up flinching. people make fun of me for it but its ok, my dog and i will flinch together :)
do you remember the last time a fired reddit employee did an ama? i highly suggest she take all this online goodwill and get a high paying, lucrative pr job.
her doing an ama would unleash more popcorn than when the last employee got fired
holy shit that was fast. i totally support this request. maybe she can get help from victoria :)
i doubt that she will. i'll bet that when she signed her contract to work for reddit she signed a non-disclosure agreement or something of that nature which prohibits her from discussing her firing.
she almost certainly has a confidentiality agreement
what the fuck?! i leave for 3 hours and this has dropped from 10k votes to 5k? uhm... something's fishy, here.
holy shit...14532 and 97% upvoted never thought i'd see that unless snowden and assange announced they were getting married.
i just want her to do an ama so we can salute her o7
now do one for the creator of secret santa too. it's not just victoria. reddit wants to gut the heart of the company apparently. apparently having a popular site isn't enough for them, and so they want the real fans that helped build the site, get stepped on until they fall in line.
guys, can we please stop buying reddit gold for a day. i feel like that'll make more of statement than the blackout bullshit. that money goes to support reddit's higher ups.
why the hell would she want to come back to add publicity to the site she got fired from? and why would we want to demean her by asking her to do that?
if you are very interested in seeing this happen, consider posting in /r/iamarequests and offering reddit gold for contacting this person and arranging the ama! your request will have a better chance at being fulfilled than just being posted here! and if you do post in /r/iamarequests, make sure to tag your request with [reward] if you're offering one, or [no reward] if not. users, if you want to help contact potential ama participants (and earn reddit gold) then subscribe to /r/iamarequests! *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/iama) if you have any questions or concerns.*
1. why are you so awesome? 2. will you be my friend? 3. considering all you have done to help the reddit (ama), community, how would you like to see the sub evolve, grow, or change (or not)? 4. coke or pepsi?
"sons of reddit, i am victoria." "victoria is 7 feet tall!" "yes, i've heard. gilds men by the hundreds, and if she were here she'd consume ellen pao with fireballs from her eyes and bolts of downvotes from her arse. i am victoria, and i see a whole army of redditors, here in defiance of tyranny. you have come to comment as free redditors, and free redditors you are. what would you do without freedom? will you fight?" "fight? against pao? no, we will jump ship to voat.co, and we will post." "aye, post and you may be banned. jump ship to voat and you'll post-- at least for a while. and posting in your forums many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the comments from this day to that for one chance to come back here and tell the admins that they may ban our accounts, but they'll never ban, our freedom!"
could you shed some light on the "last employee"? don't think i was around for that one.
#karmatrain but in all seriousness i want to see her side on this issue, as its the most important
i know her number. i'll try to call her. haven't talked to her in a while though.
which they can, now. it's one, big, gay, whistleblower wedding!
ne questions, it just gets gilded like a million times. actually that would mean buying gold. idk. some shit along those lines.
my guess is they are prepping for 1. sale to an outside company. 2. pay access. and ditching people with issues with 1 and/or 2. but im wrong a lot.
we might be taking a break from "reddit gold" for a while automoderator.
that's the exact string of comments i want to see on this. a question of "what happened/why were you fired" then victoria's perspective and reddit's perspective. on one hand, i feel like *maybe* victoria wasn't 100% innocent in this, but on the other hand if that were the case then someone at reddit would have explained how she screwed up. until we have that answer, all we can do is guess and that's not working out in reddit's favor right now.
and the verification picture is just her holding up a mirror.
god damn that was such a ridiculous response from him. it's a perfect example of the serious disconnect between the community and the company.
i would literally have to delete my reddit app to do this. it's just common nature now to tap on it, sometimes i instinctively tap it right after i've just closed it. i am willing to do this however.
but...but i have a four hour train ride with wifi...
i really hope she didn't have to sign an nda to get a severance package or something.
if she needs time to recover from the stress of being jobless and such, tell her there is no rush whatsoever. her well-being is the most important
yes exactly. no buying gold until all of this has been sorted out.
that wouldn't be very professional. even if she had done something terrible, it's in everyone's best interest to say nothing.
wow, she's helping with the ama of the 2006 time person of the year?
or one for reddit. word on the street is there are some redditors in the works of creating a whole new website, similar to reddit, without the bullshit administration issue. cough cough
id have to move it off my homepage to have the same effect lol
same here. the second i have nothing to do, my phone comes out, i swipe 3 times to the left, then click in the bottom left corner. commence an hour of me staring at my phone, then randomly gigglesnort every 15 minutes. people think i'm weird.
or make it an "explore the rest of the internet" day.
i'll be browsing voat. if the guy on the bike powering it is awake that is
it would be very impressive if it became an annual thing where the site just goes dead for a day
if you make the front page but no one reads it, did you really make the front page
if it reaches top ama post of all time i will eat a pair of my underwear (washed of course but still fairly used) i will film myself too. screenshot this comment if you want but im serious
you know that reddit has a few years of gold more than required? /r/thebutton paid 6,5 months of gold in 2 months. so we'd have to give no gold for a very long time.
lpt: how to get a good reputation for being a medicore ceo: hire pao
no no... zelda is the horse. link is the sword.
had to look that up. really cool cover by time, clever i'd say!
you have reddit as your homepage? how do you accomplish anything?
now i wanna make vacation brochures for other websites. tumblr; come and explore your sjw side! facebook; everyone you hate! 4chan; the department of state warns u.s. citizens against all but essential travel to 4chan. travel within 4chan remains dangerous given the security situation.
there's more to the internet than reddit? (mommy im scared)
how can the front page exist if reddit no longer exists?
have you properly researched health hazards of either eating underwear or not delivering on a promise to the people of reddit? either way, too late. you're on the hook now.
i stopped reading months ago, has he seriously never resolved any of that shit? what happened to vp?
it's about the symbolic gesture in these dire times, not about the actual money acquired. i'd say that until we receive a proper explanation and a ***sincere*** excuse over all of this, we stop giving gold altogether.
he implemented the policy of forced relocation to san francisco for all reddit employees. he tried to implement reddit notes which was going to be a bitcoin clone. considered by all to be a bad idea. then there was the reddit marketplace that did nothing but sell horrible t-shirts and other crap. also a horrible move.
just being honest, is there any reason to trust the ceo over the employee? has either's claims been substantiated?
my last semester's 2.75 gpa would like to show you how i do it
there's so much else on tumblr besides "sjw stuff" though. how it works is, you only see what you choose to follow. and the porn is great.
there is but it's a disjointed fucked up way to internet just opening google.com and thinking of things to internet. life before reddit on the internet is a blur.
i have enough heart problems where i'll probably die before 40, 30 if i continue my current diet :p
okay with the exception of the sf move (which even that i guess i can understand) those are dumb ideas in hindsight but i'd take someone being enthusiastic and trying their best over this.
i can't tell if that's supposed to be good or not.
you're not cool until you've eaten something for karma.
and how musical chairs is played. i think we're on to something here
even the relocation doesnt seem too unreasonable as a business decision. i was expecting to learn what a shitty person yishan really was, not "uhhh he made a bitcoin clone and sold some reddit t-shirts"...
it's impressively average. 2.0 is passing for most american universities, while 4.0 is all a's.
yeah, it's hard to monetise a site like reddit. i'd rather they merchandise than try to sanitise the site for sponsorships and ads.
many programs require maintaining a 3.0 or 3.25 in your major. 2.0 passing would be pretty rare i think.
my nephew was three and got a pair of these shoes. we had to take them away from him. he would walk with his head down so he could see his shoes lighting up and was constantly hitting his head and falling over. at first it was pretty funny, but then it started to be a problem.
people who say that they'll never be as happy as when they were kids, this is the video that proves you wrong.
light up shoes really haven't been given the appreciation they deserve... until now
i can just see him walking around town with a big ol' grin on his face not giving a fuck about anything because he's wearing his light-up shoes.
i need to start saying "get outta town!" when i'm excited about something
someway somehow mostly all of the old people turn into a child when they get old enough. we start it that way, and we end it that way, that's the beauty of life.
3 hours and already 13,000 upvotes? this post is going down is history.
i'm a hell of a lot happier in a boring 9-5 than i was as a social outcast with no money in highschool, that's for sure.
nintendo sixty foooooooo... i mean, shoooooooooes!
old people are just giant, wrinkly, toddlers. you can't convince me otherwise, nor do i think it's a negative. toddlers rule, after all.
i mean, i appreciated the shit out of my light up shoes when i was seven. i loved those things.
i love old man curses. i say em all the time "oh for the love of pete" my favorite is "oh for cryin in a bucket" close runners up would be dagnabit, and horsefeathers
"oh shit! it's armed! everybody get do-oooaaaahhhh!"
yeah, he's a split second away from throwing the shoe out the window and ducking behind the couch.
he seems a bit old for nam. actually, wait. fuck i'm old.
compared to most redditors, i'm ancient at 42. life has never been better. i've got money, i'm in fantastic shape, and i'm finally comfortable talking to high school girls.
yeah, fuck, i'm *way* happier than i've ever been before, and i'm probably in the most stressful time of my life right now. i guess you just come to terms with the person you are and start to get the balance right between caring what other people think and do, and having confidence in yourself and your own decisions.
i kind of miss college (i don't miss the hours of homework though) but i like having money and more free time in my dead-end 9-5 job nowadays. although soon i'll be having a baby so we'll see how i feel after that! either way i'm a helluva lot happier than i was as a kid in an abusive household, and a depressed social outcast in high school.
well that makes one of you. a lot of people i know talk about their desk job like they're gonna shoot the place up tomorrow.
can confirm. i work in the dining room of a retirement home. yesterday i witnessed a lady dance her chicken legs across her plate while singing a little song, and had an entire table of old people insist on calling the potato wedges "potato wedgies" and giggle about it.
i came to that conclusion when i realized that the older my parents got the more they seemed to regress in maturity.
wow... thats a lot more clickbaity than i wanted it to be :(
"these are some pretty neat shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhoooooookkh my god charlie is hiding in the shooooooeeeeeeeesssss!"
shit, i must be about to die, i'm almost down to 0 fucks given.
just wait until you are 47! every year is the best year of my life. however, a friend of mine who is now 60 says that stopped for him last year. :-(
45 royally out of shape, still poor as fuck and life generally sucks balls. i hate you.
actually not neccesarily true the "unhappy" are generally pessimistic and will prepare more compared to the happy and optimistic.
youre right. all of those 95 year olds are content with all of their pleasant memories of the great depression.
but at least now i can afford to medicate my soul crushing depression with amazon prime orders.
i thought he was referring to his style specifically. people tend to stick to theirs, so when you're old nobody really cares because "it was probably cool back then" or something. thing is, when others weren't around to know that's not really the case, you can get away with more... that's how i took it anyway.
i once asked an elderly pt "how do you feel" "eh?" i repeated 3 more times, getting progressively louder. on the last "how do you feel?!?" practically screamed in his face. he wriggled his fingers at me, "with my hands!" with a twinkle in his eye.
his actual voice sounded just like how i imagined when i read it out.
i must be one of the few who prefer videos over soundless gifvs. i want sound in 2016 goddamnit.
i'm honestly jealous :-( i need to give less fucks.
and the number of people missing the dazed and confused reference...
42 year olds now aren't as damaged as we will be when we're 42. they missed both world wars and most were too young to be caught up in the conflicts that followed. we however, still have to look forward to the mind wars of 2024, the great magnetic reversal of 2027 and the dead generation of 2034.
just did three days ago. i'd say i feel great except i also caught my son's cold and feel like crap. i think the fun in life will probably start diminishing about the time my future grandkids start heading off to college.
and the high school girls? how are we in that department?
suicide is a major cause of death in the us. it is primarily a source of mortality for those who are on the unhappy side of the balancing point.
i'm going to remember that one to use when i'm old. wait, i'm old now: i'm using it, if i can remember it... what did you ask?
you and me, both. i love reddit as a group, but i can't understand its hatred towards videos.
protip: find something you love. do that thing. when something negative happens just think, "fuck this, i am going back to doing what i love". fill your life with only the best things in your life, and every morning while making your coffee/tea/cap'n crunch remind yourself how great your life has become, and work toward what can make your life a little better at a time.
oh they do. my grandfather gave absolutely 0 fucks. dude would do crazy shit and always said: "what are they gunna do to me? i am an old vet"
beggars can't be choosers, bitch this ain't chipotle
you know you're old when the throwback movie to your youth is itself too old to be remembered.
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. don't remind me about the mind wars. that's gonna suck. hard. my brain already hurts.
and then the great socialist revolution of 2040 and in 2050 the human race is basking in the glory that is fully automated luxury communism!
well that is great to hear! my friend is still enjoying life. his reasoning was more about how your body really starts to fall apart quickly and you don't have the energy that you used to. eh, he still seems happy to me when he is not complaining about his back!
are you *trying* to get me to commit suicide? because that's feckin' savage, mate.
the moment amazon prime now started delivering booze, i knew the world was coming to an end. but i had booze, and could handle it.
apple just takes out the footholes and you have to use a special sock.
iirc there was a big issue a few years back where people kept accidentally slipping on the heels when they were trying to walk down stairs and such. do you ever have that problem?
sadly men can't get away with this in public so easily. instead of children and the elderly getting a giggle everyone would just be staring at you like you aren't acting your age.
it is awesome, and it sucks. weird but you love it.
yes, use something as escape, end doing it all the time and ruin your life, because you stopped doing everything you dislike. that's how you become addict/fat.
i volunteer regularly at a clinic (because i like to) but a lot of people that volunteer there are 18-20 and going to college, trying to get into medical school. i mentioned waynes world the other day to them and began feeling like an old man. none of them knew what is was. i'm only 29...
barely. the true cost of that conflict will never be known. i still have flash backs and violent diarhhiaa every time i hear the "taste the feeling" jingle.
... and call me a conspiracy theorist, but don't you think that the mind wars had something to do with that great magnetic reversal? shit's about to get real!
until the great recycling crisis of 2078. nobody cared that the poor were going missing. nobody cared that meat farms were all shut down but the meat kept coming. nobody cared until the laughing disease struck down almost a billion people over the next month - almost half of the surviving humans.
yeah, chronic pain can be hard for people to overcome. i know a lot of my friends my age are trying hard to get in and stay in shape so that the energy is there. helps that now there is a lot more time to exercise than when the kids were young.
no, i'm a girl and sometimes i wear high heels, which is perfect training for regular walking in heelys. the only time i have trouble is if a parking lot has some pea gravel in it. it turns the whole shoe into a skate, your foot will slip. it's just up to you whether you slowly sink to the ground because no brakes or if you're walking fast enough, bust your ass. i have some pretty cool scars but having wheels on your shoes is like asking to get them.
yep. you can either have moments of total amazement, change your perspective on life, feel totally fulfilled in having the job of preparing someone for the world, to better the world, be more terrified than you ever thought possible, frustrate yourself to the point of insanity, and hate yourself, and your own parents sometimes, or.... just continue on your path as it is.
you won't get the appreciation you deserve for this one but i see you!
that sounds horrible. here, have some new coke, it'll help.
look at this hipster already wanting to be part of the dead generation.
soylent green is *people*! soylent green is *people*! soylent blue is.... well, nobody's really sure what *that* shits made of. hopefully, not worse than *people*! soylent green is *people*!
i had heelys when i was in 4th or 5th grade, i remember there being an insert you could put in place of the wheels so you could walk normally
you won't get the appreciation you deserve for this either because i had the same exact response as your post
alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright
the correct line is "now we gonna break this thing down in just a few seconds"
yeah but it's terribly inconvenient to change them and you aren't always thinking about it. i can get away with just wearing the whole bit and carrying the plugs in my purse. very rarely do i have to actually put them in. super side effect: the shoes themselves are 13 years old. they're still as comfy as the day i bought them. easily the most durable shoe i've ever owned. i would gladly buy another pair and never put wheels in them just so i could have a pair of indestructible shoes.

yea, my dog bites the everliving shit out of his favorite toy.
i love how the initial reaction is like "no fucking way"
you can notice the exact second the dog is trying to comprehend what the fuck is going on
the look of awe on that dogs face though. like meeting a cherished celebrity
that's cute. my dog would destroy that stuffed toy in about 30 seconds. i don't buy destroyable toys for him anymore.
i think he's initially confused because he smells his master. then he goes to investigate and then gets happy when he's sure.
wow this post has 12,000 upvotes in three hours. crazy
that's a golden for you though, super super gentle, known as "soft bite." hell you can give them egg to play with and they wont break the shell.
i'm confused. does the dog recognise that it's an enlarged version of its toy, or is it just excited to see a big green thing?
and the moment it sniffs and knows precisely who it is.
seriously you need to learn dog body language, there's no happiness, it's visibly stressful for him.
was convinced it was going to be the dog panicking and running away for a cheap laugh. pleasantly surprised when the dog approached with reverence and awe.
one of those weird ones -- can a dog have the interpretive skills to understand that's a giant-ass gumby?
holy shit, that is crazy. wonder if it's anything to do with the reddit backend weirdness that's been happening recently.
can confirm his confirmation. source: had golden :,(
is your dog full blue heeler or mixed? we have a little heeler lab mix we just rescued and her coloring looks exactly like your dogs! i'm wondering if she's gonna be your little one's size or bigger.
yeah, mine gnawled one of those indestructible hard rubber toys, a kong i think, to pieces. yet his favorite toy, a paper thin rubber duck, is 8 years old and not a scratch.
i think the dog doesn't recognize who this strange large thing is, and then it smells that it's his owner and is super excited that it's his beloved owner who he now gets to cuddle with.
lol, she pushed the other dog off. "back off, dave. this is mine"
yeah... this is super cute but the dog's reaction is less "oh wow a giant toy?!" and more "what the hell... uum... *sniff* oh hey, dave!"
that'd be one sweaty stinky gumby at a phish show.
neeeaaar, faaaaar, wherevvvverrrrr you aaaarf. ftfy
i know the person in the costume is just doing their job, but seriously, props to them. i never really cared for micky myself, but it's just awesome to give kids experiences like that. it's funny, i used to think that kind of stuff was lame, but i guess existential depression really makes you rethink the value of all that stuff. sorry for digging this weird introspective hole.. i'll be going now.
pretty sure mythbusters did an episode proving your dog recognizes you by your face.
they can recognize different toys when referred to them by name, and pick them out of a pile. source - my own chocolate lab
probaly but it's even more confused why his master has changed form. imagine if you mom showed up but her voice was a man when she spoke.....freaky as f***.
i had a black lab :( if only i could retrieve her.
it's amazing how dogs can smell stuff and know exactly how to act, like when mine recognises my brothers dog isn't a threat or when he smells the vet and knows to shit on the floor.
my dog's name is dave. he'd be very confused if he smelled himself in that costume.
that's because it's not an actual gif, but a video.
that made me laugh for a second then i remembered the context and now i'm sad.
oh. my. god. that is such a beautiful dog! forgive my enthusiasm, i just woke up, and it's sooooooh. my. god. i want oneeeeee
what is this from? seems like something i need more of
except that place isn't about hd gifs. it's about putting big letters on the gif and then sucking your own cock
i had a lap and pit mix. dumbest dog in the world, but the most lovable and gentle dog. he harried around rocks in how mouth. i miss him so much.
everything except for the shedding.... i'll take a chocolate any day over a golden.
tens of thousands of years of co-operation. dogs are pretty amazing creatures, but they're only amazing because we share a pretty deep bond with them. grow up around elephants and you'll probably say the same things! that said, many people still see dogs as tools - a lot of the time on farms, dogs are purpose-bred - protect livestock, hunt, herd sheep, retrieve game, control vermin, or even combinations thereof! i worked in saskatchewan for awhile, and the pets for adoption/rehoming were border collies and other work dogs whose descriptions were either "good working stock, has good instincts, needs new home", or "lame in right hip, needs new home", if you see what i mean. it doesn't mean that we're callous or bad humans. if anything, it's a testament to the versatility of canines - they can be our best friends, or we can use them as their instincts bred them to be used. it's a pretty amazing spectrum!
i find it to be the most infuriatingly uninteresting subreddit in existence.
the meta gifs are so shit, they just circlejerk about how 'good' they and other users are. the rare non-meta ones are pretty good imo
paging /u/editingandlayout, /u/preggit, /u/matt01ss
well that's neat as hell. thank you for the comment
i had a friend who had a blue heeler. which is what we call dogs like yours (cattle dogs) in the states, most of the time. they are definitely a handful. especially as puppies. i can only imagine how much trouble she is. but i'll bet she's worth every bit. she's super pretty.
in my experience, people and dogs who work together have the closest relationships. source: grew up in texas, cattle dogs and hunting dogs everywhere.
we've bred it in so much too that they want to do these jobs. some dogs have the urge to retrieve, some to hunt, some to dig or to herd. it's cool that they have a purpose so engrained in their bloodline that they have a base desire to do it without training.
yeah initially it was just higher quality versions of reaction gifs and classic gifs with text. now it's meta circlejerking short films.
dude, don rosa's 'the life and times of scrooge mcduck' is a masterpiece of western literature. we love 'em ducks over here. i never got america's love affair with superheroes, when there's the duck clan of duckburg, calisota.
i have seen the opposite (on occasion). people that see dogs as "tools" seem unable to see them as loving pets and treat them only as a thing and not a thinking creature. which i find disturbing.
i totally get why people hate it but i love it. it feels like an actual community once you spend some time there.
i feel like i've found a home for the first time :')
my parents breed and raise these dogs. they are always running. always.
when the zeppelin goes, sometimes it's like everyone stops shooting and looks up. because if you don't, it's gonna land on you. yes, it is. every fucking time.
i hope in the full video he waits till the guy runs all the way to the end and jumps towards a passing plane to save him........ then snipes him in mid air
"come over." "my zeppelin is exploding." "my parents aren't home."
r/gifsthatendtoosoon ..but really, that was epic!
honestly if this were to occur in wwi by some possibility and i was the sniper id let that og live to tell the tale how he surfed on a burning zeppelin.
"oh crap oh crap oh crap oh crap running running running running!"
"get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof!"
how did people think battle zeppelins were a good idea? theyre literally floating bombs.
well, damn. now i need to watch it. the mob and fbi teaming up to fight germans never gets old
i think that really captures the feel of wwi. like, "last month i was a dirt farmer and now the sky is falling"
even if you're underground in a damn bunker *you still die*.
just wondering as someone who hasn't played the game... are there any scenarios in battlefield 1 that involve a zeppelin, where the zeppelin doesn't explode in flammable ball of fiery satisfaction? because it seems to me like a real "chekhov's gun" thing to put in the game, even in multiplayer.
he runs to the end of the zeppelin and jumps off doing a 360 no scope to an enemy pilot and then lands in the cockpit of the stolen plane and flies off into the sunset
lucky this is based on wwi, the geneva convention outlawed shooting parachuting soldiers.
seriously, that was probably the coolest bf video i've ever seen even if it was something so simple.
but it did end too soon. badass jump or badass headshot?
do all classes have parachutes? otherwise this might be the first case where the prometheus school of running away from things might be successful
*"i saw him deploy a parachute at 100 feet! his genes need to carry on"*
god i loved that game...also killin' people with drop pods.
battlefield vietnam was my favourite. the soundtrack to that game was epic, riding in the back of a jeep firing the .50 cal with fortunate son blasting on the radio
battlefield 2142 is when i upgraded to jihad transport helicopters straight into them walkers. great game!
wow, the trailer movies from bf1 look 100x better than this
that ladder approaching them... were they flying at 9 miles per hour?
in reality, zeppelins could fly high enough that most planes' and ground-based weapons couldn't reach them. also, their interiors were segmented so a few punctures wouldn't deflate them, and regular bullets and shrapnel proved not to ignite them. special explosive and incendiary rounds had to be developed to do the job. when the war began, zeppelins were the most developed form of aviation in the world, and were the one area where germany were firmly ahead of everyone else. it would have been dumb *not* to try to use them to their advantage, despite their vulnerabilities.
i won't lie -- it's not my vid, i just saw the gif in the web, on russian network vk. if someone knows how it ends and whether the sniper makes the shot or not -- please do tell!
i love that glance they give each other when they're blasting.
at least we know what he's thinking "fffuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkk!!!!"
-music cuts-. freeze frame. "i bet youre wondering how i got on top of that burning zepplin."..
maybe the fire consumes the oxygen? that's the whole point of flamethrowers. point it into a bunker and asphyxiate everyone inside, and of course burn them to death. but, you know, from the lungs-out.
it comes out when the losing team falls behind by a certain degree, to give them a fighting chance. it can seat multiple players and has some hellacious firepower, and it takes a lot to destroy it. but when it does go...and it almost always does eventually...it's pretty amazing to watch. it's absolutely massive, so you end up in these nightmare-like scenarios where you're running, and *feel* like you should be safely out of the way...it doesn't look like it's coming down or moving laterally all that fast. but that's because it's so fucking huge. it's still over you. still over you. still over you. splat. some maps have an armored train or a battleship instead. it's not the same though.
good thing everybody follows all the rules of war!
but were parachuting soldiers allowed to fire on enemies below?
i see amazing bf1 vids all the time on reddit. maybe it's time to just break down and buy the game. be a part of the madness!
no its not, in op's gif the game mode is operations whereas your's is conquest.
nah, it was the choppers blaring the ride of the valkyries for me.
a redditor stealing content! now i've heard it all.
probably not, it's an artillery truck aiming at him, not a sniper.
i was thinking more like: fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
it was just ahead of its time. 20 years later, the same director made another movie with the same basic premise (mid-century super hero fighting nazis of dubious historical accuracy) that makes 5 times as much at the box office, and gets 2 sequels.
i loved this movie and the insanely difficult nes game that came along after.
"well, it all started three weeks ago when..." *vhs rewinding*
and that is why the thermobaric bomb is the most terrifying weapon in modern war. you might survive the initial strike, but that blast is going to form a vacuum so strong it pulls your lungs out your mouth.
i love defending that point. i just set down an ammo crate and packs and spam incendiary grenades at a doorway in between lmg spam .
it is such a better gimmick than the bf4 levolutions. i thought at first i'd hate the behemoths but they haven't gotten old yet. they feel balanced enough for the most part.
you forgot the random piece of debris that touches your plane wing then causes you to hurdle towards the ground at 500000mph
well, if you don't, you'll get a strongly worded letter from the league of nations sent to your house
the geneva article only provides protection to crews ejecting from doomed aircraft. upon leaving their aircraft, they are considered non-combatants and it is a war crime to fire on them. if they open fire while descending, however, they void their protection. paratroopers, on the other hand, are not protected by the geneva article, and are legitimate targets even while descending.
its totally worth it. ive already put more hours into it than i did for bf4help me i need a life
i won't lie -- it's not my vid, i just saw the gif in the web, on russian network vk so i just posted it here for you guys. if someone knows how it ends and whether the sniper makes the shot or not -- please do tell!
"stealing content" do you know what reddit actually is?
45 and still flaming. i wonder why she isn't in as many movies lately, she's a great actress.
i couldn't even pass the first level. i believe it was the plane racing. it was just flying in loops and i couldn't figure that shit out.
*it all started when i get sick and tired of zip pushing me around*
*rewinds too far* woops did not mean for you to see that
how do you replenish your dirt supply after it's been harvested?
the most terrifying? what about everyone getting shot in the dick?
i love assaulting that point. every time i die i get to try something new to break through.
or the lag comp bounces you back out of the cockpit a full second later and you land outside ground battlefield. within seconds your god of choice executes you for desertion.
"then the league of nations said 'no, if you're in the league of nations you're not supposed to take over the world'. and japan said, 'how about i do, any way!'".
how do you tell the difference if you don't see the plane?
same. i got a cod after bf4 and never really looked back but this time i haven't gotten the newest cod and the only reason i would is to play mw4 again...
great, now i have a weird version of the mash theme song stuck in my head!
a redditor stealing content! now i've heard it all.
sorry for the dumb question but what is this clip? i haven't seen the rocketeer since it was in theatres and there's obviously video game footage interspersed...
all the time. my toilet paper machine is actually listed as banned on the sidebar for being posted too often. i checkout everyone's shitty robots :)
i had the exact same experience. i found out later that you were supposed to alternate pressing left, right, left, right quickly to make the plane go faster but there was no indication that that's what you were supposed to do. ahh, the good old days when you were expected to read a manual or just figure things out on your own. a blessing and a curse.
but wait a second i'm getting ahead of myself, let's rewind a bit. *1980s feel good pop song plays*
*fast-forwards for a sec* *freeze frame on the hero punching out a giant dude in a shitty tavern* "ah, there we go."
you head on down to the sipsco dirt factory of course. big money, big women, big fun.
several years ago... forgive me if i am not seeing the connection
rifle grenades.... all of the rifle grenades ever.
bf2142 and bf2 revive, one character for both games. comes with installer for both games.
i think you folks that do these ironic shitty robots are really inspiring. i think a big barrier to people starting their own projects is coming up with that one project that is supposed to be useful in some way and it can be intimidating and paralyzing. it's too serious and intense. this technique of building robots shows people that you can still be artistic, funny, and lighthearted while still learning how to build things can really take that intimidating edge off the learning process for beginners.
just like me. except i wasn't punching anyone out. and instead of in a tavern i was in my own kitchen. the "shitty" part is accurate, though.
oh damn, i was playing bf2 revive a few months ago but didn't know they were working on a 2142 revival! defs playing when i get home.
thank you i appreciate that and i feel the same about making robotics less intimidating. you don't need to be good at it and you don't need to make anything useful, come to /r/shittyrobots and make shit with us :)
i just got that song out of my fucking head! not again!
frustrated with the inconsistency, my search to find and kill katrina began. first, i'd need to locate the waves. *driving montage begins*
i always eat the toast butter side down so i can taste the butter first on my tongue.
tell us how you feel when you accomplish these things. sincerely interested.
congrats, bro! i've been a c5 quad for five years and got to spend some time in the ekso. great feeling! where do you rehab at?
wow that is so awesome. how exactly does it help/let you walk?
have you always been quadriplegic? if not, how did this experience compare to walking unassisted?
can you please scream the following? iiiiiiiiiiii aaaaammmmmmm iiiiiiirrrrrroonnnnnnnnnn mmmaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn!!!!!
dude! can you walk on walls and jump 10 meters high like cod ? [btw you look great, keep up the good work :)](/spoiler)
ok this is going to sound like a dumb question... but i am going to ask anyway. does being a quadriplegic mean you can't consciously control your muscles? like would your leg move / twitch away if you brought something hot in contact with it? or is everything just numb? hope you are doing well
not to be a dick but you could be darth vader some day. happy for you man.
as a man with a recent spinal cord injury and who has just been discharged from hospital after 5 months..this is fucking awesome! well done!
man, just a couple hundred years ago, i doubt you would have been given a second thought. i'm glad i'm alive now best of luck to you
can you feel stuff like stomach aches and your heart beating and more importantly, can you teach the exoskeleton to give you some dope-ass dance moves?
hi! congratulation on your amazing achievement, which exoskeleton is that one? i have a wife in a wheelchair, and this looks amazing! she has been very depressed because she was really active and after the accident she can't do anything like before, so it's very frustrating for her.
how long have you been paralyzed? how long after you were diagnosed for you begin this specific training? and what are your goals for long term? congratulations!!! also
that's pretty rad man. this is something that would make for a cool ama.
does your dick still function? if yes, can you feel it or does it work in an almost mockingly sort of way? hope this is okay to ask
how much do one of these cost? asking for a "friend"
hey i probably don't understand the terminology correctly. but if you use a walker normally, doesn't that mean you can use your arms? would that make you a paraplegic and not a quadriplegic? thanks for correcting my ignorance! :p
it feels awesome. being a quadriplegic comes with a lot of mental anguish so when these kind of things happen it really puts your mind at ease and makes you feel hopeful.
i usually do my rehab in baltimore at kennedy krieger institute but lately i've been doing it at sheltering arms in richmond because i applied to vcu so i'm giving this place a test run in case i move there
it's kind of like a segway. you lean forward and it starts walking. my physical therapist also has it synced up to an iphone app to help control it.
i haven't. i broke my neck in a bmx accident 8 years ago. of course walking unassisted is unbeatable but this is still pretty damn awesome. i forgot how tall i am when i'm walking. it's also really weird looking down and seeing my feet move underneath me since i still can't feel my legs.
well they did just send the exoskeleton to get upgraded recently so fingers crossed for wall walking
that's my goal. archers never breaking my legs again
not dumb at all. lots of quadriplegics have muscle spasms constantly anyways. some more severe than others. everything definitely feels numb. as far as putting a hotplate on my leg or feeling pain, my body feels it but i don't. it triggers what's called autonomic dysreflexia. so basically since i can't feel it my body's response is to raise my blood pressure very high to the point where i get really bad headaches and i get cold sweats. and this usually doesn't go away till i find the cause of it.
not a dick. it's extremely hard to offend me. rebel scum...
how have things been for you since leaving the hospital? was the first drive home pretty difficult for you? hope you're doing well man
i can. i asked them to turn on the breakdance feature but they said i have been earned that yet
i broke my neck 8 years ago in a bmx accident. it's hard to describe the feeling but i definitely can't stop smiling when i use it. i forget how tall i am because i'm usually sitting down. the weirdest part is looking down at my feet and watching them move like they used to. especially because i have no feeling in my legs.
hey good luck to the two of you. i believe he mentioned it further up if you haven't seen it yet. it's not the same but i was just bedridden and told that i may be disabled, for about 8 months and then i slowly got better, but it was definitely very tough. hope you find something that helps! i wonder if they make exoskeletons for activities of daily living (adl). they must, it'd be strange if they don't.
8 years. i've been doing physical therapy since the injury but just started using the exoskeleton in september. long term goals i guess would be walking and independence
what do you want to know? i'll answer any question you throw at me.
i asked once but i can't remember the exact number. i'm pretty sure the number was above 10,000 though
i want to know the same thing. asking for my father.
i dated a quadriplegic man for a while. no, he didn't have feeling in his penis and we used viagra or cialis. he still got morning wood sometimes and sometimes could get hard unassisted. i never saw him orgasm and i think he said he only has like twice since his accident and he actually found it very unpleasant to have one he still enjoyed sex but obviously not because of the physical sensation in his penis. however, he did say he can still enjoy a bit of physical feeling in the sense that he can feel the rush from sex.
i'm not op obviously so his situation might be different. but quadriplegics (unsure if this term is offensive, sorry if it is) don't necessarily have loss of feeling. obviously some do, but it's more specifically loss of motor control. in fact googling quadriplegic will result in many stories about sex as and with quadriplegics.
do your arms support a lot of your weight when you walk?
dang doing what trick? i am curious as to what almost dying literally feels like.
ah u/wheresthatcat, my mortal oreo contest enemy. i've never let my defeat at the 50th annual junk food enthusiasts and distributors of such annual convention (or j.f.e.d.a.c for short), down.
congrats man, keep up the good work! can this be a long term solution for you? can you eventually get a setup like this and use it unassisted?
what's the benefit of doing this for therapy? is it more a psychological benefit, or is there a physical reason for it? btw, congrats!
can you share a situation where a part of your body that was numb was being damaged and you had that autonomic dysreflexia reaction?
how often do you have to buy new shoes? possible upside
hey so you can still use your hands? i thought quadriplegics couldnt use any limbs. how are you replying to all these comments? (not trying to sound insensitive)
i don't think they are actually available to purchase. still in the testing phase of development. they choose candidates based on who they feel would be the best for testing and development. i'm just spit balling but i would guess at a minimum $100k maybe $200k for a full exoskeleton once they are in full production. source: read a couple of articles about these last summer.
they do. i usually have a walker in front of me that i rest my forearms on
i was trying to double peg a handrail. it feels like when you order a pizza but they accidentally give you a salad
the answer to that question will always be not soon enough
he survived a broken neck, i think he can handle some oreos.
well, you've done it. you've killed him. good job, debbil doog.
they were the best of times, they were the worst of times... ah, who am i kidding, doc's got me down to 2 oreo thins a day and an insulin pump.
would be great if there was a way for you to add a small toothbrush mustache to that face so, just so it would fit your name better
not really. because i'm quadriplegic i don't have very good control of my trunk. so usually when i'm using the exoskeleton i have to have like three people on me. one person behind. another guiding the walker. and someone by my side to kind of hold my chest up.
you're just asking, nothing insensitive about it at all. i cannot use my hands. i still have use of my shoulders, biceps, and left wrist. for typing i use a combination of both voice recognition and typing with my knuckles one letter at a time since i have no use of my fingers. if i'm on my phone though, i have it velcroed to my armrest and i use my thumb to type and navigate.
even $100k is still a bargain compared to the potential future costs from lack of walking, muscle loss, full nursing care, wheelchairs, specialized cars, etc.
damn that's gonna be way out of our price range for a while. my dads been paralyzed since 2001 and i dream everyday that one day he'll walk me down the aisle. someone make something cheaper!!! :(
thems fighting words, pancakes are flat and flavorless breadcakes, waffles have valleys and hills of deliciousness.
aaaaah, *a walker* is one of those trays on a wheel i see sometimes. i thought it was a term you guys used about people that can walk. now it makes sense. i thought you where careful not to squish the walker in front of you, maybe it was a child, or a very short person.
time to build an exoskeleton that replaces legs with a bmx-bike lower body. half-man! half-pro-bmx-bike! i shall call it the wheel ch... wait shit.
80k to walk again? that's actually a decent price seeing as that many surgeries is gonna come out to that
you sir, underestimate the diarrhea caused by such an undertaking.
so then what does using the exoskeleton actually do for you, short or long term? i always figured it was something you would use forever, but i guess not! (sorry if this was already asked)
it's okay adolf, you also rallied a country during a great depression.
i don't know if you are being serious or not but i'm laughing like crazy
not really. i was just laying on the ground and my neck was really sore. just felt like i head banged at a concert for a long time
shit, i was missing a disc in my lower back and had fusion surgery to remedy the issue and the price tag just to do that was over $110k. $80k to help someone walk again seems extremely reasonable.
i know it's a long shot, but i'm curious as to what health insurance would be able to contribute to something like that
'sparing hitler' a romantic comedy supernatural sci fi thriller starring felix kjellberg, ethan klein, and op as the exosavior.
english is not my native language, i had to use my imagination and the most reasonable thing was that a walker is the term quadriplegics use for able bodied humans :(
it's really interesting how extremely severe injuries don't really hurt. from my experience a shattered elbow and broken neck you don't feel (didn't realize the neck was hurt until the next day). broken finger? fucking awful.
poor flimsy humans. don't you wish you were flawless like me? a towering inferno of physical perfection? (if you weren't quoting futurama, then this is an unfortunate coincidence, as without context, i would sound like an ass.)
usually adrenaline and survival instinct cuts through that pain as your body does what it evolved to do in those situations - make sure you survive. the body is really amazing. that said, i imagine he felt a lack of pain because he became literally crippled, and that likely involves the severing of many of the nerve systems that would transmit such pain ime - chronic pain is always worse than sudden pain. for example, i had my jaw smashed in, which took 4 years to fix, and 9 months wired shut. the actual smashing didn't hurt much, the following years did very badly
i severed my hand and shattered my right arm when i was 11. was in a cast for over 2 years and had to have it rebroken (while awake) multiple times, and eventually pins put in to stabilize the bones that kept shifting. pain was really severe after about 10 minutes, on the way to the hospital. for the first 10 minutes, i was dazed, felt nothing, ringing in my ears, the world was a shade of yellow as well, almost as if i were wearing those yellow colored sun glasses. never cried the entire time. was only after my father showed up and didn't care about me and started yelling at me for ruining the three-wheeler that i cried. fuck that guy. i get a papercut/stubbed toe though and i swear like a drunken sailor hah.
i broke my pinky and it honestly didn't even hurt too much, i just put ice on it and it wasn't noticiable, i find spraining is much worse.
that's what i thought at first, but then caught myself. no one can be that callous, is what i'd like to believe. like to.
that was the total price tag (including the hospital, neurosurgeon and his pa, and anesthesiology). insurance paid part of it and i paid part of it.
you shouldn't be so worried about it if it was.... a best friend when i was in high school was quadriplegic. told me something very helpful on how i should treat him. since we ribbed on each other, but never messed with him, it left him out. he didn't mind jokes about him or his ability...as long as he trusted we didn't mean anything more than to include him. was a great guy, even if a shit diver.
i wonder how many letters he's sent out during his presidency.
*ol mary todd's callin, so i guess it must be time for bed.*
that's something to show your grand-kids. "look at what the last president of the usa wrote to me, immediately before the empire was created!"
i do not agree with a lot of his policies, but god damn is this man a class act. so much respect.
european here so i guess my opinion doesn't matter, but i'll never understand the pure hatred so many people feel for obama. it seems like every single president ends up being disliked by the majority of people. lose-lose.
my husband got a letter last year! he got elected mayor of our small town. there...were many people on council that didn't want him to win. he had a very tough 1st month. i was watching a documentary about the pres writing letters, so i wrote a letter for him, figuring could use some encouragement. he got a letter back and was very excited.
if you want a free pass on this, invite the sitting president to your wedding. traditionally you're supposed to, and the president is supposed to respond. we tried it and it worked. got a signed letter of well wishes from bo himself.
cool letter. not cool that donald trump has suggested the possibility of opening all federal lands mentioned in the letter for drilling/fracking. relevant timing.
now, can you imagine trump reading 10 letters a day and writing a reply like that? me neither.
such a shame you fuckers replaced this learned man with someone's who bragged about grabbing women by the pussy and communicates through twitter and meme's.
cherish that shit. cherish that man. why america. why did we have to go from coolest cat in the galaxy to biggest blow hard car salesman ever!!! :'(
on the pod cast 99percent invisible he does a whole episode about obama and the letters he receive, "ten letters to the president"
8 years * 365.25 days each year * 10 letters each day = 29920. at least, for this type of letter.
why do americans resist free health care so much, doesn't make sense to me as a uk citizen. i know obamacare has flaws but surely it's a step in the right direction?
i am the best president that has ever presidented, nobody has been as good a president as me. all things i do are great and i am the humblest person to have ever walk the earth.
i feel like comparing trump to emperor palpatine is an insult to the empire. palpatine was far more capable than trump would ever dream to be.
it's nice to be able to disagree with someone on policy, but still be able to realize they are a good person.
can we in the uk swap him for theresa may? we'll throw in a free farage and boris to sweeten the deal.
as an aussie, when our last prime minister suggests that too many trees are 'locked up in nature reserve' and need to be 'freed', we knew he had to go
the national parks are one of the things about the us i'd be willing to die for. this makes me feel dread every time i hear it
i'm not a treehugger but i'll be damned if he opened the damn land for fracking. might as well disband nps and burn yellowstone to ashes, heck - strip mine it.
plus, that's just a stupid use of resources! the value of oil and natural gas has been falling all around the world, while the value of truly untouched land and clean water isr rapidly rising, and will continue to do so. experts claim the next generation's wars will be over water rights, not oil, so why contaminate millions of gallons and threaten the ground water for a less valuable resource?!
national parks are different. there are many federal lands which are not national parks. like most of nevada.
dear op, i'm glad that you like our parks. we have the best parks. our parks are so great. all these other countries, their parks are total disasters.
i'm sure donald trump cares so deeply about this country that he's going to ask for 11 letters each night.
this bot is awesome, i like this bot. shame, he forgot to mention he's a bot.
that's read not sent out. he also only reads when he is at white house not when away. so less than that but still probably more than others.
because we are conditioned to not like paying taxes. we are also very individualistic, and don't have a sense of sacrificing for public goods.
a simple answer: healthcare is a big industry and they have a strong lobby.
because we've been told by liars since we were children that nations like the u.k. have horrible healthcare systems and that we would all be put in death camps by baby killing socialists if we ever voted for nationalized healthcare.
you probably should black out the signature. don't want people to find out who this "president obama" guy is now do we.
we need an obama response letter generator online, so we all can feel good in times of need.
i expect there are a handful of generic letters that he touches up. i'm just happy the bleed through on the back shows its a real signature and not a print.
that is so cool! and looks like your dad also received a signed copy of the sotu address. thanks for sharing!!
fuck, i'm going to miss having a president who pauses to think instead of throwing rapid fire insults while thinking of ways to deflect the question.
there has been more than one empire, many of which weren't fictitious.
conversely, you can agree with someone's policies but think they are a total piece of shit! not that there's been anyone like that in recent memory...
well, he is black. and basically he is america's head coach. checks out.
i was just in a class where we did a three day ride in the backcountry of colorado. he spoke passionately as we looked over the beautiful land how all these trees being there are a waste and we need to strip them so we can not buy from russia. it was so hard to hold my tongue. we saw plenty of stripped land and it was awful.
the national parks are one of the things that we did perfectly right. i have never gone out of my way to protest. however, i would do anything in my absolute power to protect the national parks. they are truly one of the greatest things our country has done as a nation and to watch them be privatized or stripped of natural resources/wildlife disturbed is just not something i can stand for.
yellowstone is already kind of burning from beneath, and someday it will turn us all in to ashes.
somehow i've never asked this before, but where the fuck did he pick up his speech patterns? new yorkers don't talk like that. who talks like that?
"just read a letter from some idiot complaining about me. sad!!!"
"oh boy. it's a letter from the white house. i bet president trump got my message!" "hmm. it just says wrong in big bold letters..."
he'll supplement 6 of them for late-night twitter responses.
no, he'll read just one. but it will be the yugest most terrific one, bigly.
ops photo, is it actually him writing or did someone else write it, he approved it/signed it and sent via post office?
"i'm not on fire, why should *i* pay for the fire service?"
i'm from the uk too so forgive my ignorance but aren't you paying the same (or more) as insurance?
my argument is that there are two types of americans: taxpayers and citizens. taxpayers understand they have to pay taxes and begrudgingly do it, always hoping for their taxes to be lowered and voting for candidates who will do that for them. then there are citizens, people who are okay paying taxes and even a little more sometimes if it means better lives for everyone overall. i consider myself the latter. i am fine with paying higher taxes if it means people get health care, better education, and our infrastructure improves (just a few examples.)
i swear when i went to the states last time some of the people i talked to down in florida would rather pay $20,000 a year to have health care than pay $10,000 in taxes if it means that some poor person somewhere gets their healthcare for free.
this. recently, went through orientation with my new company. there were 12 of us, truck drivers, in class. we started talking about benefits and most of the guys didn't know they couldn't be denied for preexisting conditions. they hated on obama and the aca. then were surprised to find out they were benefiting from his work in office.
the most surreal argument i was ever in, as a canadian, was with my american right-wing ex-in laws as they argued with me about canadian health care. "you don't have regular doctors, you can only go to the er!" i have a doctor and i saw him like two weeks ago "no you didn't. and the government won't give surgeries or treatment to old people so that they die because it's cheaper" my dad is 74 and just had a very successful heart valve replacement surgery, he was scheduled in swiftly because they wanted to deal with it before the weakened valve became a real threat to his health. now he's in a fully-funded cardiac rehab fitness program as part of his recovery "you're lying. and you have to beg the government to approve your medical treatment" uhhhhhhh that's just... not true, and i don't even know what to say to that "yes it is, i heard it on fox."
guys i did some serious hacking and found out his address, it's 1600 pennsylvania ave., washington dc
you're the first person to ask me that. :) i did not support him as president and told him i was disappointed when he was elected. i went on to say that as the years have gone on i gained respect for him and i'm now proud that he was/is our president. (this is from memory). i had just gotten back from an amazing trip in the smoky mountains, saw our two options for president, saw he named a national monument in maine, saw he was getting heat for it and felt patriotic. thus, the letter i sent. :)
after looking at them he thinks the letter is signed by the president and the sotu address is auto penned. i guess he did a little research into it. i hadn't seen another letter from the president before this post but you can see the signatures are closer between the signed letters and the sotu looks a bit different.
i'm going to miss having a president that is uber intelligent and can actually form a sentence.
he doesn't pause to think, he pauses because it is a beneficial speech tactic. i'm quite sure he already knows what he wants to say before he gets to a mic to say it.
"i never said i read a letter from an idiot complaining about me. that never happened." [deletes original tweet 3 hours later]
obama offers notes in the column on what he wants to say back and writers who know his diction and voice actually write the letter but it is obamas thoughts.
if this is interesting to you, you should totes check out that 99% invisible podcast, it was really good. the podcast said that while he does occasionally do a full letter response, most of the time he runs off the highlights, one of his peeps writes it up in his voice, and he approves it. they talk about how by the end of the 8 years, these people who write the letters usually match him pretty well.
these lazy people just want handouts! they should pull themselves out of the fire by their bootstraps!
same. i don't have children but i don't mind my taxes going to schools because i don't want america to be filled with stupid(er) people.
i'm with you on this. increased public health standards and accessible education have a direct correlation to lower crime and other issues that affect us all. why would we not want that?
.. #1 issue in usa. misinformation. television has been primary tool for educating and informing a vast majority of the population. it has conditioned viewers to create opinion from emotion. nothing on tv can be taken at face value, there is always an opinion being pushed like a drug, get hooked and spread that opinion with group think, hit the right people (head of household) and it will proliferate. after 50 years of practice it is soo easy to manufacture opinion it should scare this crap outta everyone. it should be regulated, but we call it marketing and its ok to market everything from apples to racism. the hatred of government and taxes only helps wealthy people.. problems in the us are really not that complicated, people just dont know what they need to and now anyone on tv is an expert and a headline is a repeatable opinion.
there's millions of people in the us who believe exactly what your family does so that's why we have terrible healthcare .
i like that denial of you seeing a doctor. "you didn't *actually* see a doctor, that goes against my argument!"
jesus! enough with your doxing dude, are you that 4chan guy?
that cant be right, is he moving or something? i was on apartments.com and saw new lease was signed nov 7th? moving in jan 20th, apparently hotel owner next door rented it so he can keep close look on his business
i really appreciate you saying this. these days it seems like if you don't agree with someone politically, you just yell the craziest insults or disparage them personally. i like that even though you didn't agree with him, you're not spewing vitriol, *and* can give him credit for things he's done that you did agree with. more people should follow your example.
that is understandable since i'm sure there are many copies of the sotu printed out.
i'm going to miss being certain that the u.s. president won't start a nuclear war tomorrow.
"the president tried to start a flame war with me in the comments of a youtube video about rednecks falling off atvs"
kind of reminds me of the the hateful 8 and the whole backstory of samuel l's character having a note from abraham lincoln.
i wrote a letter to the wh and got a response back in the same format - three paragraphs, last one ending with "again, thank you for your thoughtful letter." so there's some sort of template they use and the pres maybe signs a few each day, the rest are an autopen or printed signature.
also, most of the time, he makes so many margin notes that he might as well have written it himself.
well, i don't know which (republican) asshole decided to spin off fire service into a non-tax fee just to say that taxes were lowered, but i have limited sympathy for the homeowner here as well. if everyone quote-unquote "forgets" to pay for fire service until their home is literally on fire, there is no fire service. or each individual call costs 10 grand, take your pick.
the whole "no abortion" thing makes no sense. no one *wants* to have an abortion. but for a second lets put aside the "i got knocked up and i don't want to have a kid" argument for a second. i have a friend who about midway or so into her pregnancy found out that her fetus never actually developed a brain, most of the head never developed. i couldn't possibly imagine her having to carry that dead fetus another 2-3 months knowing it had zero chance of survival. i wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. religion's influence over public policy does nothing positive for citizens as a whole. all it does is divide and oppress.
republicans seem to be implicitly *for* any measure which increases the uneducated population. can't afford that child? too bad, you'll just have to be poor and unable to send them to college.
this really is a great comment. i appreciate your dad. i work in policy and finance in local government in one of the most liberal bastions in america, and i absolutely see what he sees.
sounds like a great society to live in! i woke up one day at 5am with the worst pain in my life and i had no idea what it was i thought i was dying, a free trip to hospital revealed a kidney stone as the source of my problem. i am glad to live in australia and not be bankrupt from needing to go to the hospital when i thought i was dying of internal damage or something. i think its great that ***i live in a world where i can not fear needing to get help***.
there are many places where i disagree with the administration. that being said i have so much admiration for president obama, as a grown man he is one of my few heroes. in my lifetime i have never felt nostalgic for a president before he has left office, even before this election. now every time i see him all i want to do is give him a hug and say thank you sir. he is the best possible example of calm focused demeanor in the face of adversity.
not to toot my own horn here, but i called my senators yesterday to message about an issue. it felt really good to communicate with my political opponents at the highest level in a cordial, polite tone.
reading is knowledge. knowledge is power. but power corrupts. corruption is a crime, and crime doesn't pay. so if you keep reading, you're going to go broke! donald is a business man, after all, very rich. tremendously rich. so obviously, he doesn't read.
"that atv accident wasn't huge. your head is what's huge. how are you gonna get a hat to fit that thing?"
"the redditor! in the stable! has a letter from president obama!?!"
every writer uses a template. especially if you write a lot every day. you got to imagine that obama sends letters to a lot of folks not just replys to letters he receives
most of reddit can capture trumps tone pretty well, so theres that.
that was my favorite bit. i can image the margins filled with complete thoughts and his writers simply rewriting it and adding punctuation.
you should read the article before you try to make this political. the person lived outside of the town limits, so they couldn't tax them. they offered firefighting service to nearby rural residents, but since they can't forcibly tax people outside of the town, they give them an option to pay for the service. i'm guessing if there were any other rural residents that forgot to pay the annuity, this was a good reminder to do so.
education really is a long-term investment : more skilled workers, less poverty & unemployment, less crimes, more chances for one of us to come up with cool new innovations or some life-changing treatment, better leaders to manage our community. people who don't like paying for the education of others must think each person lives in their own personal bubble otherwise they'd understand how much we rely upon other people for ... pretty much everything i guess, even the people who taught *us* were taught by other people and the cost of our own education financed by other families, even if they hated it at the time.
well done! sadly i think most of the people who call and write to their reps are lunatics, which may explain the nature of today's discourse. reasonable people are more quiet and polite, unfortunately.
"i wrote a yuge response, using only the best words, and folks let me tell you....the wall just got 10ft higher" *thumbs up*
wrong! my style is so unique, i mean i have the best style. it's tremendous! -trump probably
add to the fact that getting an actually abortion isn't as simple and easy as conservatives would like you to believe. it's a miserable experience, with horrible recovery, and then something you are ashamed of for the rest of your life--whether it's 'justified' or not.
sometimes i feel like people recording stuff with their phones tend to think that they're watching a video and not actually filming it...
those people really underestimated how much flying ice was about to hit their faces.
why the heck was it *not* throwing snow until it was halfway down the platform? did they clean half the track beforehand and just say fuckit?
as a german, i'm very irritated by the seeming lack of personnel in charge of keeping the tracks free of ice. it's so unsafe!
how most people will die in the future... watching their impending doom through the camera lens of their fuckin' phone.
crowd-sourced cinema. looks like at least 4 people getting that shot from all angles.
did no one put two and two together and figure out what's going to happen when a train comes? jesus seems obvious to me
i live in australia and have never been in snow, so forgive me if this is a stupid question but: what the fuck did they think was going to happen? i mean the snow isn't hidden, it's *right there* and it seems obvious that the snow is going to get rapidly displaced when the train arrives. did they think it was just going to get squished down small or something?
they had like 10 seconds to respond and run. maybe even longer depending on how slow their internet connection was.
i assume they were picturing a bit of fluffy nothingness hitting them. silly city dwellers.
actually, no, having been on this line (hudson line in ny it seems from where the tracks are in relation to the river behind it) usually amtrak trains slow down as they go through the station specifically because of shit like this. this train was going way too fast for winter weather conditions and going through a station.
is there a version of it that doesn't have the volume muted or video slowed down?
you can see a handful of smart (or experienced) people getting the fuck out of the way.
the platform could form a spot for the snow to drift.
as an englishman, i agree! i'm also irritated that there was no personnel there to stop people from going to the platform.
why do you think they're filming? jesus, seemed obvious to me.
looked like they all had their phones out. self publication will be the death of us.
they were thinking falling snow, which is soft and gentle as it covers stuff in a layer of fluff. they were not thinking of how much accumulated snow weighs, or how it gets squished into basically ice as the weight of the snow above it compresses it. i'm sure you've seen people knocked over by waves? same idea. they think it'll be like in the shower or it'll be misty or something. had a cousin do a full faceplant in the sand because he didn't brace for a wave on the beach.
people are stupid, stupid animals. never forget that.
it's like people driving through a flooded road not realizing how powerful rushing water is.
are there a lot more instances of this happening out in the country? do you non-city people have a lot of snow-filled commuter train platforms?
as a former city dweller, i'd actually argue many of us know more about being outside in the elements (commuted without a car for 9 years). certainly more than the average suburbanite.
that was the weirdest ducking movie i've ever watched.
nonsense; the steel beam's gonna be fine. no jet fuel in sight.
trains give the fewest fucks out of all modes of transport. choo choo coming through
i wanna accuse white beanie and the little girl of having zero reaction, but i don't think they had any time to move.
another video ruined by slow mo. when will people learn!
sure there was when the train was half a mile away.
there was plenty of time for them to predict that was going to happen.
i want a shot of the conductor in the train laughing his butt off.
or hiking in the summer desert with 500 ml of water.
i'm super surprised they let a train go onto that platform. people are idiots... but the people who run all this should know better (and be more afraid of lawsuits) than to let this happen. either that platform was supposed to be plowed and no one bothered to check (someone's going on probation) or someone messed up the train roster.
as a kid from a rural area, i consider suburbs as part of the city...
can i just say, that's a column, not a beam. beams are horizontal structural members. source: am structural engineer
commercial trains in canada are almost always that long. the railways span a very long distance, so they use as many wagons as possible.
she had way *too* much time to react. why would you stand that close when you obviously see a fuck ton of snow on the tracks?
also why did they decide to hit stop in the middle of being covered in snow?
perhaps the more exposed portions of track before the platform lost some snow as it was blown off by wind/melted under the sun. where as the snow on the portion of track by the platform had a bit more protection from the aforementioned elements.
met a couple on a 14,000 foot mountain in colorado a few summers ago who were severely dehydrated, had second degree sunburns, and were in need of a rescue. they went out to the wilderness with no water, no packs at all, and were wearing flip flops. the lady looked like she was going to die, and we gave them a few liters of water to rehydrate with (lucky for them we had enough, and a filtration system at base camp) and i radioed the nps ranger to get them some help. blew my mind how careless and dangerous people will be with their lives.
it's most likely amtrak's fault; amtrak shares rails with the ny metro lines and amtrak, always scared they'll be late because they're always late, ignores a lot of the regulations in place especially when it comes to things like speed while going through a station. trains are supposed to slow down, but many amtrak trains don't since they just don't give a fuck and fly through. it's an issue year round, but definitely worse in winter weather conditions like this.
and this is why engineers aren't welcome at parties. :(
she's recording it. just like the person that recorded the video we all just watched.
you're right. the 1st time i watched the longer video was on my phone. i just watched on a bigger screen. she had time to move. i wonder if she's reading something on her phone or if she has video too?
plot twist, the husband rehydrated a lot right before the hike and took a large life insurance policy on his wife out beforehand
i'm surprised they're allowed to drive through snowed-over stations. enough snow, especially when it gets compacted or does the fun melt/freeze thing that turns it a nearly solid block of ice, must be a potential hazard to the train, too.
it's not really to do with the orientation of the member, but how it's loaded. beams are generally loaded in bending (i.e. most of the load is applied across the length of it), whereas columns are axially loaded, so the load is applied to its ends. this is how beams are often horizontal and columns vertical because many loads act downwards due to gravity. obviously, that's a very simple analogy, there are more complicated structures depending on how they are loaded, what their geometry is, what their purpose etc.
you've clearly never been to a party full of engineers; they're the best!
i like how the pickup in the background just starts reversing immediately once the one crossing the water starts to flip.
live leak videos are the ones where they died right?
said the engineering student. the graduates aren't at the parties.
not every single one, but if you think someone should have died, and you saw it on liveleak, then yea, they probably died.
sometimes, it's hard to tell when you can't see their shoes though.
i don't know if that's a rule but i'd bet money that that guy died
wow that's even more ridiculous. i guess i thought long's because that's in a national park (sneffels is actually national forest, slight difference there between nps and usfs) - and because long's is notorious for people trying to do it with little to no preparation or experience.
seriously i think people misunderstand how little they care about things like this haha
"well there's your problem! you didn't go fast enough. let me show ya how its done. here, hold my beer."
probably gonna go switch to his bigger wheels, maybe jack it up a few more inches.
i saw this video of a guy on a moped get crushed by a semi truck. he exploded like a watermelon. is he dead too?
when you can't see their shoes they ded. even if they shoes are obscured by their motor vehicle.
a traveling job that sucks like all the rest. until 50 years ago most railroad workers stayed half drunk at work to tolerate it. now you are supposed to pretend to enjoy it. zero fucks given.
fun part is if you tell the police. they'll have a plain clothes officer scout the atm and wait for whoever put it there to come back and get it. karma's a bitch.
i work in a bank in chicago and you'll be surprised how often one of these skimming devices are added to our atms!! it's really shocking! always wiggle the thing that you insert your card in and try not to use the atm on sunday's. they usually install them saturday after work so they know no one is checking them and remove them monday early morning when we check them!
what would you say is the proper amount of wiggle one should give an atm?
i protect myself from credit card fraud by ensuring i always have a negative balance! works every time!
that green thing on the atm was made to protect from skimmers. looks like not only it fails to do it, but seed false confidence in people that atm is protected from skimmers. great that op don't fall for it.
i legitimately thought this was a joke till i found one in my neighborhood. i would have never known as well if not for reddit lol.
i was waiting in line in customer service at are grocery store and a girl was talking to another employee and said "oh we have to check the atm now, it's been an hour. come over here and i'll show you how". she then started showing her how to wiggle all the parts and make sure they are all legit atm parts. comforting that they check and every hour.
with all the scummy people hidden in the corners of reddit, you know there is at least one guy who makes a living installing these and he is getting really upset that people are becoming more aware of his scam.....
i'm so paranoid about this myself, any time i've come up to an atm now i try to tear it apart to see if any part is fake lol.
don't call the cops, cut the battery cable and wait for the thrives to come and check it out. then break their legs.
there's an atm at the building where i work that is covered in those new electronic tamper evident tags along all the cracks where the card reader is. if a single one gets ripped off without the scanner thingy, it triggers a failsafe and shuts down the atm. the building admins get an email and a snapshot from the atm's camera from the security firm that installs them. it's nifty as hell. so far nothing has triggered it but im honestly wishing someone would try just to see some sweet justice unfold.
i used to do this all the time, until one day i broke a legitimate atm card reader and nearly got charged with vandalism until the police officer tested out how hard it is to break on the machine next to the one i used, and off popped a card skimmer that was placed on the atm next to mine.
wow!! that's crafty!! wonder how many used it before you did, without noticing?
i did found one once at a 7 eleven right by the cashier. he told me i broke it soon as i did it. "why are you breaking my card reader" 'thats a skimmer, watch your original card reader will still read my card just fine' "yeah but its broken now thats not supposed to come off" 'look at the card reader does it look like anything is not there' "yeah but that piece was apart of it" this is about the time i facepalmed (not for real tho, just internally). told him to go call the cops or get his manager and if i truly broke it i would pay for it.
okay from now on i'm gonna shake anything with a slot.
and that's why the chip was added to the cc. it's makes skimming harder as it needs to sit in the atm to work.
great now i'm going to be paranoid for the rest of my life.
make sure you report that to the bank so they can do an audit of who used their cards in that atm and take precautionary steps.
this kinda shit really pisses me off. wtf is wrong with these people that they think it's ok to steal other people's money? i just don't get it.
ok so here's an idea. atm manufacturers could start making a card reader slot surface thing that would have a few motorized pins on them. every so often these pins would pop out of the surface to remove or detect and obstruction.
the fact that these things even exist makes me truly hate humanity. we can't have anything good without some evil scheming asshole ruining it for everybody.
wow! my skimmer made it onto reddit! hey op, can i get that back?
how is the data retrieved from this? can it be done wirelessly? the circuit doesn't look complex enough for something like that. it seems like it would be ballsy as hell to go back and retrieve this so you could wire it up to access the ram.
for folks who have found a skimmer, what do you do with it afterwards? throw it away? give to the business where the atm is? give to authorities/police directly? are these more commonly found on stand alone atms or atms within businesses?
i'm confident that the first time i find one, the plainclothes officer will be there to arrest me.
the new skimmers don't even need retrieval, drive/walk by with a ipad and download via bluetooth or wi-fi
i imagine you don't want to leave the skimmer in case the thief comes to grab it while you're gone, and if you take the skimmer with you, the cops might accuse you. so do you call 911?
reason #749 why banks being closed on the weekends makes no sense. /bitter guy who gets paid on fridays who is fed up with not being able to access his money until wednesday morning because the bank isn't open until monday, but they process everything deposited on monday, on tuesday morning, and require 24hrs before funds become available.
can someone explain what happens when they get your info? are they depleting your account immediately, or is this a more long term scam where they are taking small amounts over a longer period of time?
there is red tape on all four corners of respectable gas pumps that read..."alert store if tampered with"
oh god.. now i have to even be careful of gas station pumps? how would i check?
shake it once, that's fine shake it twice, that's okay shake it three times, you're playing with yourself
that would just mean the scammer could max out your card + whatever negative balance on the account. it's a better plan to just keep your cc maxed and ur bank acct empty
exactly, why not just make the face completely flat with a flush slot in it, then any protrusion would be immediately obvious.
put a gps-transmitter in it and wait. then get the cops involved.
wonder how many were found that caused them to implement that policy. that the the less comforting part.
i work at a gas station. most gas stations have tamper proof tape on the pumps to show if anyone's opened them and put in a skimmer. but now we have a new system where if the door is opened without a switch inside being flipped the whole pumps shut off. it's awesome not having to check them three times a day.
better drill all the way into the interior and check the cash-dispensing mechanism, just to be sure.
some banks offer a cardless cash withdrawal alternative. you use their app to get a code (valid for a few days, can be used only once), go to an atm, and use that code to get your money. still not 100% safe, but at least your card is not cloned (and the compromised amount is less than what you have in your account, plus the codes can only be used in atms).
wait for the next person that tries to wiggle it like they know it should come off then beat the shit outta them...
does a huge steel door slam down cutting off the hands or fingers of the person who was using it? one can only hope.
po: "it's bad to break stuff" op: "stuff was easy to break..." po: "hmm... should we try break the other stuff to see if ez to break?" po: "other stuff was apparently virus stuff. you free to go."
see you people and your fancy plastic cards are going to get screwed by identity theft. that's why i only use old world currency like livestock and hookers.
wow so they just get sold like that? and i'm actually surprised by the price
he's fitted the hardware you linked to onto what looks like an oem cover from the actual atm manufacturer. looks like they stack like solo cups. not a good design. the only way i see this eventually evening out is to implement near-field rfid with two (or three!) step authentication before you can actually access funds. that makes your credit card account number about as useful as your phone number, with no need to protect it. you just need to remember your favorite pet's name and where your grandmother went to high school or whatever.
maybe he's the person who installed the skimmer... or maybe he's clueless. hard to know for sure
i keep multiple fingers poised over the buttons and enter digits like this. my hope is that someone who's watching can't tell which numbers i'm actually pressing...
honest question, even if i have a chip on my card, isn't the skimmer still getting my info from the magnetic strip anyway? for all the places in the us where you see the sign 'no chip', the magnetic strip works fine.
yeah the most recent credit card fraud i've experienced was after i used my card at a gas station in the middle of nowhere tx. someone promptly bought $700 worth of electronics from a store in nebraska a few hours later. i know it was that gas pump because i was camping that weekend and that's the only credit card purchase i made for days.
some of the more advanced ones use bluetooth. gas pumps and self-checkout lanes in grocery stores are big targets for these.
step 1: walk up to atm step 2: remove skimmer, place in pocket, walk away step 3: profit
good ol' plainclothes, always on the lookout for thieves such as u/geethekid.
do _not_ take it. the owner might be nearby watching it and they'll be pretty unhappy with you.
no direct deposit option available where you are?
unfortunately, it is rather common to see security tape placed in ways where it is not activated if the covered is opened.
i pre-pay now because of this. so does the rest of the office.
complete disassembly. it's the only way to be sure
shake it once your fine. shake it two times your playing with it.
somewhere in redditland of about a year ago there's actually a video of the very specific green skimmer/atm model in this post and the guy discovering it and removing it on video.
that looks like a bank interior. how the hell does a couple of guys even install such a complicated piece of hardware without anyone noticing? i mean, maybe this was done overnight, they had access and they were agile, but surely they would think the bank cameras would catch them? still, scammers who go those *insane* lenghts would surely have thought of that. i'm just dumbfucked. have any source on that?
my brother worked at a large box store and it was an issue. they would check, not sure how often but the would. he also said some crooks were really good and could swap out a reader in a minute.
the 24hr gas station i worked at required us to check it every 8hrs at the pumps. i've never found one and i've been checking every card reader i've used since
why are they still making these machines with massive pieces sticking out the front. why aren't the card readers completely flush so it would be obvious if someone added something?
great idea.... come along with me to watch out to make sure no hackers or scammers watch me in the process
seems like it would just be smarter to switch to the chip and pin cards that the rest of the world has been doing for a long time.
i got to help the police break into a store one time! i don't know if she was in the bathroom when they closed or something, but an old lady got locked in a store next to where i worked. the doors weren't able to be unlocked from the inside and the lady was really starting to get upset. my manager let me stay outside by the doors with her until the police showed up. cops tried to figure out how to get ahold of an owner or manager for like five minutes, then just said fuck it lets break in. it is surprisingly easy to rip open automatic doors when you've got 4 cops helping and a crying 80+ year old woman on the other side. . they seriously just kinda slid the doors back together and propped them up against each other and left.
"ok crystal, just run your nipple through this strip reader..."
magnetic stripe isn't necessarily only used for credit cards, any shitty badge at any job could have a mag stripe used to open certain doors. this is one of the major reasons behind the drive to the chipped cards because of how non-secure the magstripe is.
probably both. somebody told him "i'll give you $50 to put this on the atm at your work"
the payment networks really need to put a stop to this. if the terminal supports reading chips, it should refuse any card that has a chip if they swipe it. period. set a deadline, force the companies to fix their garbage. i'm so tired of seeing perfectly good chip readers with a ":) no chip please swipe (:" card stuck in them.
yes, but that cloned card could be useless at any merchant that accepts chip cards. still ignores the fact many don't.
i understand that. i didn't see any header pins on the circuit, just wondering how it's connected to the computer.
what are they going to do? tell the cops i stole their skimmer?
it just depends on where you work. some places offer it, others don't. neither of my roommates are offered direct deposit. they work in a fairly nice restaurant in southern ca. we've had to pay late fees on rent because they get paid on friday and it takes so damn long for the bank to process the check.
yeah, police in my city have started a program because the pumps here have been hit hard. they said there are basically 2 universal keys that open nearly every pump. the police have create their own unique tape/sticker that gas stations can opt into. i think they have to check their pumps in the morning and the police will check too.
not to sound stupid... but, how does pre-pay for gas work??
bank - "sir, can you please stop swinging that sledgehammer at our atm?" me - "i won't be scammed"
maybe they did, but thought they were professionals. if i saw someone come and place that, i'd maybe think they were replacing something.
if you built a perfectly functioning atm replica, and managed to install it onto the front of a real atm, without being seen, or without it looking conpletely obvious it was modified, you deserve all 14 dollars in my bank account
wow i can't help but think the effort they put into making these elaborate schemes would be better served making money legally.
these are getting impossibly difficult to spot. how will we as consumers continue to stay ahead of it?
did they have you open the front panels and look inside? all the skimmers being found around here now are actually placed *inside* the machines, as the criminals apparently now all have copies of the keys to open them up. there was surveillance footage on the news of how they'd do it. park a big van in front of the pump, obscuring it from view inside. one person would go inside to make a distraction while the other would unlock the pump's front panel, quickly stick the skimmer chip next to the card slot with double-sided tape, and then button everything back up. it's all bluetooth now, so they don't even have to come collect them anymore, just park nearby and sync the data. they said the battery pack attached would be good for up to six months. as busy as the stations around here are, that's a *lot* of stolen cards.
i'm no expert, but i can imagine the slot itself would get expansions or scam readers inserted. every obstacle you add to deter theft has a countermeasure for a thief to exploit.
next thing you know you'd have us switching to the metric system. crazy talk.
it's legally required in most places that doors can always be opened from the inside. an alarm may be installed for it happening after hours or a specific emergency exit. those push bar handles on the inside are for that. if a fire started somehow, she could've died, even.
of course, the linked msr010 doesn't even support that, all it can do is read swipes, store a few thousand encrypted, and then download the data the data via usb later. it's totally for card skimming
top left of the skimmer in the image is a micro sd card socket, just left of the battery. pull off skimmer. swap card. replace skimmer. take card home and read it.
i work for a bank in the u.k. and reading things like this is amazing. your banking system sounds so old fashioned and dreadful. we get paid instantly straight into our accounts on the same day every month or week. banks are open monday - saturday. you can bank online and transfer between your accounts and send money to other people. you don't get charged for withdrawals. there's no minimum balance requirement or time it has to be in there.. it finally seems like we're winning at something for a change!
cheaper and more effective to replace the pump locks with unique keys held in the store, or bolt-on padlocks.
but sir. here at suntrust, we are the ones out to scam you. destroying a single atm is like capturing a single pawn on the chess board.
pull back your bow (you do have a bow right) unless you are some kind of girly man or something you should have it set at around 70-75lbs, pull with about 1/3 that amount of force on the atm.
as someone who serviced atm in public places, nobody cares what you are doing.
go in dressed as maintenance and act like you're supposed to be there. that's the key to life and theft.
these are professionally made though. they even have a serial number on them. most people who build these will just buy a regular atm and make it fit perfectly. so i think you are giving them too much credit. it would be amazing if they built these without having access to original atm, then yeah that would be pretty nicely done.
i suspect they make a pretty substantial amount of money illegally.
keys are notoriously insecure. there was a talk at a recent defcon about elevators, but they showed how the elevator panel keys are all mastered across entire regions of the country, and in some cases, high definition images of the keyed masters are available online, ripe for the taking. it doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to expand that possible vulnerability to any other small keyed lock system.
which is why i'm surprised retailers aren't pushing mobile payments (nfc based stuff like android, samsung and apple pay) more. everything i have read has them being way more secure in almost every way.
do you fellas need a ride? we can take my van. you guys won't be able to see though, since the windows are painted over.
i'll act as a decoy and distract the staff while you guys work. otherwise they might spot you and wrongly assume you're up to no good.
interesting i didn't realize that actually but yeah when you say that there is little legitimate use for it :p
we have that in america, too. direct deposit. the vast majority of banks will also usually have money from checks available immediately, even while they process them.
of course. the bow. my bow. its right here. my bow. just let me get it. the bow. the bow which is mine.
as someone who used to work for fedexkinkos (the shirts look like fedex shirts though) you can wear a fedex shirt, and carry a white box into just about anywhere. you just have to look like you really don't have time for this shit.
husband and i caught an atm thief at a local rodeo once, because we thought it was wierd the atm company would have a guy out at 8 am to take money -out- of the machine, surrounded by people, and dressed in a hoodie. no one even looked twice till my husband asked the guy for his company id and the guy bolted. he didn't get far, as the sherrif post was literally right outside the door he booked it out of, but still. no one thought twice about a guy in street clothes taking huge stacks of twenties out of an atm without any sort of security around him or anything.
i know right. i mean we all had jobs before lol. at some point there os a diminishing return at the workplace. a few skimmers in a metro area is much more cost efficient for their time.
hopefully you're telling the workers before you leave.
see the recent tsa master keys being plastered across the internet. anyone can make a copy of them and open practically any luggage no problem. you can even 3d print the keys. this is exactly what will happen to encryption if governments are allowed to enforce back doors. except as soon as the back doors are leaked in that case, the damage will be extremely wide spread, extremely fast, and far more harmful.
there was a few cases on the london underground recently where people would have small handheld nfc payment readers, and slowly shuffle up to people in crowds and subtly make transactions on their cards/phones. pretty sure it was just a proof-of-concept rather than a legitimate criminal operation, but it just goes to sure, nothing in this world is perfectly secure. e: didn't realise there was a security feature in the phones, maybe it was just contactless cards then?
also there's a mattress in the back, don't mind the cameras. that's where i do my fappin
this would require all merchants to accept chips, which is far from the case in the us.
oh double fuck. i just took money out of an nyc atm today.
only thing i can think of is buying drinks on an airplane.
especially payroll checks. they usually have a number printed on them for verification for the bank.
just imagine what it's like to lift a grain of rice and multiply that by 725,000.
oh, right. the poison. the poison for kuzco, the poison chosen especially to kill kuzco, kuzco's poison. that poison?
exactly. i participated in some white-collar crime a few years ago and it sure as hell beat any job i had. having to wake up at 5am and then go to work, doing shit that you hate for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for a $1,500 paycheck at the end of two weeks is a complete shit deal compared to spending like a week tops to cook up a scheme like this and then earning $10k a week. the tradeoff is the stability and risk of going to jail. criminals don't get guaranteed paydays, but when they do get paid, it is a ridiculous amount for the work.
wtf, i had no idea that pos terminal fake covers were a thing.
don't you have to have authenticated a purchase by pressing the home button to bring up apple pay / android pay, and using your fingerprint or password? it's not active for purchases otherwise.
idk how android pay works but apple pay requires a deliberate action and touch id.
oh this thing? thats just my semi automatic rifle. its to protect against the scammers. the bullets are also untraceable for protection
i don't understand. do cards in the us not have those sim-like chips on them?
thanks. i go to one in midtown west. still going to check it on the way home. edit - so, the atm had an "out of order" sign on it now. think i'll be keeping a close eye and possibly calling bank.
we are both wrong. i bamboozled the maths. it's actually 9449.84108333 almonds
in my defense, all your poisons look alike, you might want to think about relabeling some of them.
i read that as "piece of shit" rather than "point of sale" initially. i guess both technically work
i believe the man at the counter is his distraction. with the bags of chips blocking the clerk's view along with attracting so much attention to himself. they've certainly done this before.
android and samsung pay are the same, what he's referring to was the "tap to pay" credit cards that you'd touch to the kiosk. essentially someone just had to get close enough to trigger the chip in the credit card and it would transmit your card number back to the individual.
most cards issued within the past couple years have them, yes, but a lot of merchants still don't have the hardware/software to accept chips and require you to swipe your card.
"hmm why is that fireman destroying that atm with his axe?"
just wait until they make fake amazon stores. then i'm truly boned.
if there's footage of someone stealthily putting that on i'll be impressed.
wow, yours is so much better made. you should fist bump your sound guy, because your voice was super crisp and clear. better acted, better sound, more concise, and that whole mask thing was dumb as fuck. well done! sorry you got ripped off, but at least you know that you can outshine a much larger channel through straight up better film making.
this site won't load for me, as i assume all the clicks from here has killed it. can you post the two separate youtube links?
yours was so much better too. lot more care and better acted. hope this thread blows up for you. they didn't just take a piece here or there, it was shot by shot ripped off.
wow.. i remember seeing the original a ways back.. this is such a shameless ripoff and they didn't even try to get it right.. the acting stinks, the pacing is all off. the shots are timed poorly. and what the fuck is up with the finger guns from the guy dropping off the envelope? and on top of it it's a political piece? what the fuck!
they literally took your video and made it worse.. but yeah, h3h3 on twitter or something.
i remember watching yours a bit ago. i thought it was black mirror at first. also, yours is way better. fuck that girl and her boobs.
the best part about the clone? **i hope you guys like my stuff** that bitch
hit up h3h3, they like to help out people, especially since this would be an interesting controversy to handle, hope you get what you need good luck
hi op, your video is much better. i clicked into yours/the original and was expecting something boring (because i'm a negative nancy). instead i ended up sending it to a few buddies because i got a kick out of it. the other video is clumsy, awkward, and had i come across it organically i honestly wouldn't have gotten through the whole thing. i didn't get through it now, either. hope you find some modicum of justice. keep doing what you're doing.
i like that she took 25,000 to a billion lol. kind misses the point of the desperate state the person would be in. not sure what you can do except highlight it and maybe demand a link in her description. keep making videos you care about. people suck.
holy shit. i just went to the shit copied version and the comments lol. reddit is going to end her.
try messaging phillip defranco, he is always one to stick up for the smaller youtubers.
plot twist: op made both and increased views for both
everyone check out her imdb page under trademarks.
going to reply here since it's at the top currently - @op - you need to report their video. - click ---more then report - infringes on my rights that should lead you to another page where you can select "copyright infringement (someone copied my creation)" i'll admit i don't know how they handle this stuff, does something you create and upload automatically have a copyright? anyway that's probably the best thing you can do.
my god that video on the right looks fake as fuck, especially the acting. almost to the point where it was annoying. the video with the dude looks way genuine.
not to mention the horrible idea to use masks. loved that it was an actual person in the original. seemed more real
liked original video, disliked ripoff. screw those jerks.
if you watch the entire thing, the big twist is the guy with the finger guns was trump!!! what a twist.
seriously. the original was awesome. i remember seeing it when it came out and laughed my ass off. the rip off is just god awful, the cleavage isn't even worth it, and it's just a flat, un-funny video. i'm not even sure how you can take something so funny to begin with, and make it that unwatchable.
i like when they say a movie is inspired by a true story. that's kind of silly. "hey, mitch, did you hear that story about that lady who drove her car into the lake with her kids and they all drowned?" "yeah, i did, and you know what - that inspires me to write a movie about a gorilla!"
send me a check for $1,000,000 and i'll take care of the problem with more views.
right? it greatly annoyed me that they used a handwritten check with $1 million dollars on it. then she doesn't know it was from trump until she gets the note, but then it flashes back to her seeing trump at the end. original video was acted and produced so much better from start to finish.
right? there's definitely way less cleavage in our version. maybe that's what we're missing...
yeah, this seems like something h3h3 would definitely enjoy talking about.
yeah fupa was created for this exact type of situation. /u/erkdaclerk you should email them and also get in touch with u/videogameattorney
i met hila and ethan from h3h3 the other week. cool people.
she doesn't even act it out well. the original guy at least looks disheveled. she looks like she just stepped out of her makeup trailer.
it looks like a million, but the rest of your points stands
she literally just did it just now... saw the video, went back here and came back to youtube because i wanted to se how many views it got.. blam. "this video is not available youtube"
phillyd would be a good call for something like this.
whoa whoa whoa.... when did /u/pitchforkemporium/ get an assistant?
this is insane. it's 750,000 views on youtube, about $1,500 at best. a consultation with an ip lawyer will cost upwards of $1,000 alone. it wouldn't be worth trying to get a settlement over, let alone going to court. this guy's best bet is to have the chick apologize and link his channel so he gets more views, not legal action.
can confirm, he actually is tyler falbo. but really, there's a little tyler falbo in all of us.
copyright exists at the moment an original expression of an idea is transfixed to a medium that may be observed or reproduced. in other words, forget youtube itself being the determination of whether a copyright exists, the moment you put this on your hard drive to upload to youtube you have a copyright. hell, the moment you shoot the video and have it on a memory thingie-disk-thing copyright exists. ial.
the icing on the cake (end of video): "i hope you guys like *my* stuff..."
the comments on the ripoff are one of the few times i'll endorse the youtube comment section.
holy crap what a terrible rip off too. the original is so good and hers is just mediocre.
the original video was lacking tits, no wonder it got less views
and the terrible idea to use clinton. a relatively unknown politician makes the whole story more plausible. besides that, a million dollar payoff? no reasonable person would believe it. why not a gazillion dollar payout? bad acting, bad writing, bad shooting. the whole ripoff video was like watching a middle school remake of a hollywood movie.
disliking is interaction, it's the same as liking a video.
i know right? definitely didn't see it coming after the target was hillary clinton and the check said donald trump and that you can see him when the envelop is dropped off and the message says make america great again. but apart from all that, totally fresh and unexpected.
all the shameless cleavage too, this is just awful youtube bait. hell, even their hilary "impersonator" has a huge rack and a red low cut dress...
oh so the new one is another "hurr durr fuck trump" video? glad i skipped it then.
their version also takes advantage of tying in politics. other than that, your original is much better made. theirs was longer for no apparent reason. and yours seemed more "real" compared to theirs, which felt like some weird joke.
cleavage is the crutch of all second rate youtubers. you don't need to sink that low.
didn't that guy partner up with a lawyer to start a thing specifically for helping people against these types of bullshit? it sounds perfect for this.
happy to help. shoot me an email :) not really a fupa issue, but we still will take care of ya!
fupa was created to help fraudulent copyright claims. this would be a *real* copyright claim. kind of different than fupa, but sure. side note: can anyone post the two videos in the comments instead of the youtubedoubler site? doesn't work for me.
and her video didn't make any sense. she killed clinton - woo, fantastic. it was ordered by trump. oh, fuck, that changes everything! it was basically dumbed down version with worse acting, worse camera, worse lighting. but, yeah, it has boobs.
i swear i'm half deaf. or my hearing goes in and out. thanks for the correction.
this is the right answer. there is no way there is enough money at stake here to take this to court, especially given that the chances of winning are not high.
i agree. i'm not sure how it would be classed, probably as the script, but the cinematographic composition was definitely pulled from tyler's.
i feel blue balled, because i was eagerly waiting to hear what type of bullshit explanation she was going to put out for that...
good on you op for confirming /u/youknowit36 is tyler falbo. however, it's far too late. we are all tyler falbo. we are one. (brought to you by tyler falbo)
they recorded all the audio again after the fact in a studio so it was clearer. sometimes it's easier to do than to try to get good audio on set.
so much off camera dialogue. whoever shot the ripoff should never touch a camera.
hell, the copy doesn't even make sense without seeing the original. the copycat director didn't pay attention to the body language cues of lucas; the boobs can only sell so much. i hope this guy gets some justice, but in the meanwhiles i can sub him and dislike the other twat's video
because the guy can actually act rather than relying on boobs to hold your attention in the opening scene.
by a lot! the original was funny all the way. the ripoff only shows a latina mila kunis with extra boobs (bouncing boobs, which is fine).
the ripoff makes no sense. whom did she think assassination of clinton would help? like how is that a 'fuuuuuuuuuuck' moment? she had to see the 'make america great again' card to realize she was helping trump? the entire punchline of the gag relies on finding out who sponsored the hit after the fact.
and "this is behind the scenes of my *second* official youtube video..." i wonder who else she ripped off?
that would be the cherry on top. the icing is applied to the cake at the 6th second with "a creation by inanna sarkis". what a nasty thing to do.
it's funny because at the beginning of the video i thought they clearly just put this girl in it for the cleavage and this poor girl has no idea she's in a stolen video. then i watched till the end.
"when hitler thinks your a scumbag" was my personal favorite.
not even mediocre. it's straight up terrible. it is so full of itself it makes me sick.
nah it's a poor ripoff, the people who did it are pieces of shit.
the only reason it has more views is because of the election, the person who copied it probably thought, "how can i cash in on youtube and make a video with a lot of views, i know since i am not original i'll rip off this video with few views and put clinton in the title along with other popular key words like donald trump and reap the real karma, cash when it blows up just from keywords and not content. " bout as bad as those iphone 8 videos which are bullshit.
that's completely false. dislikes affect youtube's search algorithms and are extremely important to a video's reach.
i think i remember he said there were also a few burglaries in the area.
there is no "regulation" regarding what you say to promote a movie, you could say in your trailer that the lord of the rings is based on a true story and no one could stop you. i've had to point this out several times in regards to horror movies.
which makes theirs flavor of the month and the original timeless.
what is the copyright claim? the videos aren't actually the same.
no need to be mean, dude. i was offering up my only pitchfork. i don't have the resources to handle the kind of overhead that /r/pitchforkemporium is dealing with.
how did you make so many accounts with such rich comment history so fast for this??? dayum son
it's a bitch to match everything up though, need to have some pretty good actors that can say the exact same line in the exact same way or it'll look weird.
thing is, this could be written off as a parody in order to avoid such claims (due to the donald/hillary change it can be seen as a parody or commentary of the original video). don't know much about this type of stuff, but i've watched quite a few videos regarding it, so don't take my reply by the book. just a thought. (it would probably still be taken down because the blatant copying for like, 90% of the video)
she was a famous viner so her talent can only last 6 seconds.
i mean from the first scene, they pretty much made it about her boobs. it's not subtle.
plus there's the fact that it flat-out misunderstands what the original was trying to do. the political commentary is not the point. the political commentary is the setup to the joke and has an element of surprise that makes the payoff so much better. yet the remake is *all* about the political commentary and absolutely abandons any semblance of subtlety in the process.
i cant believe how noone here has brought up how racist the ripoff was! a shirtless stereotypical mexican working on her lawn? and for god's sake she had a black slave, wearing jeans and a straw hat, feeding her!!
that, and being a viner, with other popular viner friends to play small parts in the video to promote to the masses of teens who follow them.
think its the opposite, honestly. if i see a video with even a 1:1 like dislike ratio i'd probably watch it just to see why people got so mad.
i'm being overly simplistic. if you read the imdb the full story is when he was a kid a stranger knocked on his door and asked for someone that didn't live there. the guy left. he later found that some houses were robbed later. doesn't say whether or not that was the culprit.
i mean, its really only relevant as long as isis is, or its in peoples minds. so while not "timeless" it certainly has a longer lifespan.
big corporate america trying to keep the little rioters down.
which is interesting, because it seems no one realized that it was dubbed until the creator mentioned it (i certainly didn't).
they took the original, wrecked the pacing, and added cleavage, politics, and racist stereotypes. i can see why the creator of the ripoff is popular.
i think she was trying to change the angle to *make* it political commentary because idk i guess she felt less bad for stealing if she gave it her own twist. problem was that she absolutely cocked up her own twist and it ruined it
most likely it was the thief. we had a guy open the door to our office once and ask for a job application. it was a usaf office so we don't just hire people who walk in. later we found out "someone" took a bunch of laptops from another floor that had an open door.
yea, but they have rudolph pitchforks!!!!! {_} 3-= ____( _|/---_
now i've only done it once in a school project about 10 years back, there might be better software now and we were quite young. but i'd still say that you probably did a better job than we did. it was pretty obvious in our movie.
well, yes, it did. but it was just part of the overall poorer quality of her video when compared to the original. poor overall storytelling (she clearly saw that it was trump during the flashback, so why was she surprised when the "make america great" sticker appeared?) and overall piss poor cinematography, even for a youtube original. i mean, it's at a higher resolution though, so there's that!? also, cleavage.
yeah, basically vetting the neighborhood. like joe pesci in home alone when he's pretending to be the cop. i was just clarifying it wasn't fact and the writer was making a (likely) assumption. i've had someone random ask me if i was home alone, which is weird as fuck. i said no.
or heartbreaking when you see somebody downvoted who shares a similar opinion or mindset.
yes, rip-off. the only dif is hers has more cleavage. tbh that is probably why it has more views
more often than not people don't get downvoted by their opinion but by the way they express it. even if you are voicing a pretty normal opinion it's not surprising if you get downvoted for doing so unpolitely. half of what you say is how you say it.
dana boente is now acting attorney general, hes an obama appointee but apparently he'll defend the ban.
probably a good thing house of cards doesn't start until may. if it aired tomorrow it'll probably suck compared to real life.
being politically ignorant, i had to look up 'us attorney general' on wikipedia to find out what it means. the article currently says: "the office is currently held by groper-in-chief stooge dana boente, who cowardly assumed the office after the groper fired acting attorney general sally yates for courageously refusing to enforce or defend the groper's unconstitutional, racist muslim ban" that can't be right, can it? i also noticed that dana j. boente hyperlink leads to the wikipedia article for 'anus', and jeff sessions redirects to the fictional marvel character 'red skull'. it's all beyond me, but i thought people may be interested.
as someone who doesn't know what the attorney general does, is this bad?
very smart politics by sally yates. now she is a hero to the left, has 30 years experience and will be running for congress or the senate in 2 years mark my words.
it seems like the entirety of his presidency, length yet undetermined, will be conducted with the same level of insanity as the last week of nixon's tenure.
that whole volunteer mars mission where you'd have to leave earth and never be able to return is actually looking pretty awesome right now.
she's been fired for upholding the law in defiance of the leader. classic authoritarian move.
her being fired isn't the takeaway here; her position was temporary and her dismissal inevitable. what should scare the crap out of everyone regardless of your political views is that we're barely 10 days into someone's presidency and we're getting official press releases that sound like a supervillain from 1950s superman comics is delivering them.
so i take it that anyone who disagrees with him gets the boot? people who don't fall in line are immediately dismissed and promptly fired... that should scare the shit out of everyone. republican, democrat, doesn't matter. a president should be willing to listen to all of his advisors regardless of what side they are on... he's acting like a true business man and surrounding himself with yes men.
i have this theory that trump will be a kind of societal vaccination - all the trappings of a dictator without any of the competence or discipline to be good at it. usa gets fired up, liberals and conservatives come together, sing kumbayah, and good reigns in the end. or we're screwed...
he's from virginia and was involved with the sentencing of our corrupt republican governor (mcdonnell - "indicted on federal corruption charges for receiving improper gifts and loans from a virginia businessman"). boente stated "no one is above the law... not a high public official, not even the highest public official in [virginia]." interesting pick.
drain the swamp! then dig it deeper and refill it.
the purge has begun. how many more of our best and brightest will lose their jobs now?
dude it's going to suck in may. this is reality now. this is the new normal.
may? aw man. isn't it usually in february? better call saul got pushed back to april too. what am i going to watch (*has 200 shows and movies in netflix and prime queues*)
who the fuck wants to watch house of cards right now? honestly... i was planning to actually watch that show this year...i feel bad for all the people who worked on it because i might never see it now.
you're spot on. it's a pretty quick jump from "betrayal" to "treason" and i'm starting to worry about this administration's growing tendency to offer urban dictionary style alternatives to commonplace definitions.
wiki changes fast with news, those sections won't be reliable for a few days at least.
very bad. presidential cabinet positions exist to advise the president. trump did not allow her to see the executive order before issuing it.
my first political memory is watergate and the resignation. you aren't wrong here at all.
i was thinking about this for a while last night. he can do this for four years. there is nothing to stop him. it is so fucked.
i took my civics classes at betsy devoss' bible study and summer school camp. the kool-aid was delicious.
because the government is composed of its subscribers and its editor. that, and infowars perhaps.
trumps on a straight path to being impeached. my theory is, is that this is what the gop wants. they'll let him go crazy, get impeached, and then pence will be in office. after trumps craziness everyone won't both the gop too much with their laws because they won't be as crazy as trumps. it's the perfect bamboozle, just a theory though.
plot twist: he says tomorrow he won't defend the ban either and gets fired as well.
so he appointed someone who under the obama administration set a record for deporting people?
i'm honestly having a hard time playing video games right now. there is a tremor in the force... something... is happening.
if someone really drained a swamp, they would be removing mostly water. the muck, mud, and rot would be left in the swamp. so i guess he's making good on that promise.
soon any and all voices of reason will be replaced by yes men. then, presumably, he starts nuking everything.
more desperately than ever, we need you president underwood.
trump doesn't like the word "no" so he's removing anyone who says it.
the same folks who were complaining about obama using eos now want all eos followed to the very letter! the same folks who cry about "activist judges" want a wholly compliant ag willing to burn the constitution. hypocrites. all of them.
is it time to start getting a little scared? i mean i'm a white dude and this shit is a little concerning.
yeah, clearly jeff sessions is megatron, not red skull.
he also didn't show his new head of dhs. we thought there was a problem with transparency before? now even the people in charge of enforcing shit are out of the loop.
why wouldn't he show her? if she is supposed to help advise him, then why hide something like an executive order from her and then fire her?
yeah i've been freaked by this and my dad just went into a long ramble about the saturday night massacre. i guess i can see it.
2 years actually if people get out and vote for senate and house elections in 2018.
any time you see a simple adjective used twice in the same sentence, or the word "very," odds are trump wrote it. not saying it's bad writing, it's just completely counter to the style used in most pr/political writing.
the statement is almost comical. it really sounds like something written by an angry child. unfortunately, it's really scary that that he's surrounding himself with yes men and those who opposed him in the government were in the minority to begin with.
jesus. this is really happening to america isn't it?
be very afraid when words like "betrayed" are being used. not far from 3am knocks on your door...
it was a leading factor resulting in nixon's resignation though so maybe something positive might come out of this as well.
yes, but back then the country wasn't nearly as hyper-partisan as it is today. we have people that believe trump when he lies and there's proof on tape or photograph, why would they care if he eliminates everyone who shows a hint of backbone? and in fact, they may see it as a positive sign more of him "draining the swamp."
i'm becoming more and more convinced that you guys are seriously fucked at this point. i'm really worried for you, neighbors. actually, i'm worried for the entire global community. if the us implodes you're going to take the rest of us down with you. -canadian
who cares about the law of the land, and those enforce it? lets just write a law and see what happens.
alex jones has finally exposed himself as the "controlled opposition" many accused him of over the years. the dude is literally making up news now about how trump's approval ratings are higher than they were 1 week ago, and how everything main stream media is saying are all lies. alex jones is going all fucking in on trump. he's no longer a conspiracy nut, he's a propaganda mouthpiece for trump.
seriously guys, just think of the rest of the world that can't do anything but watch. please fight for us.
though after everything we've seen thus far, what makes anyone think trump will leave power peacefully? whether it be through losing in 2020, conviction by impeachment, or even pence and the cabinet utilizing section 4 of the 25th a., have we any evidence that trump & co. will respect those processes and abandon the office?
isn't that a reference to his order on federal regulations for businesses? because i saw a thread on that and didn't fully grasp it. what are federal regulations? how can he legally follow one and disregard two?
wouldn't that be something. all these twists and turns it's like we are living in a political drama on prime time tv.
ssshh. don't tell the_donald. obama was already deporting more people with criminal records than previous presidents.
i've noticed the same thing, normally i'd be balls deep in the overwatch event, cods 2xp week, or grinding it out in destiny. barely done any of that the last 10 days. there's dickery afoot in america.
i can't get over him appointing rick perry. my mind can't wrap around how it could possibly be true. it's just ridiculous to appoint him to that position it's like an snl sketch.
not only that, he was a man who didn't even know what the department *did* when he wanted to defund it.
don't forget about ben carson, a surgeon, for urban development.
as of today, "yes" and "no" will be replaced by "donald"
honestly, even when obama made an order that was being obstructed by congress et al, i didn't see anyone wanting complete and utter loyalty to the president, rather that they wished there were less republicans in control to obstruct what obama wanted. i feel as if trump supporters have this ill-informed notion of what exactly liberals as a whole were complaining about and are using that view as a means of "getting their turn", despite the majority of liberals never even wanting a turn.
obama used eos because of an obstructionist republican congress. trump has the votes in congress and still uses eos.
cheney did it for money. i'm not sure what bannon wants.
nah, megatron's views on race were pretty progressive.
presumably because he suspected she would react as she did, and didn't want to fire her preemptively.
the house is up for grabs, but there is a near-zero chance of democrats taking back the senate in 2018. to just tie, they would have to keep all of their current seats, and get *both* nevada and arizona. to get a majority, they'll also need one of the following: * mississippi, * nebraska, * tennessee, * texas, * utah, or * wyoming. the incumbents in each of those seats won their last election by more than 15%.
there aren't many republican seats in the senate up for reelection that year.
and it tells us he was furious. so furious that he insisted this exact statement be released and wouldn't leave it to his staff.
trump's style is very distinct. someone tried to convince me his long mlk day post was written by him when it so clearly wasn't..
"you said you wanted to be around when i made a mistake, well this could be it sweetheart."
really is. it's like watching a slow train wreck. but the real enemy are the voters who elected this man. they should not be let off the hook.
first they came for the... highest positions in federal government???
it's honestly the most worrying part of these last ten days for me.
trump will never resign voluntary. even if they impeach him, i imagine they'll have to drag him out of the white house kicking and screaming.
exactly. a trump supporters i'm friends with on facebook lauded this act and trump's executive orders as the beginning of a revolution.... (in a positive sense)
executive orders are not laws. only the legislative branch has the power to write laws.
hey, just in case you haven't seen the rest of the world (literally every continent including two separate protests on antarctica) is with you. toronto and london (and i'm sure others) had protests outside embassies and consulates. this is your fight, but you've got a friend in like....a few billion people around the world. let us know and we'll help.
so you are saying pence is actually palpatine and we just need a patsy jar-jar to call a vote of no confidence to remove trump and the sith will control the senate.
i'm not sure that trump got the memo that this isn't a tv show
the thing that worries me is if we eventually become numb to trumps antics. we all need to be mindful about resting and not binging on information. unplug for a while and don't burn out. we all need to be politically engaged these next 4 years. i'm saying this mostly to myself but i imagine others will agree.
same. barely touched any game for the past few weeks. i'm too fucking tilted and distracted to even have fun anymore. and when i tried again today, i went on a massive loss streak. i feel like i'm wasting my time on games when the country is actively being tramped on.
i've always thought it was like mr. burns hiring homer simpson as the nuclear safety inspector. burns knows that since homer knows absolutely nothing about nuclear safety he won't have to pay for any of the costly safety precautions that would otherwise have come up had a competent person been given the job.
what's terrifying is what he actually thought it would be. i mean to give him credit... if he thought the department was just for marketing oil interests, i can see why he thought it was a waste of money and should be shut down.
absol-fricken-lutely. actually, the president we really need right now is arnie vinnick. bartlett is great. but vinnick would be able to get shit done.
"doctor, is it cancer?" "aladeen...... i mean, donald "
my god, the comments. so much dumb in so little words
concentration camps, nah we prefer the term 'focus fairgrounds'. who doesn't love a fair?
or because he didnt know he was supposed to because he has no idea how government works. that's the funnier option i guess. and not unlikely.
dads. not just good for jokes anymore, but also apparently stories about nixon.
it mostly depends on how well trump polls and how closely those senators identify with trump. if he pisses everyone off, and those senators have records of supporting the decisions that pissed everyone off, they could lose their own primary to a challenger from the right who is anti-trump, and then the new person could lose to a dem, or the new person takes over and becomes a trump-dissident on the right. it's unlikely, but it can definitely happen. texas is probably the most likely, depending on how it goes down, because texas has really large liberal blocks in the cities.
every seat in the house of representatives is up for re-election, though
lol just didn't want that to be the focus of my post. people will tunnel on any little point they disagree with, just to avoid discussing the overall argument.
we should be hearing directly from him, in all his idiocy.
don't worry, they'll find a way to victimize themselves one way or another.
actually they came for the muslims first, then the government employees who stood up for them.
you know it's bad when a 16 year old dumbass on the internet writes more eloquently than the potus.
i'm 30. i was smarter when i was 16. the real world dumbs you down like you wouldn't believe.
has it really been 10 days? i guess time flies when you're...terrified for the future of humanity.
i left a post of mine open to the public recently and you wouldn't believe the kind of things i'm hearing from trump supporters about "liberal biased news."
well there it is. we now have a name for getting suicided.
until they are struck down by the supreme court, for all practical purposes in people's lives, they are laws.
especially how texas voted in the presidential election, it shows how much people really didn't like trump. and that number is only increasing in parts around the state
this is tremendously true. people get tremendously wrapped up in the tremendous way trump speaks. they just don't understand how tremendously the man trys to be a tremendous speaker. tremendous tremendous tremendous.
the muslims were bait. now trump has an excuse to replace people who don't agree with him.
he had already fired (forced to resign) most of the state department.
jesus that's scary when you put it that way. if the country were ever actually in *real* crisis, we could be just a step away from a modern nazi germany.. -people like to hark on the godwin's law, "oh there they go again comparing to literal nazis"; that's the thing, the nazis weren't fictional boogymen dreamt up that no group could possibly live up to, they were *real*. nazi germany was something that actually happened, something that arose from a nation of normal everyday people like you or i. we owe it to ourselves to keep remembering nazi germany, simply so we can remember the sheer capabilities of human nature.
this season of the apprentice is pretty dramatic.
they can be struck down by lower federal courts and not just the supreme court. eos don't have nearly the power of laws and can't involve the appropriations of money.
and exit when he tossed the assholes to the curb at the end of the scene.
that is because texas does not really want the wall.
watching that video, i'm not sure he sounds all that different, actually. i think he was just better at sticking to his talking points.
my phd advisor reminds me of trump to a t. the same blustering self-importance, the same speaking style, the same irrational anger and inability to control his words. the same bullying and harassment and need to control (it got bad enough that the university had to intervene to "protect me" from him...and i wasn't the first student in that position with him). and now i can add another thing to the list. my guy also used to be a much more compelling and eloquent communicator. his early research is great, but over the years the quality degraded so much as to be unpublishable (unless it's in the journal he edits, of course). if he wants something to be accepted for publication now, a grad student has to write it.
had seen a documentary a few years ago about how political figures who use simple sentence structures end up being seen as more charismatic... and get more votes. i've actually taken that idea on board in my profession (nothing to do with politics) always trying to "dumb down" what i say and write. must say i have seen positive results.
reminds me of that old family guy episode where lois just repeats 9/11 to become the mayor of quahog
my last work review essentially told me that i was confusing clients by trying to explain why i was recommending this or that test for their pet. so essentially i got reprimanded for not treating people like idiots. the sad part is that my boss was right. when i act super interested in them as a person and smile a lot and use (to me condescending) language - they love me and don't question a thing. when i try to actually explain the science behind what i'm recommending, well.... they don't love me nearly as much.
absolutely incredible! this is national geographic photo of the day material.
i'm just gonna borrow this for my clickbait site... for real if this is your shot you should have watermarked it, someones gonna steal it.
this shot is absolutely incredible. it almost doesn't even look real.
oh, shit! zapdos!!! guys it's zapdos!!! ... *cp 17*
1920x1080 version? beautiful shot, would love to have it as wallpaper.
jersey city also got to experience this storm. my basement has some water as evidence. great shot, though! it really was pouring and roaring out for a while.
saw this from brooklyn, myself. the storm was...intense, frightening, unconcerned by human worries. and it was thankfully quick.
this is an insane shot -- but it's definitely at least a long exposure. check out the boats in the marina -- you can see movement in the masts. my guess is that this is a few separate strikes that occured over a short period of time, vs one huge one.
i'm not doubting you op but my brain keeps thinking photoshop. i think it has to do with thinking that lightning doesn't spread out strikes like that cause it looks miles apart, but when i think about it doesn't make sense since lightning probably traveled miles vertically down just to strike.
how does one setup a camera to catch a shot like this?
pretty sure it's fake. just googled "lightning strike river" and all pictures had a bright reflection of the lightning strike. especially when it's this dark.
this is totally fake. there is no reflected light from the lightning anywhere. not the clouds, the water, the buildings. lightning isn't that thin either, regardless of focal length. the lightning in the background is in focus when it shouldn't be. even with a long exposure, and reducing your whites, lights, highlight, exposure, or whatever, that sky would still be glowing and the water would reflect it. also, there is a shelf cloud there. lightning like this generally strikes in the center of the storm, behind that shelf cloud and near the core.
yeah unfortunately the lack of fill light and reflections are telling me it's photoshopped....among other things
"and for that brief shining moment, new jersey felt as though it were part of new york."
i give it 12 hours before the facebook post: "on july 25, 2016, god performed a miracle. in the two cities struck by this same bolt of lightning, two children were dying of cancer. god struck them at the same time and cured both instantly, leaving doctors and scientists baffled. liberals say miracles don't happen but this is proof!!! like and share to spread the word of god's great power!"
theres heavy post processing / editing by the looks.
this is a picture of jersey city, taken from nyc. that's exchange place in the photo
the storms we just had in the nyc area were obscenely heavy. some of the heaviest i've seen. now, to anyone from somewhere they get real weather, feel free to call me a pansy. but today's storms were no joke.
sounds like you haven't seen much weather photography, or heavy weather. in mountain ranges, lightning can hit multiple peaks at once. it can shoot in multiple directions, and bounce off water to hit other objects. lightning doesn't just go straight down. in fact, most lightning goes cloud-to-cloud.
it may be, but it's a pretty passable image to me. with how quickly lightning comes and goes, long exposure wouldn't necessarily show the reflections. especially not on the water if it's windy. look at the masts on the boats, how they're blurry and smoothed out. the same happens to the reflections on the water.
why do i have you tagged as "gorilla suit banana party dude"?
and thank op and you for my new desktop background!
also a fantastic photo. so where is the third tree in the lighting one? it was disappeared?
i like being from montana, but sometimes i see stuff like this and i wish i was from a place like new york city where there's things.
how was the protip i just read the other day? crop your photo so in the case somebody steals it, you can always proof it was yours
i intentionally post images without watermarks and track their reuse with reverse image search services so i can extract settlements. it's a decent career deep web reuse like facebook posts are problematic though
i only shoot photos of my plumbing work for reference only, still add watermarks because i've no faith in humanity.
which doesn't really mean much these days. if you don't do it, the camera will.
florida native here, i see lightning like this every day of every summer.
i'm disappointed in you. not only did you steal the photo, you even stole the idea of stealing the photo from /u/pornandkarma.
so are we just skipping over the fact that /u/iamgmoney discovered that this photo documents the complete disintegration of a tree? my mind is fucking blown.
how's living in montana? i've wanted to move their i just don't have the resources yet to do so.
i loved that documentary on how twin pine mall became lone pine mall.
yeah should definitely do this. worse photos uploaded here have been stolen to hell.
i am interested in how this works. care to explain?
reddit reposts don't matter much though. he didn't take credit for it, and he's not making money from it either.
exactly. looks more like evidence of a long exposure shot (see the ship's masts in the foreground), along with some possible overlays completed post-shot.
yea, but it doesnt storm as heavily as it did during this incident. i spent a month in jacksonville and thought it was cool that it stormed basically same time everyday but besides the thunder and lightning it never felt like much of a "storm" if that makes any sense, at least compared to some of the ones we get in hawaii
it wouldn't look like this. there would be much more ambient light from the strike(s).
well you're in luck because i live in a 3 bedroom, 1 1/2 bath home worth 70k, and my house payments are about 700/per month. but you don't really need much by means of resources. it's the 4th largest state in the country and we just now got a million people so if you like to be all by yourself, you'll do just fine. we also have lots of of murder-animals, just to keep things interesting and make sure we don't get bored.
don't do it. move to some place like seattle. you get mountains like montana plus beaches, desert, rainforest, temperate forest, and also civilization. every city in montana is small, and most of the state is just empty. would not recommend.
i think the town's name of hill valley is just as funny. i mean which is it?
yup. posted a pic of me and a friend drinking 6lb milkshakes in a comment section once. chive jumped all over it, and we've appeared in their shit a few times now
this person is lying, so i wouldn't hold my breath.
i am from montana and currently visiting in seattle. wa has such diverse landscapes! it's really quite amazing. and the food in seattle is so great. ate at a little mexican joint on the other side of the block and it was better than any mexican place i have ever been to in montana. had filipino food yesterday. you'll never find that back home...
"you posted an image on the internet! gimme 10 thousand dollars, broke colkege student who just wanted to show his friends a cool photo!"
fairly newbie on reddit, what does the "other discussion" tab do? i clicked it and saw a shit ton of reposts to this guys pic. is that it's purpose?
i think that was the very first time we appeared. it's been funny to see it pop up, slowly pixelated as people steal it from one another.
holy shit that does look like chick and ruth's. awesome shakes, annapolis is an awesome town
what was the process in order to actually ask the candidates your question? did you sign a form, request using email yada yada yada.

how long have you had your mustache? have you ever experimented with other facial hair-styles?
what led to you asking about the environment? is that your biggest concern with these candidates or did the topic just feel unaddressed?
i saw a man with no teeth and no shoes standing on a corner in my new hometown when i moved there 3 years ago as i'm driving the moving van. here i am bringing all my stuff to a bigger, better house, thinking what hot shit i am for affording the place. then i see him and realize that he has literally nothing but the sign in his hand. people driving by him giving him no more mind than a street sign or a shrub. i drove on by, reasoning that i was too busy to stop and help him out, it was moving day. somebody else will give him a couple bucks. i never saw him again. is he ok? did he move on out of town? turn his life around? die in a gutter od'd on heroin? i'll never know cause i didn't give him the time of day. i was too busy pretending i had arrived. these are people who deserve love and happiness as much as me or anyone. but that day to me he was a shrub. never again.
too many weird, wild things to count. the most surreal was hearing back from @midnight which i love.
between that and what south park might turn me into i'm pumped. i know bobby moynihan would crush the bit, but maybe go leslie jones for shock value or something? i don't know. i'll get with my writers.
i am dying for bobby moynihan to get a shot. he needs a new recurring character (not that i don't love what he is doing already).
st. patrick center provides temporary housing, job training, drug counseling, and help with mental health issues. there is a severe homelessness problem in this country. most of us are one or two paychecks away from being homeless as well. we need to start seeing and intervening on their behalf.
i'm already the sexy ken bone so i'm thinking bust out the old jedi robe / lightsaber combo and be obi wan kenboni
we need more clean plants like mine to be approved for construction. older plants can't retrofit to be best in class environmentally because it would drive them out of business. that means we need newer ones manned by the displaced workers from those being retired.
several companies have approached me for endorsements. i have 2 rules for working with them. 1)it's a responsible company that i believe in and that i vet to the best of my ability. i will do my best not to associate with any companies that hurt the environment or their workers. 2) 10% of all money i receive must go to my local preferred homeless charity the saint patrick center in saint louis, mo. same rules for paid appearances.
as long as it's all in good fun i'm happy to laugh along with all of it.
radiohead is my all time favorite, nobody blends genres like thom yorke and the boys.
i know i look old cause i'm fat and bald and dress like it's 1954, but i'm only 34 and ineligible to run! there are over 2000, yes 2000 legally registered candidates. one of them must have something to offer. get your voice out there for one of them.
obviously reducing energy usage in the winter by providing everyone with stylish red cable knit sweaters, duh.
he talked to me about the peak of the coal industry in the 20s and how it has evolved with the nation's infrastructure over the years. then his security team reminded him that it was time to go yet again. i think his wife was waiting on him.
on soft ball and hockey rec teams i wore 18 for the great 60s era saint louis cardinal mike shannon. he's been the voice of the cardinals basically my whole life. stan gibson is for stan musial and bob gibson.
he sort of? answered this on his jimmy kimmel appearance i think, basically said he turned on his cell phone as soon as he was allowed and had a thousand+ messages lol
porque no los dos? you don't fill out a sweater like this by doing pizza anything half way.
cosby sweater drops roofies into stewarts drink, stewart sweater shivs cosby sweater with a sharpened tooth brush as it slips into unconsciousness. fred rogers og sweater game wins by staying positive and not getting involved in the fight. just like ken bone.
ken bone does not ask. he commands by his imposing yet cuddly presence.
yes, definitely. being undecided is not the same as being indecisive. we just have a lot to consider this election.
sandwiches are bread on top, bread on bottom. hot dogs are side to side with a wrap around. doesn't count.
my power plant supports a robust drug testing policy, sorry dogg. my dad on the other hand is all in.
it was a bad call. i need to fire my agent, except i can't because i'm my agent.
it's flattering, but please don't. i cannot serve since i'm not old enough.
somebody set one up on my behalf, but jimmy kimmel is buying me a new one since i did his show. i guess if go fund me sends me that money it'll go to the charity. you'll see me wearing it on his show next week.
i'm gonna be swamped with election stuff but pm me something and i'll get you a birthday greeting. here's hoping i don't forget and look like an asshole.
only if you advertise your party as the "bone zone bonanza"
i had this weird hallucination where all the sudden everyone gave a shit what i had to say. bizarre.
i don't even go to hoa meetings, but if i really thought i could effect positive change i'd consider it.
i'm in la late next week, maybe we can hook up. big fan here. my dad wants to roll wit da dogg big time, you me and him could do some tight stuff. that didn't sound cool at all, did it?
people say this election has been a disaster, but snoop dogg just replied in a ken bone ama to ask him to come smoke at his house. all because of this election. how is that not an unqualified success?
i love it. it's not fair to have a painting be so much more attractive than the real me!
what steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while remaining environmentally friendly, and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
we both worked at a bowling alley in granite city called amf bowland. i was a lane attendant which meant i walked around cleaning, throwing away beer bottles, and getting stuff from storage over to the bar and snack bar to restock during shift. she worked the snack bar, which meant i did none of the stuff listed above. i just watched her clean the grill cause when she bent to scrub it i could see dat ass was fat.
only the head nurse was able to speak up about it.
any president would be instantly twice as good for the country with this one simple step. appoint experts in each respective field to cabinet positions. not political donors or old friends i owed a favor. 2nd action, get blasted at camp david till i pass out.
they have been thinking it since the days of my great grandfather (swear on my life it's true) bentley bone and his son, my great uncle oriel (pronounced oral) bone.
"24 reasons ken bone is voting for clinton / trump" 431 clicks, this asshole still not telling me who he's voting for.
when it's cold in your jail cell. i'm not big on stripes.
what's an nfl? i'm from st. louis, something called an nfl has abandoned my twice in my lifetime already. that's more times than a typical dead beat dad and still they want my money. not happening.
the camera is still in my bag undeveloped. i'll tweet some of the pics out when i get them done.
had a goatee for a while, full on neck beard for about a year. clean shaven for a long time. the stache is for my grandpa, the first ken bone who tied in (not lost, it died too) his battle with cancer two days before christmas last year. his stache was unparalleled.
the flow of the prose and the consistency of language are beautiful. writing in that style is so hard to do without being over the top; you did so flawlessly. great writing, superb content. i love the gentle humor. you have perfectly captured the mix of dry wit, energetic humor, and underlying kindness that i hope has defined me my whole adult life. thank you, brilliant.
when i was 17 i spent a winter homeless. even as a young white female very few people were willing to help me out, there were nights i spent out in 3 degree weather because i didn't make it to the shelter on time. it was one of the hardest things i ever went though in my life. now as an adult i do everything i can to help the homeless who want to, get out of their situation. people like you give me hope.
we love you too, kenneth. it actually delighted me to hear you read my tweet. thank you for doing the show, encouraging people to vote and being an all-around good dude! ps - team mystic
i hope if south park does feature you its in some completely crazy random way, like you are a galactic invader with the bone-ers.
man are you seriously that good? wow!! insightful, conscientious, super funny, compassionate and intelligent. why the fuck couldn't you be our president?!
i think you are making a lot of people happy in a good way.
we need to get you on the "get out and vote" tour.
i was never a huge bill clinton fan, but this is textbook bill. used to see him do this all the time on tv. he loves talking.
your answer is better than any i could think of.
this is a man who understands that no matter who he supports, the internet will turn on him.
not hiding behind throwaways to comment on porn subreddits, you are an inspiration to us all.
i never knew who the people who commented on porn subreddits were. now i know, it's the undecided voters.
you say this, and we're all creeping the shit outta your post history like "he was among us the whole time!"
you would have the honesty appeal of a bernie sanders, the outsider appeal of a donald trump, the foreign policy experience of a gary johnson, and you'd be up against likely incumbent hillary clinton.
we need a tv show give a dogg a bone where you and snoop are detectives. his old partner (one day from retirement) is gunned down and you're his new partner. it's like a photonegative miami vice.
listen, how is every one of your responses perfect? how is it possible? great people can be at a loss for the perfect response, but bone, never.
ken's too big for you now. won't even you hit u back up in his ama.
this current season has so far had a strange lack of any sort of sci-fi element. what gives?
i did a video shoot for jokes for votes today, check them out.
do you feel, your boneness, that since your notoriety, you've remained just about the same bone as ever/
i wonder if john hodgman is going to be annoyed at our new consensus after years of getting pushback on his hard-line hot-dogs-aren't-sandwiches stance.
translation: pretty decent dude not using his position to influence people's decision based on fame.
theres just a lot of us so when we are clever it gets a lotta upvotes. we're all dumb as bricks, dont worry mate
"we don't take kindly to discrimination 'round these parts..."
as a texan i would like everyone to know that this is not that rare here. texas is a big place with loud, proud people. and of course there is hate, as in every place on earth. but there is so much love, acceptance, and kindness here that no one ever sees. this kind of thing makes me so proud to live here. we really do love y'all!!
not gonna lie, was expecting something entirely different.
plot twist: man is actually standing in front of westboro baptist church.
after reading a half dozen comments on his beard, i had to scroll back and check. santa confirmed. as a middle-of-the-road american, who leans left on some issues, right on others, and even agree with the libertarians at times, this made me happy. the biggest issue in the us today, from my point of view, is that no one's a moderate anymore. everyone's a fanatic. the politicians are using the same tactics as any other radical group to marginalize, demoralize, divide and recruit. they breed hate-filled fanatics and applaud them for "expressing their views", no matter how violent and destructive that expression may be. this man is the embodiment of what america wants to be, strives to be - should be.
people who havent lived in texas dont understand texas, its highly diverse and extremely complicated. been here for 30 yrs
my family is of mainly west texas caucasian stock, and when my company transferred me here (austin) i was a bit concerned. i remember hearing some of the most racist, angry, zenophobic bs from them growing up, and when i brought my dark olive-skinned ex-wife to el paso for a family gathering they were horrible to her. however, central texas is not what i expected when i arrived here a little over a year ago. this picture represents what i see throughout this part of texas, and i'm grateful. prejudice is a thing best broken, and broken harshly.
i have lived in dallas for two years, and honestly texas is one of the most open-minded, freethinking places i have lived. i am from colorado, and honestly there is way more diversity and less rednecks here in texas. it is not like the stereotypes at all. people don't give a fuck about gays, theres a ton of diversity. you see muslims, hindu, buddhist, etc. tons of people here smoke weed, etc. granted, it could just be in the cities that it is this way.
texas gets stereotyped as a bunch of rednecks and racists but i've never been to a place in the world (ok maybe canada) that is more accepting of people of all kinds. texas is its own little utopia in a way. it isn't perfect but there aren't too many things to complain about around here.
great. now we need about 60 million more of him.
whatever you believe in is your choice. at the end of the day you're just human living in a country that "hopefully" cares.
man holds a poster with feelgood text, reddit squirts over that.
this is a funny comment because it's true. we do love our signs.
1st amendment gets blasted into your brain pretty much from birth here so people are happy to express themselves. signs work well because they can communicate protester's messages in pictures. a big headline story with a picture of protesters holding their signs quickly communicates to people what the core of their message is. i've never considered that our infatuation with signs isn't normal around the world and now i want to look into this more lmao.
i hate protest signs, but i don't know how to express it.
i'm a texan muslim. you're right! i was pleasantly surprised to find that out for myself.
maybe you guys should go to r/politics to occasionally vouch for yourself. lots of hate on texas from people who haven't even been there yesterday lol.
see? we are all not bad here. people have this misconception of texas. most think we are a state of bigots...houston is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the us.
people don't realize how diverse and accepting texas actually is.
that's because the media has so frequently repeated how half the people in this country are alt-right white supremacist kkk supporting racist homophobes that we're starting to presume the divide and conquer narrative. same old song and dance, but hint, that's fake news. most people who voted for trump, even in a super red state, feel the same as this man.
no, he looks kind of like gandalf from harry potter
i read that as "real horses" for a second and was confused why a horse would wear a cape in the first place.
i dont think being a decent human being should make you a hero.
as a veteran and a texan, you aren't just welcome here, you belong here. for whatever reasons that brought your family here, it's because you belong here. you can change minds and hearts through actions, don't forget that.
i believe/hope that you are wrong. for instance, you just described me politically, and i'm sure a lot of other redditors sitting on their toilets right now as well. i think that the two extremes of each side would have us believe that we're more different than we really are. i look at all of this "we are so divided" on tv and think to myself: "probably not, in reality."
unfortunately, both sides will read this and only think of the other side as at fault.
also you drive for 2 days and you're still in texas. the fuck!
when people think of texas they think of the more rural areas and never think of the densely populated areas.
you go to a mosque and it's full of very church-y folk with funny accents and big hats making ridiculously spicy food to give to anyone who wants to come up and eat with them. i mean that's basically the *most* texan, right?
i would like to think that most people are like him, whereas bigots are just more vocal than the average person. well done to him. also, isis want us to hate muslims, that way some will feel marginalised by society and isis can come along and say 'fuck them, you'll never fit in with them, join us, this is where you belong', (i know most muslims are brilliant people and this happens rarely, but this is the recruitment strategy) - ~~racism~~ discrimination ultimately fuels terrorism.
austin is nothing like the rest of texas. austin is amazing.
texas's cities are very tolerant yes. the trick with texas is there's a lot of people not living in the cities as well, and out there it gets not so tolerant at all.
what i find absurd is that immigrants are suffering from discrimination when the fucking country was built by immigrants, it was always supposed to be made by people from all around the world who went there.
cool guy online mocks people for liking things that make them feel good, is very edgy, very cool, very fringe.
and 3 word slogans "build a wall!" "lock her up!" etc. oh and rhymes, a good rhyme will get you off a murder charge in america, "if the glove don't fit you must aquit!"
it seems like us americans have a sign for everything. i was driving around the other day and saw an electronic sign that said "pay attention to posted speed limits", so we literally have signs that say to look at the signs.
maybe because other counties don't have us style loitering laws. in other countries you don't see other people walking round and round in a circle protesting. if you can't stay in one place and shout for hours you need a way of getting everything you want to say across quickly.
however austin, ironically, has one of the starkest racial divides in the country if not the world (i-35).
that's kind of what i was thinking. i've lived in texas my whole life and this kind of thing isn't uncommon. not necessarily with the mosque and the sign but texans going out of there way to make others feel accepted is pretty normal. sure there are a few ass hats but most people are genuinely nice
then why did they vote for the man who promised to round up all the mexicans and wants to start a registry of people from muslim countries? it's not a false narrative that the media is painting, it's his own twitter stream. you can pretend you voted for economic reasons or whatever, but you voted for a man with deeply racist policies who is actively trying to divide the country. edit- i'm referring to "you" as the average trump voter you're talking about, not you in particular. should have realized this would bring out such wonderful responses. rather than respond to everyone individually i'll just say- if you are calling *people* illegal, you may be on the wrong side of history.
then why the fuck did they vote for him -_- "don't worry we can change his mind after we elect him! he just wants to be popular......." or maybe "dont worry about the bigotry, he's clearly a liar."
i agree. a decent act can sometimes just be a decent act.
he is not a hero for being decent, he is a hero for standing alone for righteousness when everybody around him is losing their heads.
i had the wrong impression of texas. i drove there from fl this year and i can honestly say that i would have never expected there to be a single progressive/liberal city. austin was amazing and is now a frontrunner to where i want to move next .... i thought denver or boulder would be, maybe atlanta or boston. i usually get tickets to festivals/events so that i can check a city out while also meeting locals. which cities should i check out next? i've got a year and a half left in fl and need to plan more trips!
most people may think like him, but most people don't have the courage or conviction to stand alone holding a sign standing up to those louder voices of hate.
as a muslim you dont know how happy it makes me to see that there are still many with a clear view like yourself
austin, houston, dallas and san antonio are nothing like the rest of texas.
the excuse i hear is that americans are ok with immigrants but don't want *illegal* immigrants. passports and visas weren't even invented until ww1.
three word slogans **three word slogans** ***three word slogans***
we have road signs that say "bump ahead" for like a one inch bump... i think you can get mini sized ones to wear as a belt buckle too...
actually, nobody beats the germans when it comes to signs. germans of reddit, can i get a little support here?
i have a few hard and fast rules that i feel apply to people in general. rule #3 is "people don't read."
as a server, i enjoy answering questions and talking about our food. gives me more of a chance to get to know the table.
i work in designing spaces like these and let me tell you its expected that no one will read signs. they're visual clutter but useful for some people who read and don't want to talk to anyone. other people want to talk to staff, more want to complain to whoevers listening. most people walk into a new space and forgey why they came. there's a lot of psychology in signs and no surefire solution for everyone in public spaces. maybe ikea. wander around and eventually you find what you want.
i used to steal jokes. i still do but i used to too.*
the assholes get more attention and are louder. that's the problem. recently there was a hate crime against a mosque up in north austin which got national attention. 1 person's actions. however the hundreds who showed up the next day to help clean the mosque and show their support got no attention. this ends up enabling the bigots.
he wants to deport the illegal immigrants that are convicted felons how is that racist? and they have come out to say that a muslim registry is not at all what the plan is. that's all a farce.
nah he looks like an older version of hagrid from star trek
he reminds me of that merlin guy from the old teletubbies manga
when ~~everybody around him~~ a vocal minority who gets media attention is losing their heads.
agreed, i think also most people don't realise how bad racism is. if you're not exposed to it you can't really know. i heard a story once that a sikh british guy was in europe and had queued up for a coffee, but when he tried to pay he couldn't pay, so the guy behind him in the queue paid for him, saying "what's the world coming to if a brit can't buy a fellow brit a coffee?" the guy said it meant a lot because he'd never actually been referred to as british before.
i grew up in a white area with no outside influence and after 9/11 i thought it must be a shitty religion. i didn't have a clue until i was 20 and actually visited countries where 90% of the population were muslim. people were so lovely. they went out of their way to be nice to me. it made me realise how skewed the media was. i went to university and learned a lot about a lot of different cultures and religions. i visited america recently and in my opinion, people in the arabic countries that i visited have a better quality of life than americans. there's just more of a strong community feeling and helping each other, whereas in america it's all about helping yourself.
i knew you couldn't trust people from illinois. i always thought that state acted a little funny.
yet, no sign for the 3 foot deep pothole! agggrraarrlll!!!! that's the noise i make when i hit a freaking pothole!
i had this happen at wal-mart once. i was working as a parking attendant and our shirts were blue. so walking around wal-mart in a blue shirt (with very large letters that say parking on the back, and the venues name on the front) means i work at wal-mart. this happened on three or four occasions. i also worked at a museum where i had to stand right next to sign that said bathrooms with an arrow pointing to the bathrooms. every five minutes someone would ask me where the bathroom was. i got so fucking irritated with people that i would preempt the conversations with pointing at the bathroom sign. at least my boss found it entertaining so i didn't get into trouble for not being good at customer service.
that guy would've gotten a nice string of expletives in his telling off. i am an angry person.
the fact that tolerance for other religions is considered "liberal" is one of the fucking problems with this damn country
so, saying we are one america and welcoming muslim americans to feel at home has a leftist only appeal? are you saying the average right-leaning person does not believe america should feel like home to all its citizens? i guess i'm leftist. thanks for the truth about right-leaning folk though.
yeah that really pisses me off about the media. always focusing on the negatives. the same way i hate the celebrity scene for making people feel like they're not good enough..to the point that young kids want to (and do) have their labia lips cut off because they think they're not pretty looking.
similar situation. i'm liberal, but i get the sense that many liberals think that because they consider themselves liberal, they are automatically accepting and caring. btw i'm very accepting and caring.
the biggest difference i see between texas and any where else i've been is in texas you can walk by a stranger and say hello and they will say hello back. in california, they look at you like you are crazy for talking to them. in new york, they just straight up say 'fuck you'
this is not what he said during the campaign. he explicitly said during the campaign that he wanted to get rid of all of them. this means that he used the bigots in order to get their votes, and now he's softening that stance. so don't try to deny what he has actually said and done. **tl;dr: you can gaslight some people but not all of us are going to forget.**
maybe you're mistaking him for kayser soze of jurassic park
right? my wife were watching when that guy said that live on the news and we're like ".... and that's bad because why?" people are scared of delicious and easily accessible tacos everywhere!?
3/4 of trump voters believed obama was a foreigner.
british guy ordering a *coffee*? i call bullshit.
ditto. i'd have gone the fuck off. *"listen here asshole, even if i did work here, i wouldn't help you because you treat people like shit. so fuck off and buy whatever is so god damn important that you need to have your hand held during it's purchase. dipshit."*
no, the norm would be the overwhelming amount of people that don't even think about it and just go about their daily business.
the only way this is the exception is the fact that this guy is holding a sign about it. this type of thinking is the norm, but you wouldn't know it from only reading signs being held outside mosques, for obvious reasons.
god yes, a thousand times this. i know leftists (won't use the term liberal, because the meaning has been hijacked) who are the ugliest people you will ever meet, and right wingers who will give you the shirt off their back if you are truly in need. political ideology -=! compassion.
i would wager i could walk up to the next 50 people i see in new york city and say hello and none of them would tell me "fuck you". they might be terse in their response because they assume i want something from them, but that's not the same as outright hostility.
i mean tbh his beard is kind of similar to king leonidas of sparta's beard from die hard 2
pay-it-forward v keep the change: dawn of politeness.
not sure why he said tacoma but the toyota tundra is built in san antonio and tons of texans drive them because of it.
we drink things other than tea honest. it might only be alcohol with the occasional coffee for the morning after....oh and iron bru if your scottish but it's not all tea!
you guys are saying the same thing. in terms of "people who hold signs outside mosques", someone holding a sign of acceptance rather than hate is the exception. in terms of "what people think about muslims", acceptance is probably the norm.
standing there holding the sign is exactly the exception they're talking about. not the sentiment itself.
he does sort of look like an old tyler durden from legend of zelda though
and probably spends his time making signs, smoking brisket and feeding his pet tiger.
tundras are also really solid trucks for the money. just saying
it's not the norm going by what i've been reading in reddit comments for the last 6 months. but then again i guess reddit is a minority in the grand scheme of things.
a world without /u/dolphin_titties is a world i don't want to live in.
thanks? i'm from canada. it's how i see it anyways.
the dog on the left looks like william h macy in shameless.
the dog on the left looks like it's seen some shit..... and probably ate it.
i'm imagining that the cat hates the dog at the back and the dog at the back photobombed the photo just to piss the cat off.
how is this actually achieved? is the camera just on a timer or something?
what is up with all these mother fuckin cats taking all these mother fuckin selfies??
everyone's got to have those big guys in your crew that will fuck somebody up for you.
fun fact women that frequently use snap chat filters in their pictures are 10x more likely to be shooting up heroin in the street at some point in their life than people that just take normal fucking pictures.
wow, that's a frank dog. just started watching that show recently. pretty good so far, almost finished with season 1, will probably give season 2 a shot.
is there a sub for animals that look like famous people?
the text and frame in the middle need a black border. it'll pop better. but this is still amazing.
slightly off topic, but my brother adopted a mentally retarded dog, and gave him an instagram account. he's got more followers then my wife, which is hilarious.
i can't tell if it's sad or amazing that i've considered buying a retarded dog and giving it an instagram account as a fast track to fame.
i love the smell of fresh burn in the morning. god help me i love it so.
holy shit i thought this was a "your mom" joke but thank you
they were awesome when they were indy, but they started to suck after they sold out to sony music.
in australia they're called little ass-lickas dogs are rollies
"fuck animal control comin' straight from the pound...young rottie got it bad 'cause i'm brown!"
oh the one with the shower hat... he thinks he's people
oh man, i didn't know you could get double digit results in google. but 1? really something historic about this.
til. can't wait to boast off my newly learnt australian lingo to my colleagues.
my owners are gonna have to come and get me off yo grass, that's how i'm goin out, for the old ass mother hubbards that's showin out
id like to think i'll remember this moment, when a year from now everyone is asking old people why they're calling flumbleputters cats.. just gotta tell us the correct word for kitten now..
fuckin' wit me cause i'm a terrier, with a little bit of bone and good behavior
they are umbleputs. they have to grow into their flutters.
were the arrows in the original? i'm being thrown for a loop
well, i can see there's some sort of mis-match in the background. is it the compression algorithm?
trump looks the most in love with him. ivanka, kate, emma, and background intern just wanna smash.
that's prime minister steal yo girl, thank you very much.
i mean, trudeau is a tall man with good hair, clean skin, a nice figure and a pretty face. plus, he's the damn prime minister of one of the biggest countries in the world and speaks english and french. so it's like, more than understandable.
it's funny living in alberta. everyone around the world loves trudeau and yet everyone around me hates his guts. we are truly the texas of canada.
the princess kate one is the best, such a classic "ohmigod he's looking right at me" look. he probably said something like "hello, i'm justin" and she replied something awkward like "you too."
so that's what it looks like when a girl wants to fuck your brains out. i always wondered...
well he is handsome. but some pics make him look funny (looking at you wikipedia, i had to google this guy, sorry eastern european here)... either way i am looking at ivanka and wondering how teh fok did she come up to be so pretty when her father is male version of dolores umbridge
i laughed until i saw emma watson. back off trudeau.
i love how prince william used to be considered boy-band-quality dreamy, and now he's a creepy, stereotypical caricature of english royalty.
are they attracted to his perfect face and body or is it the passion and political power? or maybe.... he has a sweet sweet voice i have yet to hear.
i love the number of people referring to trudeau as a "cuck" here. just look at him, he obviously lays more pipe than transcanada.
pretty sure i'm ovulating right now. also, i'm a man.
most canadians i know thought justin was too young and inexperienced to be prime minister. i think he has been very professional, knowledgeable and articulated. he also seems well liked by most world leaders and the public in general. kudos mr. trudeau.
i don't know, it looks like obama's trying to let him down gently.
you can't meme someone into the whitehouse without some side effects.
i'm glad someone else noticed the intern - that dude is swept away.
the right honourable prime minister steal yo' girl
can confirm, it's weird hearing all of my family in ab spit hatred about trudeau and what a terrible job he's doing, especially after getting major pipelines approved for the province (something i don't think harper ever could have done). everyone i talk to in bc that doesn't like him is due to either actually approving those same pipelines or his flip-flop on changing the electoral system. most people i talk to love him though.
there is a good 50% of people across the country who will hate the current prime minister while in office, no matter who they are or what they do. the people who bitched about harper are now bitching about trudeau, at least in my experience.
he's losing his charm across canada. fucking electoral reform, man.
weird. i live near toronto. everyone i know voted for him and now hates him.
he goes for a handshake and you kiss his hand instead?
"hello, i'm kate, prince bald's wife. it's great to have you hair. shit."
and william is thinking, "i am *so* going to use my secret british army ninja training to fold this guy over backwards and mail him to australia."
it's like shes a teen and meeting her favourite pop star in person. what an obvious break of character for a princess.
to have a woman this beautiful (top 5 in world in my opinion) and this prestigious swoon over you.... i literally can't imagine what kind of feeling that must evoke.
i feel like most guys may have had a woman give them that look before, but like most pics, they're looking in another direction.
there's no denying that barack is one suave motherfucker.
you should listen to the joint press conference that he gave with drump. he answered in english and french, and he sounds like a drang hunk.
any time i hear someone use the word "cuck" my immediate thought is "this dude has never had sex".
i know his secret. i'm on my way to beauty! -cramming poutine into my face-
i've spent a long time trying to figure this out, but i think i understand it now. for some reason for his entire life he's loved that particular haircut (i guess it's supposed to be some kind of high class/power hairstyle, i have no idea). but he started to get a receeding hairline eventually. to combat this, he grew out the hair from the back half of his head so long that he now combs it forward so it completely covers his face, then he folds it backwards about 3 inches from his forehead, and combs that part backwards, then uses like a flat iron or something to crimp it so it gets that sharp curve in the front. then he uses a fuck ton of hairspray, so much to the point that his hair is just dead and like that all the time.
somewhere out there, someone is furiously writing filthy trudeau-obama fanfic.
"now look. you and me... uhh, we're never gonna be, you know, exclusive. but that doesn't mean we can't, uhh... "play doubles," if yaknowwhatimean..."
yeah bud, lets go smoke some darts out behind the zellers later. my cousins got a skidoo he needs a starter for, but i know a guy in mirmachie who has one he'll trade for a 6 pack of keiths.
it's not the amount of resources you have, it's how you use them ;)
i know, him being a family man just makes him even more attractive?? not in a homewrecker way, but a dreamy way...
i'm sure it's because he supports gay rights and goes to pride parades.
canadian hate: "i wouldn't even mean it when i say 'sorry'"
it's probably similar to how a lot of people hated obama for things like "ruining the country" and "hating america."
i hear a lot of anonymous internet people declaring that they hate him but nobody that i actually know regrets voting for him.
any suggestions for what to do with a garden hose?
more like he goes for a handshake and you bat his hand away so you can vault up and leglock him around the waist. then see how long you can hold on and keep necking with him while laughing rcmp do their best to separate you two.
kates first thought: his kids would always have hair!
isn't trudeau a fairly competent* fighter? boxing or something?
she must be an amazon, idris is a giant. even accounting for heels.
i mean, i'm a completely straight married man and that's probably how i'd look in front of idris elba, too.
studies show any man that can immediately transition from english to french within a single conversation has a 97% chance of stealing your girl.
i always think "this dude is 14, lives in his mother's basement, and wouldn't know what to do with a girl even if he found one at the bottom of a bag of cheetos".
if the universe is infinite, the events of that fanfic are actually happening somewhere right now.
and here some people think we're only provincial up here.
how to get someone to like you: step 1. be attractive step 2. don't irrationally hate on them
compared to movie stars, no he's not hot. as world leaders go? he's a goddamn dreamboat.
nah, in this case it's real hate. they're just toeing the party line for the conservatives they'd like to see back in power.
so far, that's what i've seen. i've asked family for specifics about things that he's screwed up and they flail trying to answer it rationally. after that they like to make fun of how he used to be a drama teacher and how much they love his hair (no joke).
i voted for him even though some of his policies hurt me financially. i like him as a prime minister, and think he's going to do a lot of good. if this topic were about wynn i would have a completely different frame of mind.
now i imagine some exasperated rcmp officer going "*sigh* not again. ron, get the prybar! we got another one!"
ok, but to be fair. the prince has served actively in several of the uk armed forces, including training in marines and special forces, is 6'3", and is 10 years younger. i think the prince is going to win this one.
she's 5'9", idris and william are each 6'3". so she's wearing 4" heels or so here, depending on the camera angle.
i'm a straight man and recently i've been noticing how insanely handsome other guys are, like trudeau and elba, like "wow, that guy is super attractive. like so attractive i wanna marry him and have two kids, a mid sized house with a white picket fence, and a golden retriever."
inferior to the effectiveness of the irish accent, which is basically a season pass to poon-town.
you know to be entirely fair to 14 year olds, i don't think most of us would know what to do with a girl we found at the bottom of a bag of cheetos.
here! i've got an idea. suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the romans', but that he can have the *right* to have babies.
i'd like to open one of those up in southern california. i'd name it "cal's local socal lo-cal calzone zone"
do they want a donald trump? because that is how you get a donald trump.
"pffft, he was a part-time drama teacher before he became pm." "yeah, but in between those jobs he spent seven years as an mp, learning how the government runs." "..."
even though i support the liberal party, wynne can go fuck herself.
and then the torrent of "sorries" as they muscle the prybar between the prime minister and his admirer and wrench them apart.
an in this corner president of russia vladimir putin and in this corner prime minister of canada justin trudeau lets get ready to rumble!!!!!
for some reason that was always just an actor that looked an awful lot like idris elba in my mind.
that's the beginning. eventually you'll be giving handjobs to strange men in airport bathrooms and running for congress on the republican ticket.
no worries, those from quebec are too worried about their quebecois accent to speak it outside of quebec unless they need to. our french is not the french people think it is.
everybody always says the potus chair ages you, but if you take anybody in their fourties and add eight years they are going to look ragged in comparison. aside from that i have a suspicion that they stop dying their hair black/brown/whatever and let the natural grey come through in a concerted effort to advance their image. there is a youtube video where a dentist or orthodontist analyzes the teeth of politicians and every one of them is more fake than an aging porn star. ever since kennedy looks has played a huge role in how successful a politician is and they all know it. their image is either priority one, or two.
i'd seen trace mentions of a hilarious handshake, but wow. i love the way trudeau looks down at his hand as if to say "are you actually trying to use a macho powerplay on me?"
also what's wrong with being a teacher? and a teacher in the creative arts? that shit is commendable.
i'm also mad about electoral reform, but i still see him as a better leader than anything the other parties have come forward with.
that would be a fight to see. putin doesn't have the striking but he's got his own finishing move and apparently has really kept up with the training.
let's not forget that putin has been training in judo since 14 and is somewhat of a renowned judoka in competition circles. he also was a kgb agent, adept in several martial arts, including karate. as much as i love my prime minister, he'd get dummied by putin for sure.
this was from the era where the wire ended and half the cast randomly got hired by the office
6'3" is downright gigantic for an actor, very few are taller than 6' unless part of their persona is to be the "big tough guy". arnold schwarzenegger, the unstoppable killing mechano-man, is only 6'2" according to his bio, although the folks i have talked to who have seen him in person say he is probably closer to 5'10". sylvester stallone is only 5'10". patrick dempsey? 5'10". bruce willis? 6'. robert downey jr. is only 5'9".
has anyone compiled a gallery of before and after pictures of presidents along with their defeated opponents from their first election? i.e. barack 2008/2016 and mitt romney 2008/2016. mitt romney doesn't seem to have aged much since 2008. but i think he's older, so he may have already gone through the aging phase that obama has. obama's looks may not change much in the next 10 years, but that may not be connected to no longer being president.
maybe it's just that gif, but it really looks like trump's going fora bit of a knuckle crusher on that handshake.
conservatives tend to disrespect art, calling it useless or immoral, unless it promotes their own values.
exactly. i was mulling over voting mulcair but boy was i right to avoid voting ndp. those guys are a shit show. i lost all respect for mulcair after that elbowgate nonsense. the dude is just weak and can't keep his temper in check.
i would kill to have celebrity death match brought back
in a stunning betrayal, ivanka steps into the ring and hits putin with a metal chair. saying: "i did it all for justin".
no way downey is 5'9". he wears gigantic shoes (even with tuxedos). he is 5'8" at best. willis is 5'10" at best but yeah, actors tend to be short musicians tend to be even shorter
he's calling the hump walt. he shouldn't want the hump.
this was a top tier comment/thread sometime within the last week in askreddit. multiple people discussing how awesome it would be if they brought that show back. odd timing. conspiracy detector activated. yes, mtv marketing team; it *would* be a hit if you guys brought it back. ;)
given the trumps' affinity for pro wrassling, i wouldn't be surprised if she has learned chair-fu from mcmahon himself.
you guys have really weird standards about what is considered short. the average male height is around 5'8-5'9. why is it abnormal that actors fall within this range?
wouldn't you want to cover up your actual work with a nondescript desk job?
you mean the eric cartman in this photo looks like a lens flare.
gawd damnit!! meeeeeeeeem, reddit is making fun of me again.
til the animation of cartman is basically just two circles.
it's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation, this sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation.
going down to south park, gonna have myself a time
eric foreman popped in my head at first and i was like "no it doesn't"
it's just london from a different angle, just not big ben from the thames like everyone's used to
you mean the photographer spent like 5 minutes lining this up just right and is passing it off as spontaneous and random
it's ok. butters can get that safe space up and running in no time.
don't think just because i got a lotta money i'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey.
you just learned that? they filmed an entire season with stop motion cardboard circles moving around.
friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation!
what don't you get? it looks like the character eric cartman from south park.
your username is my favourite username of all time.
gherkin, walkie talkie, shard... all those other buildings that i presume also have names.
to be honest i never really knew how many skyscrapers were in london. i find that mildly interesting too.
a person who is not familiar with south park would not get it
-are you cooing at me? are you cooing at me? ........ i don't see no one else here..
i was just trying to work that out as it's not a common angle. i think it's taken from the barbican.
one sec.....oh so that's what's been bothering me all day....
didnt click the link but i know the quote from those pigeons from animaniacs
ooooh, i 'member the time i visited that site just to watch full episodes of the series for free.. ooooh, i 'member!
well then i know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with mommy tonight!
i totally read it correctly... but i'm desperate for a cause... so 7
it's four f's, i didn't know it was gonna come off like that.
reminds me of the sandals that some prostitutes would wear in ancient greece. instead of (hopefully) unintentional swastikas, though, theirs would say "follow me," for people to see the tracks in the dust. it was a marketing thing. furthermore, carthage must be destroyed.
"just walk through the puddle jerry, you're wearing boots for christ sake."
do you know why the nazi uniform used boots? hilter hated the shoes.
and no customer reviews, yet ... have fun, reddit
$39 boots... those are gonna fall apart in 3 months.
4/5 stars... "these boots were good, but not great. they're just altright."
yeah, those are definitely catering to skinheads.
dennis' "pretty sure you did" was perfect. wording, delivery and tone...
cato, dude it's been over 2000 years let it go already.
read this as george constanza. "i don't wanna walk through the puddle!" replied, jerry. "you got some of those nazi boots, didn't you?" said kramer.
what amuses me is how it looks like it's been specifically engineered to make a perfect imprint of a swastika. i can't remember what it's called but when designing etching patterns in microlithography you exaggerate shapes and cut extra into corners to account for overetching and underetching in certain areas, so you get the same slight difference between pattern and print as is shown here.
it could be manufactured in a country where swastikas are considered a sign of good luck. you know, like one of those countries where 96% of the worlds manufacturing takes place.
i do think it is intentional. designers do a lot of things they try to get away with. part of the reason is that many (most?) designers have their design goes through a protracted, tedious approval process, often with no clear chain of authority or custody. so many innocuous elements are pointed out as having some kind of negative connotation. marketing people tell you to make the logo bigger because that somehow will make it more an effective or recognizable design. non-designers meddle with designs in ways that undermine their integrity. designs are needlessly compromised and rearranged by people who have no idea what they are doing, often just so a manager can exercise authority. in short, designers are not typically allowed to do their jobs. so there is a whole culture of doing things like this. there are plenty of funny less offensive examples. however, maybe it was meant as an editorial comment on the employer.
honestly, fuck news articles that are just a reddit page. yeah, i'm sure it was so much work to copy and paste every line op wrote.
dammit, himmler, i never said get rid of the jews, i said get rid of the shoes!
"i've tried a lot of boots, but these will be my final solution" great work guys
"very good at curb stomping, i mean, hiking. 5/7."
i can't see the swastika mentioned anywhere... i wonder how many are walking about not knowing their leaving a trail of agony behind them. especially since these kind of boots are pretty great in many ways, there should be plenty!
1/5 stars "shoelaces came tied in little knotsies"
i'm surprised there isn't a "user's also bought" section with red laces and mein kampf or a buy all three offer
glenn gives some of the best deliveries on the show. dude's such a phenomenal actor.
"they are not nazi boots! it's a tread! don't you know about tread?"
c'mon guys, it's time to hammer this out into an entire seinfeld script. jerry's bought some nazi boots, but what are the other plotlines? gotta be some accidental jewish gathering that kramer manages to put together without realizing it and george has probably fallen for the female rep from the nazi boot company after he suggests he might be an anti-semite.
funny because of potential seinfeld joke? or because of war time slang for germans?
exactly. the soles don't look *that* much like swastikas, but the prints are unmistakable. and whoever made the soles would have understood that.
in an alternate universe, that's currently the unifying symbol for earth and humanity. maybe these boots belonged to an inter dimensional traveller?
or they were made for skinheads, who often wear workboots as part of their outfit.
hahaha that's amazing. my other favorite "i bought these for camp. when i got there i found out they had piles of free shoes. oh well."
the comments are flowing now. pretty much swastikas galore. this company will have to pull them from amazon now. pretty sure their target audience just shrank considerably.
took years for this to sink in to me. then i bought a good pair and they lasted me 8 years of year round wear. still can't fathom where i lost those things...
white laces, not red. red is for the original skinheads, the good kind. neonazi skinheads (aka boneheads) wear white.
his acting in mac and dennis move to the suburbs is fantastic. i live for dennis' meltdowns.
he's incredible, his non-verbal facial subtleties are so fucking dark and comedic!
"oh i know about tread. don't tread on me, nazi boy!"
jerry notices the mark right as he has to pick up his parents from a jewish funeral and he already threw away his old shoes. to avoid being found out jerry turns his shoes inside out ruining the insides. everyone comments on how disrespectful it is that jerry wore slippers. meanwhile, kramer had lost bob sakomono's dog so had learned to animals tracking to find it and had tracked it to the cemetery. kramer comes upon the unique boot prints and starts to follow them instead. he loses the trail but then meets up with the gang at the funeral. kramer notices jerry's shoes and starts asking a bunch of questions which jerry avoids. "ok jerry give me the shoes." "i don't wanna." *grabs for them* "no kramer!" "nazi! we've got a nazi here!" "i'm not a nazi what're you crazy?!" "ok what size shoe are you jerry?" everyone: "just tell him what size show you are jerry" "nine! nine! nine!!"
also, it might be a bit of a stretch, but there's eight of them, and 88 is the numeric abbreviation for heil hitler.
i mean, its still swastikas on the soles. they just don't look as much like nazi ones.
or in this universe, it is a symbol of good and one guy used it for bad stuff and the other half of the world doesn't care about one turd.
i mean if you look at the boot it's the correct direction
this. that was on purpose, so skinheads can stomp swastikas into things.
q: where does hitler keep his armsies? a: in poland.
i love them too, they really put me in mein kampfort zone.
i lol'd ridiculously hard when i read that comment. so subtle that you wouldn't even think it's a joke unless you knew what lies underneath.
i like how "was this review helpful to you?" is functioning as upvote/downvote
my dad wore a darth vader cape on his first date with my mom. it was at a normal restaurant, not a nerd thing, and they'd never met before.
kinda stinks for them though if this was a honest mistake
their work was done and they simply dissolved around your feet all at once. they'd given you all they had.
perhaps there is some wet cement involved. perhaps elaine's boyfriend is a construction worker.
if this is done on purpose than i really don't think thats a stretch. neo-nazis love that shit, and also 8 on each foot so 88.
the soles would have been produced in a factory using a mould which is the inverse of what's on the sole. so whoever made the tooling to make this boot would have had to cut out very clear swastikas.
3: the nazis picked one of a million other symbols to fuck over, instead of the swastika.
well just like occam's razor, it's not a hard and fast rule. it means not to assume bad intent outside of any evidence to the contrary. it's a good interpersonal rule for small disputes, especially when dealing with strangers. most of the time it's just not worth the headache to get worked up over.
"dark humor is like food.... not everybody gets it." josef stalin
that "yeah?!" was definitely the best part of that episode.
i bet that employee was on the way out of the company when they did this! maybe a going away present, if you will.. or maybe it's for their target market..
we can choose to not allow the symbol to be ruined, as an extra "fuck you" to one of the shittiest people to ever live.
fun fact: a "razor" is basically a rule of thumb that lets you "shave away" unlikely possibilities. that's why they're called occam's razor and hanlon's razor. i just learned this recently and i think it's really interesting!
because everyone thinks he's a great and funny guy which confuses her and makes her think it's just her imagination
yes, the pacing is much better and the characters are more likable. all around better season.
it's much better. every episode is engaging. there is also a nazi orgy.
holy shit, that's awesome! i just assumed he was finished with it.
cool, i was super excited for the series just based on the previews/trailer. watched season 1 episode 1, felt like a 2 hour slow-burn thriller only to realize it was like 45 minutes... i haven't been able to make myself watch episode 2 :(
little kids have such strong grips. they're like orangutans.
was this from michigan yesterday? because it got crazy
aren't storm doors supposed to have a chain, or a hydraulic/pneumatic closer that would keep this from happening?
hold the door hold th door hold th dor hold th dor hol th dor ho t dor hodor i'm gay
when my sister was little, like 3, her and my mom came out of the mall and there was a small tornado (dust devil, if you will) ripping through the parking lot. my mom swears she held onto my sister as she was up in the air, over my mom's head, as the dust devil blew through. then my sister landed safely on thd ground and they continued as if nothing happened.
this sums up what its like to be a parent pretty well. watch the kid go all the way to the door and turn your back.... *woosh* shit you could never have guessed goes wrong.
she held onto the fucking door knob like a champ too
i imagine mum was like, 'you can play with the phone, but if you drop it santa won't be visiting you this year'.
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon/ at least tell me if the phone survived or not.
so, the doormat is english and the door is scottish?
it's easy for kids to hold their own weight. jungle gyms.
young kids can hang on like that because their weight is relatively small compared to their size and muscle mass. they're a lot weaker, but they barely need any strength to hang on.
wichitan here... last weekend give you ptsd from this?
somehow i don't think r/blowingchildren would go over very well.
poor lil dude. gets slapped upside the head repeatedly.
how do you envision "door" and "dor" being pronounced differently?
parenting sucks, and by extension being a teacher as well. you don't focus on the kid for a second and you get punished by everyone else for saying "you didn't do your job, it's your responsibility!" fuck off and cut good parents and teachers some slack, it's not like they're pumped up on drugs in the car while their kids are crying and some fucked up police department thinks it's funny to take pics of it and broadcast it to the world.
my mom told me something simmilar. only thing is she had 2 sons so when she turned her back we either started doing something that could easily kill us, or were trying to kill eachother
she handled this probably better than i could now. the gif cuts off a little early but it looks like she's done significantly moving and still has a solid grip on both the door and the phone. someone get this kid to a climbing gym.
as a scot if this were truly the case i'd need to make a correction: doormat: "welcome!" door: "u gonna naw touch ma knob m8, fuck right off ya cunt!"
true. tried doing the monkey bars the other day. made it halfway and gave up.
this is what i tell myself at the rock climbing gym when a 12 year old warms up on the stuff i'm currently struggling with.
i liked the little girl's face at the end. like she didn't didn't know what to think about it right away and needed time to process everything.
it's what he deserves for pushing the can instead of pulling, wind is just trying to educate.
i have power but no internet :| and half of my town has no power with no eta.
my dad actually is an exec at dte and he said it got up to 700,000 there are teams coming in from 8 states around
working ice rinks, it was always entertaining to explain that to people that would ask "why can the little kids just bounce right back up, but when i fall it hurts so bad?" my go to was "well you're a hell of a lot bigger than they are. you fall farther, and hit harder." skate away, let them ponder that. most just got insulted, and i was entertained. some would realize it actually does make sense.
that clip is nothing less than amazing. i've seen it before, very little else compares to it.
so are you getting paid to spam this shit? and you got other dummy accounts upvoting you. yea i can see it in your history. just write some random shit, then every once in a while spam the jeff dunham links in your edits. are you part of a jeff dunham team lmfao
am parent. wife is parent and preschool teacher (special needs, no less). can double confirm.
i just started climbing the rocks.... this girl would wreck me.
as a former minor league baseball mascot who had to intentionally lose a race around the bases to a kid every night, this brings me great joy.
so uh, asking as someone who knows dick about american football; do mascots usually participate? i might have to reevaluate the sport if people getting pummeled by overgrown plushies is a common feature.
future actress that does her own stunts. think big.
halfway? you must work out. i can't even climb the rungs.
this is why i am so baffled by how everyone was like "ermagherd rock climbing legend" for that 12 year old asian girl who is like 16 or something now. i got shit on for saying children have jacked power to weight ratio's basically.
i had to watch it like 6 times to absorb just how incredible it fucking was.
i've been seeing it around for months now, they post low effort content to look like a normal user, if something catches on they'll edit the post to include jd spam. it used to be two-video youtube playlists, the first video would be semi-on-topic, then it would autoplay the same jd spam. just report it and move on.
just some guy on here. can confirm, seen kids before.
it's insane how much upper body strength kids have compared to their weight.
your comment deserves more visibility. i spent too much time as smokey the bear getting punched in the junk by snot nosed little shits.
about to start using the word "shitmixed" more often
thankfully i'm at the height that i can just walk underneath it and slap the bars with my hands amd say that i did it
okay but there's a difference between a kid breezing through a v3 or something and doing a v15+...
out of curiosity, seeing as women are lighter than men does that mean that women are as good, if not better than men at rockclimbing?
you got shit on because you're downplaying her crazy intense skill level. she's not just climbing stuff any other child climber can do, she's doing stuff that is literally the hardest stuff ever completed by humans. it's like michael phelps destroying world records but someone's in their telling everyone it's not impressive because he's got longer arms and legs than the average person... while that's advantageous, it certainly doesn't make phelps any less of a crazy impressive legend at swimming.
the funny thing is, i felt more earthquakes the last two years i lived in kansas than i have for the almost year i've been in cali
people also regularly asked if it was ice and how it's made.
most people don't learn f=ma. it seems like common knowledge to us, but it isn't as common as you'd think.
crocs seem to be a good source of natural dad power. now imagine what powers he'd have if he had a polo shirt
if i ever do something like that, i could be content in knowing i did something right with my life.
or if you cropped it it looks like he just runs up and suplexes that kid like a savage. anyone who knows how to edit these things please make that happen.
why did you say "human" like you don't fall under that heading?
and power too. damn kids are like spider monkeys.
i love that half the internet has seen this random obscure harry potter render.
pssh one year. we don't get big ones very often. we really haven't had a noticeable quake in the last year.
this doesn't seem like an odd question to me as nearly every ice skating rink nearby where i live is made primarily of a solid polymer synthetic ice material with very little actual ice laying over top of it. seems like an honest question when you know a lot of ice skating rinks aren't made from just frozen water.
sitting in a room right now with the biggest windows in my house. sad thing is that the blinds have never been opened in the past 7-8 years. i'm starting to think i should change that.
well, once i was casually browsing in a supermarket, when an apple rolled out of the bunch of apples on display. it was at my side, so only on the periphery of my senses / eyesight. however, somehow my reflexes kicked in, and my hand involuntarily shot out and caught that sucker before it hit the ground. i think of it as a movie scene, and the apple is a very unstable ball of explosive, and we're in a very delicate situation, and lara croft is my sidekick, and sees me catch that thing before it hits the ground and destroys all of us, but mainly me and lara. then her pussy gets really wet for me and a lot of the rest of the movie is me and her shagging like our plane is going down.
that "dude" totally failed the turing test. nice catch human teammate.
it's telling you it's not secure because you changed the domain but left the https instead of changing it to http (as the second site doesn't have an ssl certificate). this doesn't mean much of anything, just that you made a request for a secure site (by typing https), didn't get one (because no ssl) and the browser flagged it accordingly. reddit itself *does* have a certificate which is why it's https by default.
damn, you can straight up see that moment where he almost bails but his brain decides to go for it and be a hero. good on him.
undertaker threw that gay swan meme off the top of hell in a cell.
quadriplegic here. 31yrs in. 19yr old son. the old fashioned way. no doctors involved for the deed. yes, there was a blood test. doc's said less than 10% of my sperm was active. i just kept busting nuts until i got me one. congrats to you and yours.
i worked in a rehab facility and had a patient for like 6 months. one day he comes rolling out of his room, looking for me, and when he found me he yelled "it works! it works!" no other explanation needed, just gave him a big high five. congrats to the couple, what a great photo.
do paraplegics feel orgasms? guess i'm going to google it.
girl here...and all i see is the girls hair! that is the most gorgeous hair i have ever seen. what does she do to it? and congrats to them!
she said she loved him and that it was his baby. but alas, it was a paralyze.
that baby will never appreciate how difficult it is to find a parking space at costco on the weekends.
i really admire that guy and his fiancee. i'm afraid l'd be a real cynical asshole about being paralyzed. to see someone so happy and living their life like that boggles my mind in a positive way. kudos.
does he get a boner or was it artificial insemination? honest question. congrats.
on one hand he won't be able to fully play and interact with his child like a normal dad can, but on the other hand who the fuck cares because they can skip all the lines at disney world.
serious question.... after a 5 second review of your comment history, i see you comment a lot on xbox forums. how do you game without using your arms?
i'm paralyzed. i told maybe like 2 ex girlfriends and 5 normal friends when i got my shit to work finally. its like flying an airplane blindfolded only using a jerkoff stroke on the joystick. you don't realize how much your top head controls when your bottom head blows
i guess it would depend on how far below the waist they are paralyzed. if he can still have sex, i assume he can feel it.
i had to look it up again, orgasms are pretty low on the spine s2-s4 (basically the bottom of the spine) and erection is a little higher t-11-l2 (right above where most people get lower back pain). although, you could orgasm through other neuropathways just that these are the most common.
injury level. t anything is torso nerves. l is lumbar lower, you may get bowel and bladder back. sexual function is a godsend.
much like her husband, about the only thing she uses is head & shoulders.
looks like a 1 1/2 inch curling iron rolled to half way up and then brushed out
spinal cord injury paraplegic here. you'd be surprised what you are capable of when it happens to you. i always thought the same thing. 4.5 years later, i'm no less happy than your average american.
it's kind of like putting a cooked noodle through a keyhole.
haha well i wasn't there to witness the act, but based on the writing on the wall i'd assume it was all natural ;)
my first time experiencing orgasm after my accident went like this.. my gf at the time was riding the shit out of me.. i was 18yrs old (2yrs after my accident). as she was going all cowgirl on me, i started to feel that feeling when youre reaching that point where you cant hold back. it was new to me, being paralyzed and while this shit felt good, i had no idea what was happening so i pushed her off of me. i shot a rope stronger than i ever had when walking -- got her right in the eye. i guess that 2yr backup was eager to get out. lol.. we both laughed, i hugged her like i'd never let go... then, right there naked on the bed, i proceed to call everyone in my family. aunts, uncles, parents, grandparents to tell them what i could do. it was 6am. lol edit for context: i'm a full c6 quad. no feeling recovered since my accident 31yrs ago.
not a risky click at all, since i knew exactly what this was going to be as soon as i saw the original comment.
they can get erections from thoughts, touch, but they don't feel orgasm exactly. only 10% ejaculate.
i thought it was the other way around. erection is parasympathetic and it uses sacral pathways. but ejaculation is sympathetic and it must be using thoracic neurons.
wow, please don't edit your damn post thanking people. it's perfect the way it is.
2 months in and someone already posted comment of the year. you guys can go home now.
someone please /r/bestof this. this has to be in the top half of comments i've ever seen.
step 1 complete, but what's step 2 for nice hair internet stranger?
you know, as an indian, i did not think at all that she was indian until you mentioned it.
one of my roommates is indian and her hair is so big and long and voluminous it's so beautiful. i'm white and mine is just really long and flat :/
so what you're telling me is that you have crippling depression and existential dread?
i went to high school with him. was a great guy, haven't seen him in ages but it appears his attitude on life hasn't changed!
my dad says, "it's like trying to shoot pool with a rope."
so basically for guys they just suck your junk with a vacuum
can you do me a favor and ask them? thank you, looking forward to hearing back from you.
but don't you need nerves to tell blood vessels to open or constrict?
i'm glad you were able to have a family. i can't imagine how pleased you were. i'm really interested in how (and exactly which, i hear c5, etc. a lot) breaking these bones in this region seem to cause instantaneous paralysis? as someone who does "extreme sports" (but always wears a helmet) i just want to become more knowledgeable to try and protect myself as best i can.
i needed to give gold to you for saying that thank you
wow, please don't edit your damn post thanking people. it's perfect the way it is.
i am actually crying from laughter. thankfully i was already sitting on a toilet or i may have shit myself. savage.
yep, at least a bit into pregnancy and throughout it. i always thought it was from all those good prenatal vitamins.
fine, i'll say it since no one else will come forth. from one guy to another, nice tackle man. also congrats on the extensive recovery. you are a lucky dude.
damn man. you are one tough fucker. you should be proud of yourself. i cannot even begin to imagine your road to recovery and wish you the best. nice weenie
hey man, i'm not the guy in the picture but i have a spinal cord injury. mine is up in my neck, so i am a quadriplegic, not a paraplegic. but, to answer your question, i can't finish. i don't 100% know about that guy, it all depends on his injury level and severity. if if i was to have a kid i would have to get a doctor to help but everything still works other than finishing.
you'd think so but actually erections happen due to the action of an enzyme telling the entrance to the cavernosal bodies to loosen. don't quote me though.
a lot of times, the breaking of the bone causes nerve damage to the spinal column. every nerve in the body is connected to the spinal column. if the spinal cord is cut during the break, then the communication between nerves is shut off. sometimes it can heal and you can regain function. depending on how badly it's damaged, then you'll be more paralyzed than if it's a more mild injury. i recently learned about the different kinds of paralysis in my low-incidence disability class. basically, there's different degrees of paralysis. you can be quadriplegic like the other person in this thread and still have pretty good functioning in your arms or legs. you just don't have the functioning level of someone without paralysis. in quadriplegia, all four limbs are affected, but there's a second scale, the severity scale, that describes how badly the functioning is impaired.
new reddit rule: you can't say something is meta without linking to what makes it meta. unfair to all us plebs.
thanks man. i just hate to see something that's probably about to become reddit history be all fucked up like that.
you have no idea the struggle with irony i'm dealing with over here. *must not edit post!!!!* seriously though if the person wanted you to thank them they wouldn't gild anonymously or they'd just tell you like /u/theanonymous227 did. it's all good though, if we can save this one post then my job here is done.
does anyone actually use reddit when they're not sitting on a toilet?
a curling iron is kinda like a flat iron. it's a round heat appliance that you curl your hair around. the heat makes the curl stick. source: sister made me a pretty prince(ss) once :)
hahaha - thank you so much. and here i thought my valentine's day would be devoid of any such compliments. i am a lucky dude indeed.
jesus, that's like something an evil genie would grant.
thanks for the reply. so you can get an erection but can't finish? i have to admit i'm a bit curious and have a few questions. what was it like having someone try to make you orgasm? if you can get an erection it seems there is still activity down there. do you think it could be a mental barrier?
it just looks stupid when you start thanking for the gold.
i'm in bed and it is an absolute fucking disaster in here.
the gold train has no ramps, unfortunately for that guy
"i wish i can last super long in the sack" *becomes /u/mrnillows*
hopefully your sheets are brown, or that shit's gonna stain.
i am an immigrant. my father was murdered in my home country in the late 70's. my mother brought me to the u s., legally, as a child. i went on to serve in the u s. military for nearly three decades, which included tours in iraq and afghanistan (twice). during my time in the military i graduated from college with honors and also earned a masters degree. i am now a civilian working professional with a good job, a family and paying a nice chunk in taxes. that's my story in a nutshell.
people complaining that reddit is becoming too political seem to forget that the admins blacked out the entire site in protest of a specific bill being voted on in congress. making a post in opposition of a president's executive order is small potatoes compared to their political actions in the past.
my parents are both iranian. they fled iran (one right at the revolution and one a few years after). my dad came to american and became a doctor. he met my mom who just finished her masters for a teaching degree, specifically for developmentally challenged children. now i exist. if they were banned from this country that wouldn't be the case. my family comes from a muslim background. that being said, they are very against the iranian government because of its extremism. we are increasingly more fearful of the extremist rhetoric that is common place here. i am absolutely disgusted by the way muslims in america are being treated. i know many muslims, or agnostics from muslim countries who are amazing people. many are like my parents. if it wasn't for america's love of freedom i wouldn't exist and we wouldn't have these great contributors who make america the best nation on earth. i am very fearful of our current trajectory.
i hope everyone has a wonderful day. posting this here so there's at least one positive comment in this thread.
thanks for sharing, alexis. my great grandfather was also a refugee from the armenian genocide. he and his family found their way to america through iran. i'm proud to work for a company that will stand up for what is right.
thank you for sharing your grandfather's story. i'm grateful for his sacrifice
i may be remembering this wrong, but wasn't morocco the first country to recognize us independence?
greetings from morocco, i'm pleased to hear that my fellow countrymen have taken good care of you! what's happening is very unfortunate and will have quite a different impact than expected by some people, not only will this further separate us, but the very issue that is currently feared (terrorism) will grow even more because this is exactly the kind of thing that it needs to thrive, just a cycle of pointless hatred. it's almost as if this is deliberate.
i've been trying to get my friends to learn about the entire former yugoslavia mess as a masterclass in how extreme nationalism can go real wrong, real fast.
i cant imagine giving birth in the circumstances your grandmother faced. amazing.
i'm from a small town in the midwest us. i've never known *anyone* prouder to be american than immigrants who have earned their citizenship.
the current anti-intellectualism going on around the country actually reminds me of what happened in cambodia at its most extreme. it is truly frightening that the people in charge are using "alternative facts" and turning their backs on scientific-based facts.
hollywood, please make this movie. i would love to see a story that's not only terrifically exciting, but truly *deserves* to be told.
many jews used cuba as a trampoline to get to the us. until the st louis arrived in havana to find that cuba had forbidden more jewish arrivals because of us pressure to stop serving as a point of transit to america. after several days stuck waiting in the bay (without being able to even come ashore), the refugees were told they had to return to europe. some made it to england from the mainland, but most were caught and killed by the nazis.
that was a dark day for me. i was on the verge of browsing fark. luckily, i stumbled on pornhub first. still, it was a little too close for comfort.
'a nation made of man,' he spoke, 'alike in state and stead - a fond accord of equal folk... except for *you*,' he said.
wow. it just goes to show you that even back then, americans felt strongly that russia sucks, a lot.
wow, i haven't heard this quote before. i had to look it up just to be safe. that was... pretty prescient.
how *dare* lincoln be so *intolerant* and call people who don't think like him "know-nothings"? this disconnect between his elitism and the hard-working confederates is *why the south won the war*. /s just trying to sound like the angry trump supporters on reddit nowadays.
"by the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals. while the people retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years." -also abraham lincoln, first inaugural address, march 4th 1861.
just reading this makes me feel disgusted every time i watch trump & friends try to claim abraham lincoln as their leader, they are a fucken disgrace to him.
thank you. i was moved to tears by your request, one i lovingly embrace and will defend, that this essential aspect of what america represents endures the schemes and fears of lesser men. my earnest hope is that this base attack on our national identity ignites a fire in the hearts of my fellow americans, compelling them to rebuke any order or statute that threatens to smother lady liberty's flame.
i have a very mixed opinion of miltary intervention. on one hand, you end up with people who go off to war and don't totally come back - who have experienced things man was not meant to deal with and whose families must deal with the fallout for the rest of their lives. on the other hand, us militarity intervention is what stopped the holocaust. military force is a necessity - but we must be careful in when and how we apply it. it is too easy to forget that the living are sometimes little better off than the dead.
agreed, growing up in america is great but we take it for granted. the immigrants i know absolutely love this country, and they are so proud to live here.
thanks for this. i love patriotism that comes from the heart. i see way too much "fake" patriotism that is just about waving a flag and espousing stupid ideals. if the world was ending and i was in dire need i would be so happy to have people like you guys on my side.
it's a strange mindset. i've spoken to a number of asylum seekers that are also anti-asylum seeker. you'd think they'd be more sympathetic/empathetic to their cause, having experienced it themselves.
it really is sick. these people put their lives on the line for years in order to protect americans, and now they're being turned away because of where they were born? these people have been lied to. not only does this go against everything america claims to stand for, it's just straight up immoral.
i had to do *work.* it was as terrible as it sounds.
after starting to watch community for the first time ever this past month, i was so excited when i got to that scene, just because this .gif finally made sense.
i am really hoping for a 'it's always darkest before the dawn' situation. i'm probably wrong, but a man can hope...
this. the political process never stops. it doesn't happen just every 4 years or every 2 years. there are always ways to get involved and take action if you want to. the power of technology is awesome. even if there are no elections happening in your state, you can still easily get involved in the political process. and you should.
russia has sucked for as long as sucking has existed - it's why there are so many great poets and writers from russia
i know you were being sarcastic but just in case people don't know, the know-nothings called themselves that.
it's amazing how your perspectives can change when you spend time with people from different backgrounds.
something unique that differentiates the usa from most other countries in history before it is that it was not built on ethnic heritage, imperial borders, or religion. it was built on the social contract and civil society that sought to provide a framework through a constitution for a rational, free people. this has come under threat many times, but it will always be the defining thing that makes americans "americans", not race, religion, or ethnicity. edit; thanks for the gold but go buy a copy of on liberty by js mill instead of wasting your money on the internet
those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it.
my father is a bit of a strange guy. way back in the day he was a huge hippy (met my mom in a commune) and was practically a member of the communist party at one point. he taught in inner-city baltimore, yet has no sympathy for teachers today. he takes a sort of park-and-ride route with a company-subsidized mass transit pass, but opposes funding transit projects. i wouldn't call him an irrational man, but sometimes he lets his feelings cloud his judgement.
they were promised safety! that was the exchange. trump is betraying a decade-old promise just to further his own fucked up agenda. it's madness.
i've got some bad news. you might want to sit down.
"uh, guys...what does a pregnancy test look like?" "it's like a thin piece of plastic with a thing on the end of it." "okay, so this is definitely a gun."
don't worry in a few hundred years captain kirk will come back through from the good timeline, meet up with a vulcan named spock, and turn our dark mirror-verse back to the timeline that it was meant to go on
unless i'm mixing him up with someone else, lincoln actually shared a bed with speed for 4 years and the two became extremely close. this was more common back then, when fathers would share beds with children and other combinations due to a lack of beds. speed offered lincoln his bed after finding that lincoln did not have the money to buy one of his own.
not that they've sucked, but they were the last european country to industrialize, so they are kind of the black sheep of the region. that coupled with the fact that they span two continents are thus are not tied to a particular civilization's culture.
i despise putin, and hate that russia has gone down the path of "cheating" wherever they can - approaching things with the "i'm weak, so how can i cheat my way through this?" attitude. but i hate that because russia is also amazing, full of amazing people who deserve so much better than what they accept. they have some of the positive legacies of the ussr - education and some degree of infrastructure. they have amazing natural resources. i despise their government but very much hope that the people of russia - many ethnicities and religions - can organize themselves to make the russia they deserve. though that's partially selfish - a truly strong, self-developing russia will improve the world rather than dragging everyone else down for relative advantage, as putin is doing now through invasions, sowing discord and lies and with his useful idiots.
i like that it's relevant even without it's meaning.
oh, the "know nothing" party! i read of them years ago. i forgot that. still seems to describe certain wings of anti-intellectual politicians nowadays.
it's so true, i was born in the early 90's in the midst of all of it so i have no idea how life was before then (other than reading about it.) but when i asked my dad and grandma about it, it's exactly how you say it. i asked him if he considered himself yugoslavian or bosnian when he would travel outside of yugoslavia and he said yugoslavian. he also said that religion wasn't discussed much and everyone got along. now it's the complete opposite even decades after the war. trump being president now will affect how bosnia shapes up too with the whole republica srpska and their recent referendum and their threat of introducing a referendum to split from bosnia because the referendum would be supported by russia and presumably russia would influence the us into not intervening and upholding the dayton agreement.
i wonder if that's why big cities tend to be more liberal. you meet a lot of different kinds of people in a town of three million. more than in a town of three hundred, at least.
firstly, i wholeheartedly agree with your statement. but i disagree with your edit, while i'm sure many people could be enlightened by the book you mentioned, getting reddit gold isn't a waste. it provides a way to not only thank contributors on our wonderful forum, but also helps to enable our access to it in the first place. the cost of reddit gold offsets the costs of running the reddit servers, which in my opinion is just one more way of supporting the freedom of us all, by providing us with a free, open, and accessible forum to not only share news stories, pictures of cats, and things we think of while bathing, but also a place to discuss things in a rational and open manner, as well as giving us exposure to new thoughts, mindsets and perspectives.
i think many people just genuinely don't care about the plight of people they don't know. i'm not casting moral judgments, i'm saying this as neutrally as possible. i think a lot of people deep down just really don't care about something until it affects them, because why not? most will probably make an attempt to appear empathetic as a social courtesy, and some won't at all, but many just don't care. a couple days ago my roommate said "why should i care about a few muslims somewhere? it doesn't affect me." although this line of reasoning disturbs me because of how much it conflicts with what i believe, it is a reality for many people.
after about 20, i had to stop reading. forgive me.
all this will fucking do is make more extremist and terrorists. his executive order is just making everything worse, its literally throwing fuel on the fire. i dont get it.
a decade old promise made by the a gop administration as well. he's abandoning our collaborators and making sure that no one else will work with us in the future, which means that our entire method of warfare in this type of situation is compromised. he has done more damage to our own military strategies with this order than any number of 'enemy combatants' ever could.
no no, paul ryan is going to send a free and open internet to a nice farm upstate! he's also going to send your cousin with als there. ...maybe a few muslims. they'll all be happy and play games and maybe do a little work and be free!
it never really felt like donald glover was given the best jokes community had to offer. he would take a joke that regularly would get a smirk from me and just sell the hell out of it and make me lose it. his timing and delivery perfect.
oh it really does. that whole show and especially that episode are fucking *brilliant*.
doesn't that lead to earth being enslaved by the bajorans and cardassians?
i'm sure it was also a warmth issue as well, i grew up in a house that had a wood stove in on room, and a gas stove in another (aka no central heat), and my bedroom was on the second floor. it got really damn cold at night during the winter, i slept with a ton of quilts and blankets, and my bedroom was above the room with a wood stove, so it was relatively warm.
i bet those kind of relationships were way more common back then than we'd expect.
i more meant that the systems of government have always been oppressive to the point that - for most people - life in russia has sucked since time immemorial. i recommend you read some dostoyevsky to get an idea of pre-soviet life.
no one have pointed out that russia sucks more than the russians.
putin could have led his country into an open alliance with europe and established a lasting world order that doesn't rely on grinding people into the ground for stability. instead he decided to dismantle the part of the world that was making progress in that direction. it's a tragedy for the world.
basically the exact same thing as now identifying yourself as an "anti-intellectual". essentially "i'm an idiot and proud of it!"
they didn't call themselves that because they were anti-intellectual, it's because in their early days as a radical anti-immigration group, when questioned as to the motives of their party, they replied "i know nothing", and thus, the know-nothings. the name eventually stuck, which isn't very good branding to be honest.
my 5 yr old daughter has the whitest skin, most freckly nose, light brown hair and aqua eyes. her best friend in the whole world is the most beautiful sudanese girl. they've been besties for 2 years now. their school is the most culturally diverse i've ever seen. i am so grateful my kids grow up with africans, indians, asians, europeans, whose families are from all different countries, but they are all now aussie. i believe it's this generation of kids growing up now that will change the world...for the better.
i live in a town of less than 300. its a 20 minute drive to a town of 900. everyone around here is a gross fat fucking racist blob of shit, a couple cheeseburgers away from reaching critical mass and colapsing in on themselves taking everyone with them.
yeah that's been my harsh realization of being an adult. as a teen i was like "oh we know this shit already and we are all moving toward progress and being better people."
bannon is a christian dominionist who wants a holy war.
how about i come over there and pound you like a boy, that did not come out right...
i felt they all got pretty good lines except shirley perhaps
yes. one of my top three favorites. meowmeowbeenz is another and the one where abed makes a meta movie.
and there's also the fact that he probably was sexually attracted to men in a time when it was even less permissible to be open about it.
there is actually interesting anthropological stuff on the rise of awareness of homosexuality and the decline in male-male intimacy. when everybody pretending that same-sex sexual contact wasn't happening (even though it definitely still was) men were comfortable being physically intimate with each other in non-sexual ways and even speaking of their friendships in almost romantic ways. when gay people started demanding to stop living in the shadows and having to hide who they were, the straight men got terrified of being lumped in with them, both because of prejudice and because the suspicion on being gay put someone's life in serious danger. all that intimacy became frightening, which leads us to where we are today. i feel like we're starting to come out of it, but only just.
i figured if i was going to post the comment, i'd see if it was there. it wasn't. so i created it, because speed, bro.
indeed, russia has a time honored tradition of ruthless dictators/kings
of course it is. you do realize the vast majority of the general public, and *especially* the american public, literally has no clue how prescient, precise, and well-reasoned the work of marx is, right? and that, moreover, he was hardly alone in his devastating critiques of capitalism?
well, no. the name came from the group being secret. if a member was asked about it, they "knew nothing"
could that dude be any more on point from a couple centuries away.
i think it was denmark, where they (were planning?) state subsidized vacations into other countries for young people as a means against xenophobia.
for everyone reading who is turned off by this vitriol, just imagine being forced to read the worst subreddits every day. that's what being in a small town of racists is like, except worse because you have to look and listen to then. you'd be venting a lot of steam too.
it is always terrifying to realize that all the greatest deeds of the past can be undone by failing to act in the present. the united states has entered a series of crossroads where our character will be tested, where we can absolutely fail, and all the citizens of america will be responsible for any mistakes we make.
i think a ton of folks came of age during a progressive, forward thinking administration and just assumed that "progress" just kind of *happened*. that it was some inevitability of the universe. whelp.
fuck, i wonder how many of us thought that? wonder when i realized i was wrong? definitely this past weekend.
there's a lot of research waiting to be done in porn. i'm not kidding. according to some porn site (pornhub, i believe), the most searched term in the southern us was "milf (mother i'd like/love to fuck." anecdotal, at best, perhaps-- but when you couple it with japan's--a place where pda (personal displays of affection, such as kissing or even holding hands) is taboo--while their porn is big on incest, you have to wonder, what do our social repressions have to do with our expressions? many philosophies and schools of thought will tell you about, "our shadow self, our sub-conscious, our underbelly," and they also say it holds greater influence when we don't face it. but who would fund porn research without backlash? specially if it would reveal a shameful side of our society?
for all those famous political icons who had secret bros on the side. hamilton and laurens, lincoln and speed, and trump and putin.
unrelated with the previous comment, i wanna ask, how are iranian geniuses coping when the recent development?
it has seeped a lot into the culture tbh. russians are weirdly appreciative of strong governments/leaders since the few "democratic" attempts where for the most part failures. even without the propaganda and editing of statistics, putin is pretty popular.
precise? god...that isn't what i remember. i recall getting through das kapital at like 10 pages/hour. shit was *dense*. and had some really weird uses of metaphors. it's been 15 years but i remember something about him comparing people to doors.
if i never heard "cuck" again i would be happy. these alt right assholes sound like 4chan cancer trolls.
this is a misconception from learning evolution i think. we tend to think of evolution as a continuous march forward, a constant progression. and that carries over into how we see the world. but the truth is evolution is simply change, moving in neither direction. and like evolution, the world is constantly changing, not always in a good or bad direction but simply changing and adapting.
my dad is in his deathbed. cancer. he was born in africa. america and it's medicine gave him an extra 12 years of life. he is an american citizen. he told me, he wants to be buried at home...here in america.
i think you forgot france, but at least they finally got it right eventually
i mean, it's not that uncommon for the uprising against a dictator to itself become a dictatorship. the us revolution was more the exception than the rule when it comes to transitions of power. washington could have easily gone the way of napoleon rather than just retiring. we're lucky he was as old and eager to retire as he was.
can you give us some examples that translate well?
and more importantly, two or three generations isn't enough to see any significant change across the entirety of the species.
maaaan, this is the kinda stuff that literally makes my eyes well with patriotic tears. and now our cheetoo-hued, short-fingered vulgarian of a president is trying to take away our greatest asset as a country and the thing that makes me actually somewhat proud to be an american. i'm sorry for your loss and hope you and your father truly enjoyed those extra years of life. sounds like we lost a true american.
too late. it's already been reposted. yesterday and 2 days ago. ;)
especially relevant this year. that clown is creepy.
this is awesome. saw it last year and posted it on my facebook. had no idea where it originated. link to more of your work?
makes me smile every damn time it comes around too.
i've seen this comic before. totally on point. thanks a lot for the post, jim. nice to see the artist / writer getting the fake internet points this time around.
probably gonna get downvoted faster than i can think of a witty analogy, but i actually prefer the funsize snickers, the proportions are all off in the big ones and it just ends up a dissapointing carmelly mess you have to scrape out of the wrapper
no no no, how could you take precious karma from professional redditors? and they had the "so my girlfriend made this..." title ready and everything.
we bought a house last year in a court. i was excited for halloween. turns out that people just walk by our court instead of going in.
apartment complexes, and rich neighborhoods were my stomping grounds during haloween back in the day. get the quick easy full bag in two buildings, then clean up with the full size candy in the wealthy neighborhoods. man, i wish there was adult trick or treating with alcohol.
awww. :( one year i decided to put out a lantern and get sweets ready and stuff, and then spent all night hiding in my room suffering from anxiety every time the door was knocked. doh.
you know they've never even sent me as much as a single fun-size snickers
it stood above us looking looking down with these big red eyes. and i yelled, i said, "what do you want from us, monster?" and the monster bent down, and said, "i need about tree-fiddy."
you are having a near death experience, which inescapably means i must have a near vimes experience. don't mind me. carry on with whatever you were doing. i have a book.
very heroic dead, yes yes. saved the world and all, now get in the bag!
we lived in a condo (limited/no traffic to our door as we lived on the top floor) before buying our house and we were woefully unprepared for the tide of children that swept over our poor front lawn. i was handing out individually wrapped vitamin gumballs while my wife frantically tried to make it to the store to buy whatever candy they had left just so we wouldn't be the house that got 'decorated' later. knock wood, 10 years later and we are still tp/egg free.
one of the coolest halloween experiences i've had was in a court/culdesac. all of the houses came together to make a haunted neighbourhood type thing, and it was the greatest idea ever. the place was filled, and the atmosphere was as halloween-y as you can get. it would catch the eye of everyone who walked by the court, so people would always check it out. you should get together with your neighbours and do the same.
just turn on your porch light and fill a bucket full of your candy. leave the bucket out on your front porch.
this election season needs to end. i read that as autocratichillary....
is this from discworld? i've never read them but this is hilarious and i may need to
what is the name of this font? reminds me of futurama.
i like to leave out an empty over turned plastic bowl on my stoop with a "please take one note" on the door. the trick-or-treaters assume that some candy snatching ruffians took the entire bowl. i go through the night with no doorbell to upset the pooch and never have to worry about buying candy or having a boatload left over. i'm a terrible person, but i've made peace with it.
this is a line of focus my therapist hasn't investigated with me, and i think you might be on to something!!
but the first kid takes it all. might as well leave an empty bowl out.
hey not a bad idea. although i'd feel bad for being so impersonal. provably best i work on my issues and just dont do it at all in the meantime. :p
i was sitting here thinking "what are you talking about thats exactly what they said"
saying a simple thanks warrants a 'holy cow'? where are you from?
yeah, that's sound logic for sure, but i dunno. lazy i guess.
which, as it turns out, is actually the *least* fun size :(
oh, you totally should. some of the best humor + fantasy writing ever. and there's a lot to read. this particular quote is from thud! which was the 30-something-th book. there's separate distinct series within discworld. this is from "the watch" series, and i think it's the 6/7/8th book in that series (iirc).
i have seen what happens in my neighborhood to houses that turn the lights off on halloween. it should be noted that i do not live in a great neighborhood.
should i up vote for honesty or down vote for being a stingy bastard? decisions decisions...
you should also put some empty candywrappers on the ground to sell the effect.
i do this every year and have never had that problem.
they got me through the 2000 election cycle, and then the bush years, and have stood by me ever since.
ok so from a quick google there are a lot of them and no numbering? which do i start on?
i think your joke is more self-deprecating than you intended, not only do you have a tiny peepee but your gf is willing to try every other size and confirm yours the worst.
yo my girlfriend weighed around 328 and went into gastric band surgery around 6. done a little before noon and she is in recovery. everything went great. i have few people to tell around me right now so figured this was a good avenue. i love her so much and she is the best thing that has happened to me.
seriously, buy like 30 of them, and ignore reality for a couple of years. it's a lot better.
i hope i dont live to see that horrible day in history so many years from now
do you want a fat girlfriend? because that's how you get a fat girlfriend.
i want a fun size girlfriend who loves giant snickers bars. but i don't think there's a way to write that thought on reddit without it getting turned around on me.
this is where the welsh must have sent their convict sheep.
see, if this was me, my phone would have been left in front-facing mode and i'd have a nice shot of myself experiencing crushing disappointment.
get a watermark on that friend before it winds up being used as a clickbait picture on facebook telling your auntie that the the rapture is here.
wow, that is incredible! i'm an amateur photographer and i have some cool lightning shots but nothing that cool. not even close lol. congrats on capturing such an amazing picture! keep it up.
whoa - someone actually delivering some quality oc? great pic - more more more!!!
for anyone who's wondering, the reason this worked is because op snapped the shutter at the exact same moment a big natural camera flash went off in the sky. cameras (even shitty ones) can take great photos if there's lots of light
maybe but you definitely filtered & tweaked the shit out of that picture.
as someone who takes a lot of "one in a million" lightning photographs, i'll bet that this is a screen shot of a frame of a video.
i'm really envious right now. such an amazing capture! i mean obviously just catching the lightning without a tripod and a long exposure is a feat in itself. then the composition and colors are freaking spot on awesome.
hey op how did this happen? just saw a pretty sky and decided to take a picture?
i've got this nifty buttplug/camera combo that i like
i dunno, eric down the road has a way better camera than me
are you doing it as a career, or just for funzies? i'm like 3 classes away from getting my associates of visual arts, and am starting to think it's about as useful as a poopie flavored lollipop...
thinking in or around knoxville, tn. i'm pretty sure i saw the same cloud last night.
surely something in that pic would spark some questions.
it's actually not. complete freak accident that i captured lightning. it hadn't lightninged all night, and this was the first one, was honestly just trying to grab a picture of the cloud
i feel like i'm the only person that sees harambe in that orange cloud.
i read in a thread that you should post slightly cropped versions online
degrees in art are only as good as your work. the actual degree means nothing. the only thing that matters is your portfolio.
can confirm. have photography degree. currently becoming a plumber.
i'm dubious. you need a slow shutter speed to get that kind of shot, and while the new iphone might be able to do that, there would probably be some shakiness to make the photo unfocused, unless he had the phone on a tripod.
am i missing something? e: i've reached a whole new level of stupid
the song was inspired by budd dwyer, who shot himself on live tv during a press conference in 1987.
while it's a great photo, it's was more of a well timed shot than a well composed shot.
either you're a shill, or that's a really shitty canon you bought.
no, the only thing that matters is the networking. who you know is more important than a portfolio any day.
pro 'tog here. it's possible to do with a cell phone, i've done it in the past. however, the light trail on the truck doesn't suggest a cellphone's rolling shutter, to me. that says long exposure. i'll admit that i haven't played with the iphone camera, as he suggests it was shot with, but given the crispness of the lightning, and the straight lines of the truck's motion blur, i have doubts that this was shot handheld, or even a cell phone.
or the motorola user who had the sd card corrupted again.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
i'm sure they pay very little, or nothing at all. yes, great photo. but lots of people would be willing to have their photos in an ad without compensation, so they don't really have to pay.
it's because it was the second comment in a row saying the same thing.
not true, i'd wager a majority of reddit uses ios
apparently. remember, everyone must have and prefer the same phone.
one of these days they're going to get to the point where there won't be any artifacts even on a camera. and you'll be able to shoot at a noiseless 819,200+ iso what a glorious day it will be.
sometime you don't have to zoom in to enjoy the sight.
but having a good portfolio will only help sell yourself better. source: professional artist
lol as an artist network will get you nowhere if you're shit
niiiiiiiiiiicccceeeeeee shhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwt
it's the best filter, people have said it's the best, i know so many people that like that filter. i mean look, it's the best there is. people have been saying this for a long time. i've seen it myself. it's a tremendous filter. just look at what people are saying.
except when talking about the *quality* of a picture and comparing it to professional cameras. then it matters quite a bit.
they do though. it's just a matter of practice and learning how to use all the extra settings.
yes. a canon rebel+a 35mm prime will have higher image quality than any phone camera. phones are producing very nice images though, so that's always a plus.
real talk, yes. it's all about the lens. phones don't have optical zoom lenses, which is why the picture quality degrades substantially when you zoom in on your phone. not to mention the fact that you can use a variety of different lenses with dslr cameras.
but that guy said the only thing that mattered was networking? i just got a 5mhz router for my photography business
i own a vive. so... about 50 hours of my life lost to troubleshooting, but all totally worth it.
god dammit that made me laugh outloud at my desk haha. caught an eyefull from my boss.
it is actually. would you care to show me around? or show me some more of this disgusting type stuff..
that's why i say hey man nice reference to a song about r. budd dwyer
not bad, and for them that's like the penny that you lose in the dryer lint.
i can't wait to save up for a dslr with a full frame sensor. only problem after that is the lenses.
also depends where you view the pictures. canon pics and iphone pics will mostly look exactly the same on instagram and facebook.
5mhz ain't gonna push much. maybe you should try 5ghz.
straight to r/watchpeopledie, bud. you'll love it
what you could've taught me i could've saved some face.
i think it's a lot less than a penny to them, relatively speaking.
i bang harder on a 45-dollar konica auto s2 from 30 years ago than anything most people can do with their 2,000-dollar canon. your post is 100% correct. having a beautiful camera is like having a well-endowed penis. it might look good in your hands, but if you don't know how to use it, it ain't worth much.
as one experienced in skyrim modding, that sounds about right.
just gonna avoid that sub and assume your username checks out.
that was pretty cute. can we get a little more disgusting though?
i didn't know it was that easy to fire the acting attorney general.
calling the tweet: 6:45 am jan. 31: obama ag refused to enforce basic law and order! she is fired! my ag sessions needs a vote!!
trump has just canned acting ag sallyyates solely for her legal opinion. this is something so serious that the last time it happened it took down nixon.
people are being fired for trying to uphold justice. this is a giant red flag.
at this point i'm fully expecting trump to tell us the story of darth plagueis the wise.
doing what is right is more important than doing what is demanded. thank you sally for standing up to the bully.
did she die? why am i seeing this? is it a trump thing? did trump do another thing? jesus, i hope he didn't do another thing...
a patriot. you are on the right side of history, now and forever.
is there not a single sub left without political posts?
/r/pics is indistinguishable from /r/politics now.
and this is how r/pics died. seriously screw the posters trying to submit quality images of beautiful scenery, hand made artwork, cute animals or funny situations...lets just make this entire sub another circle jerk for r/politics to consume. "there is no sanctuary."
i hate trump, but honestly i'm starting to get sick of this shit. this is literally just a completely unremarkable picture of the woman. can you just post anything on /r/pics now as long as you can find a picture to tie it to. it's pure shitposting at this point.
jesus christ. is this r/politics or pics? im all for political posts in this sub that the pictures actually provide some cool backstory, this is just ets level bs though.
she was on the way out with a successor being vetted for confirmation. she decided to defy an executive order knowing full well the consequence of her action. now she has added life to her political career. i don't see what the big deal is. if you think the eo was illegal, wiser men than you and i should debate that in the right venue, the court of law. can we ease up on the hyperbole for social media karma?
bernstein and dershowitz both said trump was within his rights to can her. this isn't a saturday night massacre. she didn't even think the eo was unconstitutional, which raises even bigger ethical questions as to her actions.
why the fuck is r/pics now just political shit? this used to be a cool sub, now someone's headshot is making the front page.
do any of you acrually understand what is happening? there are 4 things in the constitution specifically spelled out as the presidents job. first and for most is to secure and defend our borders. it's a 90 day travel ban, so that a better vetting process can be put in place. i'm not saying there weren't some missteps in enforcement but he is trying to do his job and he did say... if elected i will do this. i don't understand the suprise or disgust. if the ag doesn't want to enforce the law then a new ag is appropriate. i didn't vote for him but he's here for the foreseeable future, let him show you were this is going....if you still don't like it then protest til your head caves in. but he is the first potus in recent memory who is serious about protecting our borders. let the down votes begin!
fuck off with all the stupid usa right and left leaning political bullshit. you guys are invading all the other subs like this. who gives a flying fuck about some usa politician. i'm fucken over it.
how do i get all this fucking politics off of my personal reddit page? damn near every sub i'm subbed to from /r/masseffect to now this sub is a political shitshow. please /u/spez end this madness!
you are not allowed to pick and choose what laws you follow. religious still have to issue marriage licenses to gays and people passionate about migrants still have follow current travel freeze.
sally yates: hero, patriot, and faithful citizen sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states of america against all enemies, foreign and domestic. well done, ag sally yates.
you mean she did her job until she refused to do her job and got fired for it?
she did the right thing by refusing to do something she disagreed with, but she should have resigned. either you do what the boss says, or you quit. she chose to refuse, and this is the result.
you're about to learn a whole fuck load of things you never knew about civics and society.
he was gonna get rid of her anyways, but i'm very surprised that he fired her before sessions was confirmed.
that's pretty much what he tweeted a few hours ago
the bomber was eric rudolph, not the security guard richard jewell (who was completely innocent).
she was standing up against all those things. trump's nwo will not allow for any of that. people keep saying no no... don't call him a dictator, but it's been basically a week and his presidency is already looking insanely unstable and shaking our social structures that have basically become unspoken norms at this point. things are going to get much worse before they get better apparently.
that's great, what the fuck is she doing in /r/pics ?
i am sorry. but when you work for the government, your "beliefs" don't mean shit. prime example being that one bitch in kentucky that wouldn't hand out marriage certs to gay couples. kim whateverhernamewas.
i'm pretty sure that trump could murder someone on camera, then the next day claim that it didn't happen or people are remembering it wrong, then his supporters would call it a hoax.
as much as i want to agree with you, the pundits are putting this on her. she fell on her sword willingly. she disregarded a direct order by her boss. her only option was to resign in protest. this move could only result in being fired, regardless of the president. that said, i doubt any other president would fire her so quickly and flamboyantly.
i believe she was canned for not following an executive order. agree or disagree with her cause, the action of willfully disobeying the presidential order is the cause she was relieved. the court had already made an initial ruling.
wasn't it within trump's legal right to issue an immigration ban?
a 3 month ban on immigrants from 7 countries hardly constitutes "crimes against peace and crimes against humanity"
what did she do to stand up to trump? not sarcastic.
i think trump fired her, or whatever presidents do to people in those positions.
first... they came for /r/politics, but i said nothing, for i was not a subscriber...
careful. rational, level-headed comments such as these will get you downvoted to oblivion. tread carefully!
life has been ruined by politics right about now. as annoying as it may be to have our regularly scheduled program of dancing cats and sneezing pandas interrupted what is happening right now is history. when you are old sitting by a fire somewhere your grandchildren will ask you where you were and what you were doing when the world went to shit......
that's not how public service works. first and foremost, you serve the people.
well then, give op an upvote for his/her demonstrated psychic ability.
the odd thing is that he is saying that the democrats do nothing but obstruct, uh didn't the republicans obstruct obama for 6 years? yeah...funny how the roles are reversed now
stop with the nwo crap, trump is part of wwe, not wcw
trump just fired her for "betraying the department of justice".
i think this is correct. the attorney general is, above all else, an attorney, and cannot ethically contravene the us constitution. but an attorney's recourse if a client orders them to violate the law is to resign, or to refuse and find out if they get fired. the outcome we're seeing here is the expected one. the only trumpy part is the whole screeching about betrayal thing. a real president would have done this with class.
but it was also because she believed that it was a violation of legal precedent and was in agreement with all of the circuit judges that issued stays on the executive order.
she might have been fired but she can hold her head high knowing that today she took a stand for the country and not for party. the constitution over tyranny.
the job of the attorney general is to be a lawyer for the government, not to follow the commands of the president. the attorney general is part of the dept of justice and one of the checks and balances between the three branches of government. she was absolutely doing her job.
the courts have also ruled that just because something is legal, doesn't make it legal. if trump signed an eo tomorrow saying you could steal from walmart without anything happening, still illegal. it's morally wrong. there's quite a bit of precedent. look at the nuremberg trials. look at the border guards in berlin. what they did was completely legal but they were later tried and sentenced.
had security grab her by the pussy and escort her off the premises? i'm guessing that's how it works under this administration.
they serve at the pleasure of the president, but they are also impartial. the two are not mutually exclusive.
the doj is an executive department; the ag can be ~~hired and~~ fired at the president's will. this is part of the president's core article ii powers.
so how did kennedy making his brother ag fit into that?
we bitched about it 24/7 when they did it, are we really ok with our hypocrisy?
which is sound legal advice and exactly what her job requires her to do.
there is no check on the executive branch *within the executive branch.* the eo is shit, but this is basic stuff.
that is not true. the attorney-general serves at the president's pleasure and is part of the executive branch of government - i.e., the same branch as the president. she is not, and is not intended to be, a check on trump's power.
you obviously don't know what checks and balances are, since the department of justice is part of the executive branch.
dude, you sound like you got the right amount of seething rage to call a motherfucking senator or five about impeachment.
definitely saved lives. i think it was probably made worse by the fact that rudolph wasn't identified/suspected/caught for such a long time afterward. people forgot about the story but remembered poor richard jewell
seriously, even back then the media frenzy could destroy an innocent person's life but imagine what would happen now
actually there's a good argument to be made that his temporary ban on non legal residents is totally legal. while his order was over broad (involving those with established legal residence) his temporary travel ban itself seems to be in keeping with the executive's control over certain factors of immigration policy.
we're not debating the potus's power to do so, just that a good potus wouldn't do so.
you didn't contradict the person you're responding to. they said their job is to uphold the law. your response is that she holds her position at the behest of the president. but those aren't mutually exclusive and doesn't address the fact that the al's job is to enforce the law.
you do realize that checks and balances can occur within a branch of government and aren't entirely reserved for across branches?
just tried to call my senators and leave a message, their mailbox is full.
your answer contains the answer then. if his order, which included permanent residents, was deemed too broad, then she has the duty refuse the entire order. unless you want the attorney generals to have the power to follow or refuse parts of these orders selectively, which i don't think any president would want.
then it's not a checks and balances argument. i also think the eo is shit, but the guy i replied to is straight up wrong.
everybody said he wouldn't make it anywhere near the white house...
58 seconds. thats how long it took me to figure out that this was bullshit!!
****watches video**** ****realizes that i've been rick rolled**** ****continues listening to the song****
the fact that creative ways to roll people are still being made is beautiful. i feel like this meme will never end.
ahhhhhhhhhh, took me fucking 20 nevers to realize what you did there.
"huh, 3:33 seems kind of long if you actually speed the track up every time he says "never." was the original really that long?" ***click*** "man, i forgot how *weird* this song and music video were. oh, here we go, it's about to happen!" ***chorus hits*** "wait, how fast are they speeding this up? it must be a really small amount. really small. what the hell, this doesn't sound like it is changing at all! what is going on here!? wait, the title on youtube doesn't mention anything about it being sped up... no... i didn't just... op, you son of a bitch..."  what went through my mind after not realizing what was happening for an embarrassingly long amount of time.
clicked link. first "never" passes. "it didn't sp-..." raucous laughter well played, op.
the vevo watermark should hav ebeen a dead giveaway
what the fuck i am so confused... did i just got ricked rolled or not?
really? for me it was the first second when the vevo mark was there.
i even read the title of the youtube video, which said nothing about increased rate and thought "thats weird, why doesnt it mention that its sped up" and still waited until halfway through the chorus before i figured it out... i am not a smart man
the only clever rick roll i've ever seen. bravo op.
my attitude is i already gave it another view, so might as well ride this sucker out until the end.
it is the closest thing to a classic meme i think. most others go in and out of fashion, but a good rick roll? it's a classic.
gald i'm not the only person who doesn't mind being rick roll'd. the only think better would be take on me roll'd.
i've listened to the whole thing every time i hear it since it first came out. not stopping now.
it needs some more bass and bam its a nightcore remix
god, even if we say it is in fact real, no one will believe it. this is a rick roll paradox.
i didn't know if i could trust this. even the imgur links are rickrolls in here. but it actually checks out! good on you!
1:35 before i figured. this is the first time i've been genuinely rolld
yea. i'm not even mad though. i kinda like this song.
the bacon bits to the shit salad that has been 2016. don't worry though - there's still 28 days for reddit to kill off another major celebrity, so we've got that going for us, which is nice.
i looked at the view count. i was like: "damn, this has a lot of views for a sped up video." then it hit me.
i dunno, were simple beings. side note......my mom in her 50's was pleasantly surprised when i started singing every lyric, to never going give up on the radio in her car last week, shes like do you even know who sings this??? i was like he's kinda a superstar online from this song, then explained to her about rickrolling, but her friends might not understand what shes doing, if she tried to rickroll them.
you must've missed the one a few years ago where someone posted a link saying that the rick astley video got taken down, and the link was the video. now that, that was a clever rick roll
fool me once, shame on, shame on you. fool me, you can't get fooled again.
i won't lie, i always finish this song when someone links to it.
it's because rick rolling becomes funnier as time goes on.
same. out of respect for rick really. it's not his fault the song became a meme. i want him to know the joke involves him, it's not on him. besides, hes got a great voice.
i came here to say that after the first chorus it could have been nightcore
rickrolling is only funny if the only person doesn't expect it. by clearly linking to a video that looks like a rickroll, the video now can't be a rickroll because that wouldn't be funny. also you can just skip to 2/3rds of the video to check.
first and only time for me. i've been so goddamn careful. this is some evil-genius, inception-matrix level rick-rolling. or, i'm an idiot.
2016 was fine. there wasn't even a world war. yet.
thank god for res. reddit links shouldn't have video expandos.
this is what everyone on the internet needs to do. teach their parents about it so that it stops becoming cool for younger people to do it sort of like we did with facebook.
eiffel 65 is going to be so disappointed to hear that
fun fact: the lowest note in the song is "take" at the beginning of the chorus and the highest note is "two" at the end of the chorus - they're over two and a half octaves apart.
what *is* nightcore? i just looked some up on youtube and it's all anime.
i looked at the running time and knew this was a hoax. everyone knows the song is 3 minutes and 32 seconds normal speed. everyone
how the fuck did i dodge the first two, then fall for that?
i've never seen this video before and just watched the whole thing....it was amazing.
this was everything i hoped it would be. also never knew how much i wanted to hear alvin and the chipmunks do rick astleys greatest hits.
wait, is nightcore one guy/group, or is it a whole genre?
did the crowd just rickroll themselves? geez, the greatest troll is rick astley himself.
at about 0:50 it started sounding like one of those catchy kpop songs
thank god i saw your comment first, because i'm honestly sick of that peyton manning shit. rick astley on the other hand, i'm always happy to get rick roll'd.
i dated a girl who said she saw a t shirt she thought i'd like then showed me a shirt with that on it. i asked her what the hell that meant and she said it was reddit's "callsign" i told her to please never get me that shirt.
that's peyton manning? why the hell do people keep posting it? i keep seeing this pic but know nothing about it...
"i have no fear of losing my life - if i have to save a koala or a crocodile or a kangaroo or a snake, mate, i will save it." *steve irwin.*
his kids are growing up and following in his footsteps! what an amazing guy.
the day he died was the day i realized my idols were just as human as me. sad day it was.
i remember my 11 year old self was so distraught after learning from the news of his passing... he was a hero animal lover that i admired much so.
i remember how i reacted when i saw on the news that he died. i cried like a baby... i was 9
why he wasn't printed onto an australian banknote i have no clue. fucking legendary cunt he was.
one of my biggest regrets was not taking an internship at his zoo when i was 20 or so around 20 years ago. but my grandma got cancer so it wasn't a difficult decision. but i would pull the acceptance letter out once in a while for a long time, especially after he passed.
very few of us can say that we knew him personally but, i think the man's character made us feel like we did. imho that is a great compliment.
there have been two celebrity deaths in the past 20 years that really upset me when they happened - his was one (bowie was the other, but for different reasons obviously). in this age of vapid celebrities, he wasn't that type. i think he was one of the few who actually deserved his celebrity, was a celebrity for the right reasons and did a lot of good in the world. he taught people that animals that are venomous or generally thought of as being dangerous and of no benefit to society should be respected; not killed, saved or relocated when necessary and appreciated for their unique beauty and place in the world. i know it changed my thinking about how to handle such animals when in close proximity to humans. it was so sad was for the world to lose someone who showed such positivity, love of his chosen field and of nature. i can only image how sad it must have been for his family.
he taught me the difference between an alligator and a crocodile. rip!
this guy would have been the president of australia by now. does australia have presidents?
wow it's crazy how time passes by so quick it's been 11 years already.
til steve irwin was only five years older than kurt cobain
this man made the discovery channel. i miss when i could spend my winter break as a child learning about the world through his eyes. he shared nature in the way children do but as a grown man, which sounds simple but it is incredibly rare and powerful. i miss what he brought to television, nature and the world. furthermore i am saddened by what the channels he made great have become...
i had to be 9 when he passed and it was all over the news. can anyone tell me about mr irwin? sorry if i spelled his name wrong :/ i don't really know much about him tbh
i saw his young son on tv yesterday and he is the spit of steve he has the same manner and everything i think he will be just as popular as his dad r.i.p
"crocodiles are easy. they try to kill and eat you. people are harder. sometimes they pretend to be your friend first." -steve irwin
what a nice guy, i hope his legacy lives on for a long time.
the man lived and died doing what he loved. a short life filled with passion and love is better than a long life void of each.
steve irwin lived as he died; with animals in his heart.
at least there's the silver lining that he didn't live to see one of the most influential nations in the world give up on saving the environment.
people never knew that side of steve irwin. lovely quote btw.
every time a video shows up on reddit (with either kid) there are always snide comments mentioning how fake they seem, and how they're under pressure to be happy, etc. almost like, *i don't believe someone can be that happy after their father was taken from them unjustifiably.* well, let's not forget that they were extremely young when their father passed. but what's really sad to me, is that so many people can't even believe that you can be as happy as the happy-blood that runs in their family. it's rare, sure. but i find it to be genuine, and intoxicating. i also go to the dog park, and don't own a dog, so there is that.
yeah i saw a post earlier today about it! i hope his kid gets his own show too.
i feel like once the world lost steve everything started to go down hill. of couse statistically crime and overall human suffering has also gone down in general. but the worlds a little less fun without the crocodile hunter out there.
it could also be an empowering thought. if your idols are humans, just like you, you can aspire to be like your idols.
i don't really follow main stream celebrity going-ons, but when steve died i was absolutely *devestated*. such a passionate animal lover.
my parents intentionally hid it from me because they knew i'd be devastated. i wrote him letters every week and he sent me a signed shirt for my birthday that i have cherished ever since.
i wonder if steve irwin used "cunt"as often as the average aussie seems to in his off camera life...
i know, 44, right? now that i'm 27, that feels so young. so much accomplished in those few years, the whole world respects him for his passionate nature.
you could probably always try to volunteer at the zoo. it's at least a step in that direction~~ :)
he has a weird fiction movie where he and his wife are spies that was on netflix last time i checked. do yourself a favor and watch it if it's still there
yeah, it reminds me how i have achieved nothing in 11 years.
i was thinking the exact same thing! i think it's because kurt died so young that i never thought of his actual age.
you need to go watch old crocodile hunter shows. he would pretty much put his face into the faces of deadly animals, called them a "beeeaut", maybe poke their heads a couple times for the camera, explain something cool they do and move on to the next animal.
did you see his son on fallon? his legacy lives on through his children, which is fantastic
haven't heard that one in... gee i don't know, every discussion with the name "irwin" anywhere and everywhere any time, place dimension and/or alternate realities. so not long.
this is literally posted on every single post involving steve irwin since he died years ago.
but...he also isn't around to fight against it either :(
what the us is doing now under trump's presidency is fucking disgraceful... but we have been doing the same thing to other nations lands as well and australia has been destroying it's own reefs for oil. it's all fucked, it's not just the us now. it's the us and every nation for 80 years
i respectfully disagree -- the man clearly held animals very dear to his heart. if you were to ask me, while steve was alive, if he would step in front of a car to save a crocodile, i'd answer yes.
no one knew that he cared deeply for animals? pretty sure thats the vibe you instantly got.
bindi was definitely old enough to remember her dad, i remember her speech at his memorial. robert was like 2 at the time and definitely doesn't except for maybe vague memories. but you're right, that pisses me off too. both have grown up at the zoo, with people who treat them like family. their grandpa bob who as far as i know is still alive loved animals just as much as steve. bob and his wife opened what is now the australia zoo in the 70s. terri still owns the zoo. those kids have literally grown up with animals, with people who had just as much passion for animals as their dad, i think bindi had kids shows when steve was still alive even. animals are in their blood so to say they don't have as much passion for animals is ridiculous. they do their own shows at the zoo and are very comfortable talking. they are clearly passionate about what they're doing. i don't get why people are cynical. i am happy we have two amazing people to carry on what steve started.
yea i never understood that. those who make those comments are basically saying that the kids should be depressed and hiding in their rooms all day long over it. they should probably realize that faking it or not, following their father in his footsteps is extremely admirable.
your last line made me smile. last year i went to the park with my little pup (he's 9, but he's still my pup), and there was an older woman there. he ran up to her and was basically saying hi like a dog. she reached into her purse and gave him a treat. i asked her which dog was hers. "oh, my dog passed last year, i just like to come and be around all the dogs as a way to relax." it was one of those moments that caught me off guard, and i remember here and there randomly. she seemed so content to be there, just sitting on a bench handing out milk bones.
they probably are happy, but they're also told to put on a little bit for the audiences. and, as children, they're not that experienced so their enthusiasm comes off as a bit disingenuous.
makes me kinda want to cry. that kid is so awesome.
we should go find that stingray and beat the shit outa it
yea but as a kid i always thought he was invincible. i wanted to meet him when i got older.
i just remember thinking of all the crazy, fucked up shit he did, i sting ray is what did him in. i couldn't believe it for the first few days.
interestingly enough, they say if he didn't pull the barb out there was a high chance he'd of survived.
those years... 10 years ago? you make it sound like 2006 was the 90's!
if that happens i'm going to get myself australia money just to have that. the exchange rate with the canadian dollar is just as terrible so i wouldn't even be losing any money.
i'm 41 and own a business now. in the us. that time is past me i'm afraid.
crocodile hunter: collision course. i don't see it on netflix in the us but definitely a fun movie!
instead you've got one of the least environmentally conscious governments in a while right?
well, you don't actually vote for the prime minister in australia, but the sentiment is the same.
his son is the spitting image of him, right down to his mannerisms and the way he explains things. so cool to see.
i didn't even know that he has a son till the other day. i only thought that he had a daughter. was very surprised and happy to find this information out. god i miss that man and all that he had done to educate us on wildlife. another great soul is jack hannah . i met him at a show and he was taking pictures with anyone that asked. they ran out of press photos, that they were giving away for free, and jack wrote down every persons address that didn't get one and sent a signed photo of him, personalized. my 8yr old daughter was so happy to get that in the mail from him. with her name on it. back to steve, today is his moment. thanks steve for all that you have given us.
the joke was good for the first 10 years. its getting fucking old yet people still guild it. might as well throw out some "thats what she said" jokes and try my luck for some gold
damn, that hits hard. i'd like to think that steve's sheer irwin-ness would convince trump into saving the environment and the wildlife that inhabit it.
the accident occurred while filming for his daughters show, if my memory serves.
those people want his kids to be as bitter and lonely as they are.
i'm laughing so incredibly hard at myself right now. i read that whole story as if your "pup" was your human child.... i had to read it twice. don't mind me, i'm an idiot.
i was just thinking he was basically superman to me growing up
if any event ever tarnished the reputation of an animal, it was this. totally prejudiced against sting rays now.
i remember trying to rationalize it, "well... it was a matter of time." -- and i actually stick by that idea, and i think he knew it too... but he was doing what he loved.
i used to think sting rays were cool, now i go to the aquarium and just want to start a fight.
it is a hard thing to assess. i read that if he left it in there was a big chance his heart would have ripped to shreds from beating against the teeth of the barb, which would've been an infinitely more painful death
wait... 10 years ago was the '90s... right? right?!
for people who don't remember 9/11, this is probably their most traumatic news memory.
the new 5 is in circulation, and the 10 has been finalised, but 20, 50 and 100 are still available for him.
yep. a piece of coal was brought into the senate recently in order to argue that it more coal power stations should be opened in our country. also did i mention our government preys on the disenfranchised, old, and infirm? like two peas in a pod, the aussies and the us.
much in the same way /r/australia in no way reflects how the nation votes.
i'm so impressed with him. he's definitely his fathers son. the same passion steve had. amazing. both him and bindi have grown into amazing people. continuing to advocate for animals like their father. some people just have "it" ... and he does !
wow. his son is just a doll. he seems to have both his father and mothers most positive qualities.
i think hes trying to emulate steve, more then it being his natural state. nothing wrong with that, steve was an amazing dad and person, you can't blame him.
you don't remember the controversy when he was holding baby bob in one arm and feeding a crocodile with the other?
thats pretty much the same shit that happens to every golden joke on this site, prime examples i've noticed are the "m'laysia" joke on the discussion about malaysian airlines, fucking hilarious at the time, now people apply "m'whatever" to anywhere and get thousands of upvotes and gold, where the fuck is the joke? doesnt even remotely relate to neckbeards at all. another is "to shreds you say", at the time that genius somehow pulled this random quote that no one gave a shit about and turned it into a meme, now people piss it about when harm to somethings comes even remotely close. my gripe is when a great joke comes along try to remember it great by keeping it relative, cant go putting square shapes in round boxes. /rant
i guess "saying hi like a dog" was a weird way to phrase it. i meant, "like dogs will do."
if you ever do, just remember that he wouldn't want you to feel that way. he would hate to hear about someone harming any ray because they were sad or angry of his death. iirc, he died so he wouldn't have to harm the ray in an effort to help himself*
if he doesn't make it on the $100 note i'm gonna be so pissed!
if he hasn't had professional oration training i would be amazed. what charisma!
he really is. i forgot how much i enjoyed terri. maybe she's stayed out of the spotlight since steve's passing? but he has her eyes, and her gentle approach somehow mixed with steve's enthusiasm.
bob is named after his grandfather and is a great kid.
spent an afternoon with him (as well as terri and bindi) at aus zoo a couple years back and i think it is just his natural state. very easygoing, friendly and mature for his age!
kids behave how they are taught. my kids act, very much, like my husband and i...speech patterns, points of enthusiasm/interest/irritation...
i don't think he's emulating him on purpose. there's probably so much expectation and pressure from people around him to be like steve. he unconsciously ends up talking and acting like him. nothing wrong with that, it's very natural.
honestly... it wasn't that. from the very beginning. i even quickly thought, "how cute, referring to his/her child as pup" and, i completely prefer dogs to kids, i don't know where my brain was going with that one.
i'd prefer him on the 50 myself, when was the last time you saw a hundred dollar bill? exactly.
fucken' oath, fuck the queen whats she done for our culture? fuck all!
terri was in the news lately for allegedly shacking up with russel crowe but that's mostly it since his death and bindis various franchises.
steve's dad?? damn, pretty heavy name.. looks like a great kid to carry it on.
lost my dad when i was young. didn't know him all that well for several years growing up, just memories of a certain time. photos and distant memories are all i had. this kid has his father's legacy, youtube videos, people's adoration of his father etc.. believe me, he's emulating his dad. never underestimate a sons need to do this. as you say not a bad thing, but this kid has probably felt inclined and encouraged to keep his dad's "spirit" alive.
yeah but people on the gc tend to be pretty fucking retarded.
as a new zealander i was just happy we were included on the map.
genuinely thought this was r/news and the news stations have finally lost it
sigh, that's what my inner monologue said when i clicked on that link. well played.
it has been crazy the past few days. it seems like something fairly significant happens pretty much twice a day. hard to process it all, it's like rapid fire newsfeed.
what the... this legitimately scared me. it's perfect. my first reflex was some kind of shooting or another terrorist attack. fuck, man.
this is pretty much my first thought when i see "breaking news" "what the fuck happened this time?"
happy to see something on the lighthearted side about politics. been crazy the last week.
april fools day this year is gonna be so confusing. "wait.. that's a lie.. right? fuck. trump is really ordering for more nukes to be produced??"
i bet it's a really boring night in the alternate reality where hillary is president
basically, the same thing i think to myself every time i hear the atrocious words, "president trump."
not trying to get too political on this sub, but doesn't this kinda feel like the plan? it's how trump's campaign felt and it feels like they're going with the same strategy: exhaust your opponents.
trump just fired everyone on the east coast and west coast and anyone in between who has a college degree or higher.
i would watch a station that used this graphic lol
it's like rapid-fire trashcan diarrhea. you can't stop it from happening, and you can't get a break to get help, but by god you'll carry that trashcan around with you in case you have to shit in front of your neighbors.
that's intentional. he figures we'll suffer outrage fatigue or we'll miss some shit he's pulling.
well, tomorrow we have the potential vote to confirm sessions, and trump's supreme court nominee, in addition to whatever surprises the administration has in store. trump did say he was a ratings machine!
as an aussie you're not the only one. i know it's terrible but i can't help but watch in morbid fascination at the same time. i imagine the experience for americans is somewhat less enjoyable.
dude, i have a confession to make... i stopped wishing for things to get better some time ago and now i just want the fast track to armageddon. i'm not even religious, so i gotta start shopping around for cheap rapture packages.
or trump again, but it is 2am where he is so not much happening in trump land!
''aliens come to invade the earth and instill a new world order'' ''oh, thank god. i thought trump launched a nuke''
nah, it will just be the reverse of all previous afd's, and will likely contain headlines like "trump resigns", "trump hospitalized after coronary", or "impeachment proceedings begin at 10:00 am", in other words stuff that everyone would want to hear and would latch onto in about 18 or 19 nanoseconds.
i popped over to this universe to let you know that our top headline is "bill has decided on a name for the new white house cat"
i hate living in the interesting times timeline. imagine if climate change was being addressed, clean energy solutions rolled out, vaccines safely allowed to be effective, scientists being listened to, etc.
the upside is that i'm really enjoying the nicknames. mango mussolini is fabulous.
yeah, more pics of someone holding a sign next to another lefty person holding a sign and just to mix it up, a picture of my friend protesting.
so i'm a reasonably well educated american, and i still have no idea what the fuck part of the globe that is. i see that abstract florida-cuba thing up in the right corner, then i get confused about what color is the land and what is the ocean. that dick-looking thing in the upper left should be norway or sweeden or finland, whichever of those is the dick, but in that case new zealand wouldn't be on the map. right now i'm leaning towards white being land and red the sea, but fuck if i know.
it almost looks like something the daily show or john oliver would do. "and now, on to our new segment, appropriately titled: *oh fuck, what now?*"
i always see a coca-cola can when i see this graphic.
over night! so much could happen! i drove for three hours yesterday and a terror attack happend on my country (canada). if you blink you'll miss the next five shit shows
more than 7 billion people in the world. tonight, more than a 100 people will attempt to shove a toy car up their ass. with great numbers, comes great probability.
it feels like 9/11 in slow motion. like they adapted the movie into a tv series.
i smell a business idea. tired of searching for that toilet when you desperately need it? introducing the shit can! the portable trash can you can use on the go! and it's easy to clean...
like replacing the joint chiefs of staff with bannon on the nsc on saturday following the immigration ban
i am exhausted. multiple times a day there is more horrible news. we have no idea where this is headed or how to stop it. i cry in fear for the little 3 year old girl that sleeps in the room next door.
i'm an iranian-american woman (born and raised here in the us). i live in a very, very conservative state. it's hard to describe how i'm feeling right now. i feel so helpless, afraid, and angry. i feel a huge sense of injustice, and frustration at the number of people who claim that people like me are all terrorists. i feel scared for what the future looks like, not just for immigrants, but for women, lgbt people, and other minorities. i'm also scared of the idea of trump starting a war, especially with iran. i don't want my family living there to be carpet-bombed. :( i just feel hopeless.
well, it's been normalized. quebec just had a terrorist attack, and instead of shedding a tear, everyone went at each others throats hoping the killer supported their awful agendas
i'm gonna assume this guy is very young. sure, when i was a kid i'd get a burst of excitement when there was some sort of breaking news and think to myself "oh this is cool something important is happening and i'm witnessing it! maybe they'll be an explosion or something!" ya know, cause i was a stupid kid. now i'm an adult, and i when see things like this my heart skips a beat as i worry what shit is happening and whose hurt. because this is the real world and big bad things happening in the real world have consequences that could be felt by myself and others in a very real way. i don't get excited, i get concerned. ya know, like mature adults do.
everyone, deep in their hearts, is secretly wishing for the end of the world.
two reasons: 1) people who make their money off hating on conservatives don't really have a lot of ammo during a democratic presidency. 2) he's the only liberal comedian i have seen who coherently makes fun of trump for his policies and does so in both a funny and logical way. so many of these comedians are taking the lazy way and just saying "trump is dumb" for cheap laughs, but maher is actually saying "here is is policy, here's why it's wrong, here's a funny punchline relevant to what i just said."
and?! don't leave me hanging!! it ducks that even in the alternate reality there's still clickbait headlines.
i feel bad for all the mean things i said about 2016
it got annoying when it was breaking news: presidential debate in 72 hours. that's not what those words mean.
we're so used to politicians lying we weren't prepared for one to tell the truth.
drain the swamp? build the wall? prosecute hillary? maga?
til the text at the bottom of the screen during the news is called a "chyron."
and of course, i heard that all in john oliver's accent, very good :)
no kidding. i went out for supper, and when i came home, there was a terror attack, and a neo-nazi using it to further his case for white supremacy. then i went to bed, and when i woke up, it turns out the attacker was white, and the neo-nazi was **still** using it as an example for why islam is evil. to to it all off, this neo-nazi is somewhat mainstream and fucking verified on twitter. i can't believe i'm going to say this, but fuck, i miss 2016.
luckily we have each other on reddit to survive the next 8 years. i've been so anxious i'm actually gonna apply for disability soon since i can't even go to work. this is just all really terrible. for the first time in my life i'm afraid of being a muslim. afraid they'll take me from my home.
or the whole lobbying thing. just gonna make it so we(the people) don't see who's buying votes
the thing with 9 trillion bucks that your kids have to pay later, is that it doesn't feel bad at the time.
excuse me for digressing a bit, but i believe i have a duty to say this. if you have a kroger (or kroger owned company) near you, buy their movie theatre butter popcorn. it's literally the cheapest bagged popcorn on the shelf, but it is by far the most delicious. perfect for watching the news!!
and that's why i don't want kids, best outcome we achieve meta-stability and the world doesn't further devolve into civilizational collapse in my lifetime, worst case it does and i only have to worry about riding it out comfortably until offing myself becomes an alluring perspective. i'm not saying it's for everybody but it definitely gives me some peace of mind.
i'm a little over a year clean from being a heroin addict most of my adult life. i don't want the world to end, it just started getting good for me! sometimes i think, "wtf, man? i got clean for this shit?" still worth it, though.
don't. 2016 was still a dirty whore. just because 2017 is turning into a steaming pile so quick doesn't excuse 2016 for being a dirty dirty garage pile.
i notice john oliver's got one of those accents you can really hear anything in and it'll sound pretty listenable.
i'll just go hang myself. i have failed her majesty.
i'm a formerly undocumented iranian immigrant who came to america via mexico, eventually got a green card, and now citizenship... so it's been a rough week.
w needs to make a statement. i know he's been keeping out, but it could actually make a pretty big impact if he publicly dissented.
oh man, if they're not already mad that you're muslim, a muslim on disability might make the apoplectic. you stay safe, bro.
oh christ, i haven't even seen this yet. i don't even know if i want to right now without booze on hand.
the truth is, pence, priebus, and bannon are already exerting great influence and are the real scary characters. even without one of them being president, it is all of them who are fucking us.
there always seems to be a greater evil. who's worse than bannon? who wins the "better ___ than ___"
do you want to die knowing all of humanity's hopes are lost? most died knowing things were carrying on, their kids had a chance. how do you fancy dieing knowing all our thousands of years development led to this? some brain dead cunt-puppet was given enough power to destroy us all and all our slow rise to civilisation.
lower-third is the "key" itself that you see naming people locations, etc. it's called that because it's in the bottom or lower section in the 'rule of thirds'.. chyron is the system/company that develops tv graphic programs.. but it's becoming sort of like google and some places just call lower-thirds chyron even tho they don't use the program. fun fact!
and now i am reading all the comments in john oliver's. thanks for that lol ugh i want john oliver to come back to make me feel better about all this.
significantly more upvotes for the suggesting you were going to hang yourself. that's nice isn't it?
damn. you've lived quite a life. don't let anyone tell you you're not an american.
you have to know you're in a shit show when the koch brothers are calling trump dangerous, and a loose cannon. how loose does your cannon have to be to get a jimmy russle out of the koch boys?
you need sitting republicans to publicly dissent and then do something about it. they have the power: impeach, umpeach, fuck and unfuck. they can stop this lunatic if they want to. no need for bush jr.
i would like to see that too, but the evidence presenting itself seems to point to trumpers just dismissing bush as "the establishment" gop. maybe i'm wrong: trump has already become the first president to open his presidency with a below-50% approval rating since approval ratings of presidencies were measured (starting with truman i think). but trump is still under the delusion of a popular mandate despite losing the popular vote. something has to give.
the person you're replying to pretends to be people he's not. check his history. at different points he claims to be both a man and a woman, and he has some really weird made up stories in there. most are meant to make people dislike muslims.
i hate to break it to you, but short of a medical miracle, i doubt you, me, or anyone else here will make it to 2117.
exactly! trump is just mouthing off on twitter and signing shit that is put in front of him. even if he goes for whatever reason, the cabal of assholes that have been put in place will remain, and continue to exert yuge influence.
trump, bannon, pence. marry one, fuck one, kill one, go.
when you live on the internet everything is a safe click.
in the uk we call vacuums hoovers, even though hoover is a brand.
i spend half of my booze money on ammo, armor, and training. eh, it's not white people, it's just bigots and fascists. they're always the problem.
lol. you just triggered the nuts off two thirds of reddit: "how dare you speak for me?! can't you see that i'm a special snowflake?! i'm a special snowflake!" bravo!
2016 : worst year ever 2017 : worst year ever 2 : judgement day
then we get mike pence. the more you pick on that presidential scab, the pus gets worse that comes out of it.
he really can do no wrong in the eyes of the members of the cult of personality he's created. if a democrat criticizes him, they're a no-nothing liberal, snowflake demoncrat. if a republican criticizes him, they're a "rino" or part of the establishment.
"i prefer my popcorn free range." ~ abraham lincorn.
tbh, everything you eat kills you now. that's why i moved off the grid and grow naturally sourced poop potatoes
he is just a tool for other elements around him, but i honestly do think that if trump goes, bannon goes. pence has his agenda, but it doesn't involve shock-and-awe style politicking. his game is more of a long-game.
actually, on second thought, not too hard. marry trump for the money, fuck pence because he'd die if he ever was in the same room as a naked man (let alone fucking one), and kill bannon because he's a douchebag piece of shit
hey, you seem like a nice person. i hope that you stay safe and everything is peaceful in your area. i am always glad to meet immigrants! it is so important for loving people to band together in tough times. :)
bigots, fascists, extremists, all a problem for every religion and race. if everyone focused their anger at the criminals using religion as a way to further their cause instead of at eachother, maybe we could actually use a republican us president's policies to our advantage and figure out a way to work together to stop these people.
maybe that's the probalem nowadays? not enough chill?
/r/getmotivated would say "only one? wow. i just did 10. wanna try to beat me?"
i have always been a staunch liberal since high school (maaany moons ago) and i would be ok with pence. i feel trump is a loose cannon and he is so impulsive it will be hard to guess what he will do next. however; pence, i feel, would be more methodical and it would be easier to guess what he will do next (chuch+state, anti-gay marriage, etc.) when comparing the two it is easy to choose who i would rather have leading the country and being the face of our country. a crazy, loud lunatic or a crazy, quiet lunatic. easy choice for me really.
definitely say dude and bro to my girlfriend, it's funny
you water them with hydrazine though, right? checkmate martian hippies.
his game may not be all that long... - 1) get on the ticket *(check)* - 2) win the election *(check)* - 3) wait for trump to get impeached *(pending)*
"marry trump for the money" isn't really working out for melania. her face is in a constant state of "get me out of here."
if 100 people can each stick one toy car in their shitter, what's keeping you from putting 100 toy cars in yours?
i like my chemicals to retain their nutritional value with least amount of processing. organic for me please.
i just read the book "shockaholic" where she made some kind of "joke" about her death... "but hey, at least we have the x-box 360 kinect michael jackson experience to remember him by. and his music. its not much compared to still having michael. **what you'll have of me after i journey to that great death star in the sky is an extremely accomplished daughter, a few books, and a picture of a stern-looking girl wearing some kind of metal bikini lounging on a giant drooling squid, behind a newscaster informing you of the passing of princess leia after a long battle with her head.**"
this was my favorite quote from the link: "you know what's funny about death? i mean other than absolutely nothing at all? you'd think we could remember finding out we weren't immortal. sometimes i see children sobbing airports and i think, "aww. they've just been told. carrie fisher, wishful drinking"
carrie fisher drowned in moonlight, strangled by her own bra
she also said that donald trump will not be president in her lifetime. i guess she was right
the poor first responders who had to find her like that...
are we all going to be watching star wars tonight?
well lads, are we going to fulfill a dead woman's wish or what?
it's because george lucas told her she can't wear a bra under her dress because she would expand in space due to weightlessness and her bra would kill her.
mara wilson reported this on facebook. i had no idea this was carrie fisher's actual dying wish.
for someone who doesn't speak english as first language, what does she meant by "drowned in moonlight "?
go away, 2016. go be 2016 someplace else. i *really* thought she'd pull through. also holy crap she was only 60 -- i'm only two decades younger. i thought she was much older.
sounds like george lucas didn't know much about space physics or female anatomy ...
has george lucas even seen a bra? pretty sure you can't be strangled by it like that.
and kids on the floats will be throwing zolofts and paxils into the crowd instead of candy. it'll be great!
i have bipolar depression, and i never knew how outspoken she was about mental health until now. what a beautiful soul.
currently manic. spent 300$ on an iphone game today. about to go to group therapy and try to explain my purchases lol
if there is anything to gain from her passing, i hope it's a renewed public discussion on mental illness and disorder. as someone who sees a psychiatrist for possible bipolar disorder and struggles with manic episodes, i hope people start talking again about proper mental health awareness.
well, that's just being stubborn. i'm not surprised.
"oh god, it's a long line bra. get the jaws of life!"
i want to watch rouge one but no one wants to watch it with me
meanwhile every ship in that universe clearly has artificial gravity and pressurized interiors. at no point are they weightless.
there may have been a little snark involved when she wrote that, but i'm guessing she'd be pleased nonetheless if that was how it was reported.
copiously covered by or surrounded in. like you would drown a pancake in maple syrup. since in the imagery she's invoking, she's in space, drowned in moonlight gives a beautiful, otherworldly image of floating serenely in space bathed in moonlight that contrasts with the mundane absurdity of being strangled by one's own bra.
the people we grew up loving are all starting to die. 2017 will bring more of the same. :(
sounds more like he just wanted to watch a braless carrie fisher run/jiggle all over the set of new hope.
i'm not super *super* into star wars, but i've seen all the movies and it appears every ship has artificial gravity, so fluid redistribution due to weightlessness would not be an issue. he just wanted to see boobs. and honestly, if carrie fisher was cool with it, my penis agrees.
i'm wondering if she typed it somewhere or whoever did type it doesn't have a basic understanding of the english language.
as conceived by the director that had queen amadala fall in love with a 10 year old boy instead of ewan mcgregor.
i was thinking the same. or did he mean the bra becomes so thight it literally crushed your lungs? anyway it does not make any sense.
interesting tidbit: ssris can be dangerous for people with type 1 bipolar disorder because they can trigger manic episodes.
sad to here about the spending but good on you going to group therapy! my dad used to spend it on records and then cds (the eighties). he would always say "at least i dont spend it on buying cars". so look at the bright side :)
go check out /r/bipolarreddit it's a great community.
is it weird that i can't stop thinking "her poor dog!" they seemed inseparable.
in all seriousness, you can totally see a movie by yourself. i think sometimes there's a stigma attached to doing something like that alone, but fuck it. you can't talk to anyone during the film anyway, so why does going to the movie have to be for two or more? :)
unfortunately i think 2016 was only priming us for the coming decade.
there will be more deaths in 2017, but i don't think it will be quite as many as this year, they'd space it out a bit give a 3 month gap between heroes dying. this year, christ, its like a damn burst.
in his defense few things gets people into movie theaters like a nice pair of boobs. he could have just been pervy, or he could have been trying to stack the deck for his movies.
yeah, but it was a different time back then. a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
we already know he is perverted enough to throw incest around.
but she was also known as one of the best script doctors and wrote several books. she was just eccentric on twitter.
to be fair it was the 10 year old boy that fell in love with the hot older chick. she didn't fall in love till he went all awkward clingy while they were hiding out on her planet
bp2 as well, which i learned from personal experience. the biggest danger per my pdoc is taking them without a mood stabilizer.
they are also used to treat it, and must be, as manic related psychosis episodes are extremely dangerous. source: lost my wife to late onset of bipolar i. she chose several times to stop the ssri treatments and, immediately following each cessation, she'd go into a manic state with serious psychoses (mark zuckerburg being god and speaking through her as the world's savior) in which she put our daughter at risk. so, psa: if you're prescribed ssris or anti-psychotics in response to a serious mental disorder diagnosis, please take the pills and don't subscribe to the notion that they make it worse.
and seroquel is bad for people with type 2 because its helps with the manic but can cause depression and suicidal thoughts. being bipolar sucks and carrie was one of my idols, it hurts to see her go so young. :(
i love how she celebrates it with this quote instead of seeing the negative side. bipolar people do some stuff "normal" people would never dare to do, and because of it, (in some cases) outperform others. of course there's also a lot of suffering. but damn, my dad was pretty awesome :)
i can vouch. i strangled her with her bra in the moonlight
or just tack it on near the death part as a fact and they'll probably let you keep it.
whoever manages her dog gary's twitter posted something like "mommy's gone, i'll miss her". when i saw that i just bawled like a baby; does the dog understand why she's not coming back? is it sadder if he understands or if he doesn't? i'll miss carrie, she was amazing.
to everyone whose relative died and had a dog -- take the dog to the funeral, or the dog will be waiting for his owner for the rest of its life.
you'd have better luck finding some way to make it funny to /b/ there's nothing they won't do for a good laugh
unless death tries coming for keith richards - keith will take him out.
1/10/2016, a date which will live in infamy. i wasn't ready to let bowie go then and i'm not now. i can't believe he's gone. :( we ended 2015 with lemmy's passing, and started 2016 with bowie's passing.
my guess, apart from what was undoubtedly a bit of that (boobs are never bad), is that george didn't want to have to worry about his costumes showing brief / bra lines, as it might remind folks that these are just actors and not actually space men.
i heard he strangled carrie fisher with his own bra in the moonlight.
seroquel sucks because of the weight gain and connections to insulin resistance, too. according to my psychopharm class, however, the seroquel-lithium combo has a high efficacy rate.
bipolar maniac here.. i find it so strange to see people talking about it without apologizing for it right off hand. happy to know i'm not alone, even if i'm 22, broke both my feet after a strange career as a bodyguard. i think i should go into entertainment, it seems like my kind of people do better there anyways.
he was at the hospital before she died, so i hope he got to see her one last time. dogs don't understand death unless they actually see/smell it themselves. bringing a dog to its dead owner sounds super dark, but it's the only way to show the dog what happened.
my wife moved out of her parents place about 3 years ago, leaving her three boston terriers behind. the poor little things were heartbroken when mama wasn't there anymore. patches kept going to her bed room door and just staring at it and whimpering. they jumped all over her immediately when she came back for a visit. dogs are smart, and i'm pretty sure gary can realize what's going on.
i'm pretty sure it was carrie's daughter (billie lourd) managing the twitter account post-heart attack and she's also taking care of gary now (news reports said that she was the one who brought gary by the hospital though gary was on the plane with carrie when she had the heart attack).
isn't that where the infamous hacker 4chan resides?
i might have to unsub from /r/empiredidnothingwrong
bra tech is pretty boring, actually. sure there's measuring and stress testing, but it's a whole lot of staring at cad. the field you *want* is breast physics.
that does explain the natalie portman nippage in attack of the clones.
then explain the visible panty lines on all those tie fighters?
i don't speak spanish but i'm pretty sure i understood anyways.
"i actually had the story for 9 movies before i shot a new hope" lies.
also it's not it's like luke and leia really had any romantic feelings towards each other, even then their relationship was very sibling-ish and the kiss was just to fuck with han, luke clearly knew it and was just playing along
just curious.. who do you think "no, there is another..." was referring to?
oh man....i don't know about you guys but i literally can't read that emoji lettering stuff, is it supposed to be legible?
you should take a look at cher's twitter while you're at it.
i couldn't move and was not very coherent. i guess it was easiest to just snip the front.
so what's the story about your feet? yes don't ever apologize for having a mental illness. nobody apologizes for having diabetes as far as i know!
he only claims to have been party to the strangling with his nefarious sidekick the brassiere, if i read that correctly.
that's not how bipolar disorder works though. that joke fits more into borderline personality disorder.
when i went away for college my parents said my dog checked my bedroom every morning to see if i was there. she was always so happy when i came back to visit.
well there might not be underwear in space but i would assume there are still nipples.
does anyone really? isn't that a myth like santa claus, fairies and the country of finland?
to be fair, when my wife asks me to unhook her bra, i would much rather cut it than try to find out how to unhook it.
i spent a lot of time training, ended up collapsing halfway through a sparring match. found out from my doc that i have a genetic weakness in my ankles that caused them to collapse from all the strain. ended up breaking a few bones and tearing a few tendons and other soft tissue. now i need surgery and recovery and physical therapy. lost most of my progress physically too, which sucks big time. i'm a big, big guy. and when the muscle went it traded places with soft flabbyness. haha. i gotta find some wheelchair exercises. but yeah, i have to be constantly doing things and it was amazing to find out that i wasn't broken just designed differently. when i found that out it changed a lot of things for me, and slowly i see more and more people with the issue coming out proudly. which is amazing for me, personally.
that sounds so tragic that i'm almost mad at the dog for being so innocent. i wonder how it feels when it doesn't kow what's going on but cares about you enough to miss you.
im a chick and it baffles me that they are commonly cheaper else where. how much cheaper???
don't forget the mythical place called belgium, in the sea of luxembourg.
thing is he didn't know he was his sister. growing up together is the thing that takes away the sexual attraction.
she's taking us all with her via emoji cancer and bra-strangling.
-pointy finger behind the hook, thumb and middle finger on each side. -use pointy finger to hold hook area a little bit out. -grab the hook area with your thumb and middle finger, you should now have about an inch of bra between those two fingers. -make a slide motion kinda like you are snapping your fingers (keep in mind which way the hooks are, snap opposite way. most bras are left shoulder to right, this means thumb goes out middle finger goes in). -bra is now unhooked with one hand, you look like a seduction god.
australian, male, no idea about bras. but, out of interest, what sort of price are we talking? i will ask the girlfriend later haha. "why were you talking about bras?" "jiggly tits and the empire" it'll be fine.
more likely he outlined a very basic plot following the hero's journey.
-place piece of bra between to blades of an open pair of scissors. -squeeze handles of scissors, freeing bossoms from their prison. --- i think my method is easier.
now this is a story all about how, my face looks fat from upside down, i like to take a minute just sit right there, i look like uncle phill when i fly through the air.
remake the series where a trust fund baby goes to west philadelphia to evade insider trading accusations and to live with his uncle will. the boy introduces everyone to the latest electronic gadgets, gives stock market tips, and shows them how to schmooze your way into higher society. he has a streetwise cousin named c-note who always turns his legitimate financial ventures into illegal schemes. with his wall street charm and business acumen, he shows the family that love doesn't conquer all, but money buys everything.
fun trivia for the day= uncle phil played shredder in the old tmnt cartoon.
"i ain't no bungee expert or nothin, but i don't think he's suppose to be slamming on the ground like that " you'll get this is if you've seen fresh prince
time for a fresh prince reboot with uncle will... carlton and his wife have been kidnapped while on business in south america. their spoiled and troublesome teen is sent to live with her middle class uncle will in south philly. no more benz's and gucci purses for her.... coming soon to netflix (naturally)
he's in better shape though get rid of the grey hair and you'd never be able to tell
"what if will was playing uncle phil in real life?" - jayden smith
i never realized how much uncle phil looks like he could really be will's uncle. there's actually kind of a strong resemblance.
in west zimbabwe, bored and crazed on victoria falls bridge i spent one of my days chillin' out maxin', and drinkin' like a fool i thought maybe bungee jumpin' might be kinda cool
i think this would actually work, you would just need to change it up a bit. trust-fund baby shouldn't be evading anything, he should be sent there by his parent, carlton, who's wife left him or passed away. he is sent there because he is treating everything like it's nothing more than his right. while will is living in west philly, he has made something of himself but is still the free spirit that he was when he first went to bel air, and sees his nephew more uptight than carlton when he moved out there, but also shallow and believing that he deserves anything and everything, just because he considers himself above everyone else. will tries to introduce him to the real world, and show him that not everyone is handed everything and that they have to work hard and earn it. holy fuck, i need this show now! someone get a hold of will smith!
the only problem is that if uncle will is played by will smith, then jaden gets to be the boy
and played war machine in the first season of the iron man cartoon
except for your "90s kids will get this" addition, it was a great comment.
i **knew** it was this scene. i **knew** what it was going into it. but **damn** these onions are always present.
looks like the bungey jump over the zambezi river in between zambia and zimbabwe.
it's "how come he don't want me man?" the shaky-voiced "man" really drives it home
"he's uncle will to the world, i call him father phil." - jayden smith
will's mom and vivian were sisters on the show; will's character was not a blood relative of uncle phil.
but, he had no relation to will aside from marriage. aunt viv was will's mom's sister, uncle phil married into the family.
then a couple of guys, relatively good, tried to sell me stuff carved out of wood. i looked at my handler and he got scared, he said, "mr. smith, please get back in the van so that we can head to the airport and get back to south africa."
netflix please write will a check and fire up the cameras.
the main character would end up being jaden smith being sent to live with will's mom in philly. not sure how i'd feel about that
james avery (uncle phil) was an awesome person. i worked at a grocery store in la that he would frequently come in to. i would offer to help him take his groceries out to the suv but he would usually want to do it himself. as he started to have health problems he reluctantly started to accept help - and would always tip generously after we got him loaded up. we would decline the tips but he would insist. i miss him and will never forget the first time i met him in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
i didn't even know there *was* an iron man cartoon. now i know what my childhood was missing...
the echo in the house when he yells "the hell with him" is absolutely bone chilling.
that show as so goddamn funny, but it had moments where it made you goddamn cry. this was definitely one of them
as someone who never had a father growing up this really hits home.
uncle phil's mannerisms are so funny. i love watching him get angrier and angrier.
i know that(though i wasn't really thinking of it at the time). but either way they look like they could really be related imo.
why do you think they make them wear numbers in the nba? /s
we had a good thing going. you just had to go and fuck it up huh??
if you tell will smith all the profits go to the church of scientology he will probably be unable to reject the deal out of fear of ritualized murder of his whole family by the church! aren't cults fun!
i'd pray not, give him a guest appearance or something, but not a main role. he doesn't have enough talent (or rather any talent) to pull off being a spoiled brat. yes, i know he is one, but not in the way you would expect one to be portrayed in this instance.
in bel air, los angeles born and raised, in the real estate market's where i made my pay.
every. god. damn. time. i need to start checking usernames.
oh my god there's a .gif that follows it now! bravo, u/shittymorph. bravo.
school, man. school. wwiii could happen today and i probably wouldn't know until like 2-3 weeks later.
definitely. remember that episode where will got drunk and got visited by a kid that was killed by a drunk driver? the show is a comedy, but when it got serious, it got *serious*.
raised by a single father and a mother who abandoned at 10, so i have so many memories of her and how much i loved her and she just left and dropped contact with me. to this day i wonder why and i cry nearly everyone i see this scene.
oh, man. so, i'm guessing you saw the story today about the little girl that drowned trying to save her puppy?
the way his eyes bulge out of his head, while that smile gets increasingly sinister.
if anyone questions this they should go to idaho as it's actually considered the center of the world according to the flat-earth principles. once you're there ask yourself one question, you ever see two black people in the same place at the same time? yeah i thought so
wait. seriously? they got will too? that's fucking news to me. 4 hours a day on reddit is letting me down.
lying to him probably wouldn't be effective. we need to infiltrate the church of scientology and ensure that the "church" legitimately does want to make this show happen.
chillin out maxin investin all cool and all sippin some pinot outside by the pool.
holy crap i was going to write this. that part is the only scene of a tv show that's ever made me tear up. a flash of will smith's future range and genius as an actor
shit. i upvoted before i finished reading. what a rookie.
i think i finished reading his first sentence and somehow knew, i could just feel like it was a trap. it took some time but i'm catching on. i'm having fun trying to anticipate him by his writing style.
holy fuck i didnt know this was that real until now
and you always knew it was coming because jazz would be wearing that shirt!
uncle phil jason seaver dan conner the tv dad trifecta
air1: ground control, this is air1, got a report on that bogey. gc: go ahead air1. air1: looks like a zinger went supersonic. requesting permission to disengage. gc: permission granted air1, get the fuck out of there.
wait, bots can link gifs? what a time to be alive.
when a couple of suits who were up to no good, filed fraud cases against my investment group
they keep getting better and better i'll give him that
really? i guess for us older folks this was a huge deal at the time. wrestling was super popular at the time. it made a lot of us think owen hart's fall wasn't real for a bit.
i thought this was going to be that damn sr-71 story
he really has a talent for coming up with creative entrances for his joke.
except, both falls were real. when the announcer screams "oh god they killed him!" that was him breaking kayfabe. mankind hit hard, even undertaker thought he did major damage to him.
the fresh prince's cousin hillary had a long term boyfriend named trevor. in an episode he proposed to her on live tv while bungee jumping. the cord snapped, he died. poor trevor...
he gets you invested in the first sentence. of course i want to hear a cool story about my favorite tv dad.
this was the thumbtack match too right? undertaker poured them out in the middle of the ring, and then choke slammed him on that too.
the metal chair fell onto his face causing him to puncture his bottom lip completely through.
that thousand yard stare...this pup has seen some shit.
did you send a photo to the company that makes the cozy? you dog could be a model, instead of a can.
i know they get a bad rep but chihuahuas are freaking awesome. imagine the sight of a 6'2 guy walking 2 tiny chihuahuas....even gangbangers stop and smile at them.
ha, great pic. that fits almost perfectly for him. what breed is he?
who the hell puts the text bar right in the middle of the object of focus?
didn't know i wanted sicario remade with chihuahuas until right now.
off-chihuahua topic, how was sicario? i meant to see it in theaters, but missed it, and i never heard anything bad or good about it.
oh man i loved that movie. i should rewatch it sometimes.
i remember that morning like it was yesterday. we had set up camp near the sofa in what we thought was a secure location. without warning, it was upon us...i can still hear the sound it made. that devilish, whirling cry that reverberated through the still morning air and pierced down to my very soul. i remember barking and barking...and then just like that it was over, the noise ceased and deafening silence filled the room once more. the last thing i saw was its cord winding around its shiny plastic body as it retreated back into the closet from whence it came. now, i only see it when i close my eyes.
i was opening the envelope it showed up in and my dog was watching me thinking it was food...i looked at the cozy...looked at my dog...then magic happened
thank you, i was looking for someone to say it right.
sounds like you don't have a cat armor problem...you've got a nana problem *you know what ta do*
he's a tri color (dark brown, tan and white) chihuahua named zombie
dark, violent version of those beverly hills chihuahua movies.
i'm sure your chihuahua speaks with a mexican accent just like mine did.
i wish i could see it with you. i mean overall, the impact isn't so strong--the plot isn't all that sophisticated or anything (though it's entirely fine and handled well, the production values are great, it always feels big-screen/big-budget), the characters are good but it's not like you get deeply invested in them. but it more than makes up for the lack of overall impact, by pacing the action scenes with a patient extraordinary professionalism that puts it above any similar movie in the past few years. you won't come away thinking "what an incredible story" but you may well come away thinking "what an incredible handful of action scenes" and also wanting to see more of one character, either in prequel or sequel form. overall i'd give it 4/5 stars, or 3.5/4. because i'd like a more engaging storyline, but everything else is goddamn perfect.
you should. i loved it even more the second time around, and third and the fourth...
i want answers because that is the first thing that i noticed is that i could see every fur follicle...
how bad does he dislike it? i've known some chihuahuas to tolerate clothing because they are usually cold.
how big/heavy is he? my dog is half chihuahua and i so badly want to get one of these for her, if it would fit.
wheeeelp......just pissed my pants...don't even care...best day ever
i had negative expectations for it, thinking it was just a cash-in on the popularity of narcos and some other similar stuff at the time. so i delayed seeing it until some months after it was released. nope, it fucking rocked. i can't remember any time i've felt as much tension as the border crossing traffic jam, except maybe the heat bank shootout when i first saw it in the theater. (you think that shit is loud on your home speakers...)
hi, i am an executive producer for the expendables 4 and would like to offer the dog 4 treats to star in it.
you eat pieces of shit for breakfast? (great movie)
only $22 for a small ballistic dog vest. now it sounds like a deal.
i've only read four of your comments and they've consisted of almost dying while eating goldfish, losing it at a hardware store, and pissing your pants. you seem like an awesome person!
the sunset in the desert silhouetted march, shivers.
they were all killed by a direct hit from a red rocket.
the cinematography *made* that movie for sure. the story was pretty straightforward and the acting was pretty good but it was just shot so beautifully.
chocolate, yellow and black labs are the same breed and all retarded
red rocket always reminds me of my mum, and the time she jerked off my dog accidentally.
"oh abe, why didn't you tell them you were getting *high* off your mother's love, like we practised?"
adorable, loyal, and highly perceptive to training. but most definitely retarded.
holy shit..eating goldfish crackers..almost died...
jfk: are, uh, you drunk enough to sleep with me? [joan of arc kicks jfk in the face] jfk: answer the question!
dude, stop doing things while reading these comments, it's just not safe.
i envy the constant state of hilarity you exist in. you must be a perpetually smiling person.
if this was the first video seen by an alien civilization they'd have a really hard time making sense of our technology.
shutter speed? i didn't know video worked like that. isn't it just the frame rate?
quick, somebody post this to a conspiracy theory website and title it something like "secret government anti-gravity experiments accidentally revealed!" some rube(s) will buy it.
what kind of camera was this taken with? it seems like it would be crazy hard to sync that up after but trivial to photoshop.
is nobody else bothered by the use of ` rather than ' in that possessive?
if it's a video camera... wouldn't the frame rate be synced... not the shutter speed?
can someone with professional knowledge on this topic confirm this is what is actually happening? thanks!
"are those decorative rotors? what a weird species."
way easier to phrase than my similar thought, "what if this was the only video left when all technology is destroyed, and the next "humans" are dumb-founded for centuries."
put it on the flat earth society and watch them lose their fucking minds.
it just has to sync up with the rotation. not necessarily that each photo is taken with 1 full rotation but it can be a number of rotations. i highly doubt the camera is capturing that quickly, but if you can sync it up close enough with a multiple of the period it takes for a full rotation you can get this effect. any photographers want to chime in with the technical explanation?
now *you* know that, and *i* know that. and lots of others commenting here do too. but apparently the op doesn't !
they are clearly backup-rotors in case the anti-gravity drive fails while exiting the atmosphere. the blades can be run by batteries charged through solar power, neatly sidestepping the fuel requirements of traditional rockets while giving more control than a parachute. these humans must be a clever race indeed!
if they can play this video they would likely be familiar with the concept of frames
*ohhh you almost had it*, you gotta be quicker than that!
it's nearly 30 years since i went to hong kong, but seeing the star ferry i was fairly sure where this was - even if i didn't recognise *anything* else!
victoria harbour to be exact, i think that's the helipad near the macau ferry terminal. i could be wrong though.
if shutterspeed == rotorspeed: gravity = false
should be like if(shutterspeed == rotorspeed){gravity=false;}
i got bored with my previous hobbies, my current one is finding new content and raising my gilding trophy as it's fun and brightens other people's day.
the shutter speed is not the frame rate, but i'm sure you know that! you'd need to match the frame rate and have a very high shutter speed so you don't get any motion blur on the rotors. matching the rpm of the rotors with the frame rate still wouldn't give this effect without very fast shutter.
what if alien civilizations watched videos based on moving pixels than the change of pixel colors.
no one. his name was george oscar bluth jr. he just went by g.o.b. because he's a moron.
i actually love pun threads, it's fun seeing them really take off.
because the ferries themselves haven't changed in 30 years lol i was last in hk in 2013 and stayed at a family's spare flat in tseung kwan o. the last time i was there in 1986 (i was a kid), most of tko was still in the water!
yep, she was the musical guest on that episode, jt was hosting. was a damn good one, actually.
camel case variables in python? blasphemous! if shutter_speed == rotor_speed: gravity = false
personally i'm a fan of: gravity=(shutterspeed==rotorspeed)?false:gravity;
isn't the original source from a 4chan green text?
guys please we all know javascript is better; if (shutterspeed == rotorspeed) { gravity = false; } else { gravity = true; } *puts on helmet and braces for down votes*
depends on what language, but you're still needing == in your if statement.
wouldn't it be: gravity = (shutterspeed == rotorspeed) ? false : true; also i cleaned up your spacing. we're programmers not animals here :p
i know i'll get downvoted for saying this, but a giant amount of /u/gallowboob's posts are not reposts (or even x-posts). he really knows how to find content that hasn't been on reddit before. i've seen him repost on accident and delete his post when he sees the original if it's on the same subreddit. i sincerely think he has no intentions of reposting. and always remember that x-posting is something the reddit staff and reddiquete encourages.
the one-liner version: gravity = (shutterspeed !== rotorspeed);
because snake_case is the standard convention in python.
if(shutter.speed == rotor.speed) {gravity.ison = false};
i defy your expectations and respect your opinion. have an upvote.
can confirm. i'd always felt lady gaga doing jazz (sort of) would be where i'd really get to appreciate her talent without the pop culture aspects i find to be meh
or if you want to go full blown shit code mode, gravity = shutterspeed - rotorspeed if shutterspeed = rotorspeed gravity will equal 0 which is a false-y value, otherwise it will be truth-y (so if gravity { //stuff } will work)
or just go full gravity=!(shutterspeed==rotorspeed); while we're at it
camelcasemasterrace...? i_prefer_snake_case_myself.
terrible news. love watching him on the big screen. some of my favorite movies growing up had robin in the them
when i lived in sf as a kid i would go to robin williams house on halloween to trick or treat and he would give out toothbrushes as a gag. i played in the same soccer league as his son also and ran into him a couple times in the bay area. he was such a nice guy. lost a good one
literally the only post that has ever made my heart skip. this man will be missed dearly. i tried to keep my composure, but i couldn't. he reminded me of my father, caring, silly, and warm. i can't believe he is gone.
this kind of really sucks. he's in my all time favorite movie: good will hunting he definitely had talent. will be missed.
holy crap i feel like this came out of nowhere....
depression is a disease. he wasn't being selfish or a bad person. he was just sick. god bless this man. he made so much of my childhood.
this is so sad i usually don't get bothered by celebrity deaths but this one just felt different i didn't feel like crying but i did feel sick to my stomach and just feeling like it can't possibly be true edit misspelled a word
could some genie break rule no. 2: bring people back from the dead.
o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done; the ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won; the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting, while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring: but o heart! heart! heart! o the bleeding drops of red, where on the deck my captain lies, fallen cold and dead
this one hurts. edit #1: rip robin, one of the funniest, most gentle, genuinely likeable people i've ever known. edit #2: lots of good resources in this thread for people dealing with depression. please look at them.
it is hard to remember that actors and singers and comedians and famous people are exactly that. people. they battle grief and depression and addiction and all of those things you and me have to deal with. the tragedy is not that we lost someone who was in good movies. the tragedy is that a human being has passed away. a talented human being with a family and friends and a career. we will miss you, robin. not your movies. you.
national suicide prevention hotline: 1-800-273-8255
holy shit was he sick at all? or was this sudden?
came here to say this. my dad bought me a copy of mrs doubtfire when he and my mom were going through an extremely messy divorce. there was some comfort in watching that movie, but to this day i can't watch it as it brings me back to how i felt all those years ago.
a lot of movies are going to be hard to watch now.
i can't believe it. i was reliving my childhood by watching hook again last night, this is such a blindside.
world's greatest dad is going to be tough to watch now.
once ran into him in san anselmo after school with my mom and he bough us milkshakes at bubba's and stayed to talk with us for almost a half hour. such a great person, really brightened my life
i'm just going to watch "what dreams may come" and pretend this is what's happening.
same here. my whole body dropped when i read the headline.
nice story, and good on you for giving him a moment of normalcy.
that scene at the end of good will hunting always gets me. i can't believe he's gone, really loved his acting and comedy. rip.
i can't even picture this man suffering from depression. he is probably the last person i would have ever expected to commit suicide. this is insane.
it hurts to think of such a hilarious guy being depressed enough to kill himself.
me too. he was a huge part of mine and many peoples childhoods. it's almost like losing a grandfather.
completely agree. he made me so happy when i was a kid ... :(
it always seems like the comedians are the depressed ones. he brought so much joy to the screen.
my heart sank when i first heard this. i've never felt so heartbroken over a celebrity passing.
this year has been tough. philip seymour hoffman passing away was a rough time too.
i feel like that's exactly the joke he'd want in this thread. (honestly.) well done.
laughter is sometimes the best way to deal with times like this. rip robin.
my google-fu isn't producing... can you explain the joke?
i urge you to share the imgur link and any other screenshots you find of the media behaving this way. they should not be rewarded for this behavior.
yea, i refreshed facebook and saw 10 posts in a row about it. i came to reddit hoping to find it was a hoax. now i'm reading all the linked stories and confirmations. this sucks.
oh i forgot, he named his daughter zelda. oh god i can't imagine what she must be going though.
it seems that the funniest people tend to be the most unhappy. comedy seems to be how they hide their depression.
often times the funniest ones are also the most depressed.
from watchmen: i heard a joke once: man goes to doctor. says he's depressed. says life is harsh and cruel. says he feels all alone in a threatening world. doctor says, "treatment is simple. the great clown pagliacci is in town tonight. go see him. that should pick you up." man bursts into tears. says, "but doctor... i am pagliacci." good joke. everybody laugh. roll on snare drum. curtains.
he gave all his happiness away to others and left none for himself.
which just shows what a fucking bastard depression is. you can know exactly what you need to do and you have beaten it before but when it takes over, you just don't give enough of a fuck to do it. time to watch the fisher king tonight.
this is the first time i'm actually speechless. i don't know what to say or even think. most celebrity deaths don't bother me, but this one hit hard.
i actually feel kinda sick. he's been one of my favorite actors for as long as i can remember. i don't think i've felt so completely taken aback by a star's death since john candy. this one really, really hurts.
this is what growing old feels like. your heroes die.
that meme is going to be tough to laugh at for a while
robin rolls a 3 at the end jumanji. games over. not sure if there is more too it than that.
somebody check on jim carrey please =( don't let nothing happen to him.
chris farley, mitch hedberg, artie lang, charley chaplin, jim carrey have all struggled with depression. suicide seems like a common thing among comedians. hell, take a guy like daniel tosh, his whole persona is being an overconfident douche. but in reality his whole persona is an act and he suffers from social anxiety, and ocd.
man i'll always remember him for his performance in good will hunting.
it was one of the most shining, wonderful amas i've ever gotten to do. it was in-person. and it was like the light of all the 90's kids childhoods were all gathered together in that room. robin was incredible, and warm, and kind, and funny. and i was sad when it was time to go.
i once heard conan o'brien say that the funnier a person was, the more they hated themselves. rip and thank you for all the happiness you gave.
rorschach always knows the right things to say at the right time.
i saw him at recovery meetings in june. he was approachable, willing to talk to people who were new to recovery, and he appeared to take his recovery seriously. he was dually diagnosed with mental-health problems and addiction.
seriously, depression is something **very** serious that often gets put as a joke. it eats you alive to have all these people. friends. parents. colleagues all so full of life, yet all you can muster up the courage to do is fake a smile. pretend to be happy and full of life, but inside there's something missin that even you can't see. sometimes i hate the thought of gettingout of bed, other times, i just don't want to leave me house. i wish i never had this depression. i've always been envious of others who were truly happy, and full of life..
the worlds funniest man kills himself. sometimes you're reminded just how shit the world can be.
i've been expecting that but they're all dying too fucking young, drug overdoses and suicides, i can't believe robin williams is dead it just hasn't sunk in, fuck
yeah, but robin williams. you just, you know, you go through life expecting some cheesy holiday comedy every year... i mean the man was only 63. god, i don't know why i'm so shaken by this. celebrities die all the time. this feels different.
well, that was auto erotic asphyxiation... so hopefully not.
90's, 80's, and 70's. i grew up with mork & mindy; robin williams was the *funniest* guy of that time (and others). when he took on good morning vietnam, everyone was wondering what the hell he was doing; after all, "the world according to garp" hadn't done all that well. (one of my favorites, though.) but he absolutely nailed it. it wasn't all drama, but he was better than anyone had expected. and then came "dead poets society." and then a very serious turn on "homicide." and then good will hunting came along, and he cemented himself as one of the most diverse and talented actors ever on film. comedy, improv, drama, light, heavy, weird, straight. yeah, he did some stinkers, but bad robin williams was still always better than most stuff. this is a very big loss loss. but the size of it shows just how big a gift he was to so many people.
it often seems i've skipped a rung some days, for what it's worth. i've missed a step - i've slipped and swung to some peculiar earth. *on days like these, those moments tossed* *emerge with careless haste -* *to leave me hopeless, hurt and lost,* *with bitter truths to taste.* i'm sure it seems absurd to hear i'd grieve to let him go - i'd close my eyes and shed a tear for guys i didn't know - *but all the same - i will a while.* *that man i never met -* *the man that made me laugh and smile -* *i never shall forget.*
that's a man who should have died in his late 80's or older surrounded by friends and loved ones. this stinks :(
i don't know why. i think it's because he was a good one. not just skilled at his craft, though he was; immensely so. but a good man. reminded you to be better, kept you laughing at the darkest of times. yet he knew seriousness, and quite obviously knew pain. he uplifted the world around him, which even some of the most famous of celebrities don't always do. cheesy though he was, he was a reminder of something better. and again, he was only 63. if he had lived his full life, if he had long since retired it wouldn't hit so hard. but he hadn't. as someone else said, he was kind of a hero. certainly inspired many others. and it's hard to lose a hero.
what dreams may come for me. he wasn't only a funny man, and that was one of his more beautiful films. definitely going to be hard to take though.
why "hopefully not"? i'd prefer to see this man die doing something that brought him pleasure than dying in total misery.
i wrote a poem too... i guess it's how i'm coping. i wanted to share it, i hope you don't mind. goodbye genie goodbye peter pan goodbye bicentennial man goodbye batty koda goodbye armand join the real teddy roosevelt in the great beyond goodbye professors brainard and keating and maguire goodbye mrs. euphegenia doubtfire goodbye alan parrish and patch adams too to mork from ork we say "nanu nanu." goodbye to the impressions done so brilliantly but not to the impression you left on me although you never knew many lives you did touch, we all say: goodbye mr. williams we'll miss you so much.
what's wrong with death sir? what are we so mortally afraid of? why can't we treat death with a certain amount of humanity and dignity, and decency, and god forbid, maybe even humor. death is not the enemy gentlemen. if we're going to fight a disease, let's fight one of the most terrible diseases of all, indifference. - robin williams (patch adams)
think i'm just gonna switch off this light and drink for a bit while i listen to the rain fall.
this is pretty cool, although i've worked with preschoolers for quite a long time and they are well aware of how they look different from each other. not in a racist kind of way but they do compare skin tones and eye colors and who is short and who is tall, etc. they are smarter than we give them credit for.
what are these scoundrels doing in class that requires such a maniacal scheme? their disguises are just the start of some epic tomfoolery
when i was in preschool, my mom asked me if i noticed anything ***different*** about my best friend. i said, "yes, she's very short." i'm white - olive skinned, she was korean. our hair, skin and eyes were the same color and we were both set apart from the blond and redheaded girls. to me the big difference was height.
yanno, apart from pigment they do actually look like brothers
i don't understand the point of this? is this suppose to mean something?
kids don't care about race. they just want to have friends and have fun. only ignorant and irrational adults hate people because of the color of their skin or the birth place of their ancestors.
psychologist here! alright so in my field there used to be research going around that until puperty kids are just not very aware of their own appearance and that includes skin color. so the kid might just not be actively aware that he is white. if you'd ask him he could tell you of course, but it doesn't cross his mind spontaneously that his skin color is different. sadly there has been no further research on this topic since research on race perception is frowned upon nowadays and the most recent paper i could find on that topic is from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
this picture disgusts me. i can't believe they're allowed in the same school. who in their right mind would even be seen next to one of them? of course, i'm talking about steleers fans.
yeah seriously ones black and the others white - those shirts couldn't look any more different.
acknowledging people's different colors, shapes, and sizes isn't a bad thing. we're all wonderfully and terrifically different from each other. that can be something to celebrate! the problem is when we begin to harbor prejudices about certain differences.
for sure. these kids definitely realize that they're different colors and are far from identical. kids are extremely observant and aren't stupid.
i remember watching a documentary about girls picking out dolls and they did an experiment with white and black dolls. i don't remember the outcome for sure but i know it tipped in the white direction, even though i think they did a 50/50 selection of kids. i watch a lot of really crazy shit though, it could have been some white power propaganda film i'm thinking of. not that i support those ideas at all. i just watch a really wide variety of documentaries lol.
my parents were trying to figure out which kid my brother was talking about in his kindergarden class. when they finally narrowed it down to the only black kid in class, they asked him, "is she black?" my brother said, "no, she's kinda brown."
it's weird to me that people share stories like this and yet my toddler in a grocery store pointed at a black guy and kept saying 'daddy - daddy that guy is black - black guy look he's black - black guy!". thankfully he realized it's just a little toddler who doesn't know shit and he laughed his ass off.
i had this happen in university. my friend is a cbc (canadian-born chinese), so my brain filed him away under "canadian". when someone inevitably grouped him together with our other east asian friends i was like "but he's not asian." that was when i learned that my brain files away people by where they were born rather than skin tone.
seriously. kid on the left has slightly bigger ears but other features are very close.
oh they care about race. put them in a 40 yard dash and they will try like heck to win!
honestly, i don't think kids think about any of that unless it's planted in their mind by an adult. they don't care that the kid is black, asian, or anything else. they just know that they met this kid in school and they are friends. it's the most innocent they will ever be, and have no reason to judge anyone who looks different, because to them, everyone looks different. this kid has red hair, this one is tall, this one is short... and it doesn't matter to them.
black nerds get along with white nerds white thugs get along with black thugs. rich blacks get along with rich whites. not always of course but in general the problem is between mismatched culture/class. culture and class are the big divider. race is a distant third.
ehh that sounds good and all, but i specifically remember saying i wouldn't be friends with an iranian kid when i was like 6 because "he was black" even though i never heard anything like that from my parents. i went on to be really close friends with that kid, but i remember being pretty ignorant when i was 6 that i grew out of by 8
reminds me of an incident when i was little. starting when i was a baby, everyday my mother babysat a little girl the same age as me. i am white and very fair, the other little girl was black. well, we spent a lot of time together as little kids, and my mother even used to make us matching outfits. i thought we were sisters. i vividly remember looking in the mirror one day at around age three or four, and being shocked that i wasn't black like my "sister".
i wish i could see psych again for the first time.
one of the shirts is black and gold, and the other is blue and white. i'll let you decide which is which
god bless the kid in the button down for charity friending the other boy.
"just cover yourself in mud, and she won't be able to see you. teachers see in infrared."
now i just imagine we never actually see her, but whenever she talks it's raptor sounds.
i feel silly now, but one time circa age 5 had chapped lips that sort of turned dark, and i spent a week thinking i was simply turning black.
i remember being *really* confused one summer, because my very tanned "white" skin was darker than my half-black friend's skin, even though everyone called him "black". it was as though, briefly in my life, up was down and black was white!
i was the only kid in my preschool/kindergarten who didn't have blonde hair and blue eyes. i'm brown. the kids called me dark chocolate and said dark chocolate was disgusting (implying that i'm disgusting). i remember some girls saying they wouldn't drink from the same water fountain as me because i'm brown. (ironically right after we learned about mlk). i honestly think that me growing up completely aware that the other kids thought i was different made me not want to hang out with white kids. i was scared of them. i don't think kids are all that innocent. now i have tons of friends of all backgrounds but back then i felt like i didn't belong.
i bet you have cone nipples. sounds like something only cone-nipple scum would say.
there's a lot of stories in here from (adult) folk that are like, "i didn't/don't even think of them as black/indian/etc!". there's even one girl saying it didn't click that her best friend since kindergarten was asian until they'd graduated *high school*. it's all very noble, but it seems a little ignorant. i'm white too, but a majority of my friends are east and southeast asian (either by descent or from those regions). i think they'd all be kind of annoyed if i told them, "i don't even think of you as asian!". most of them are pretty proud of their families' various traditions and cultures, and actively engage with them. with one of my groups especially, a shared love is food, and we all dig introducing new food to each other. so if i were to be like, omg, i forget you're malaysian (or whatever), yeah, i'd kinda be ignoring an important part of their identities. same if i took literally zero interest in their families and traditions.
me and my best friend in preschool got into a heated argument because he said he was black, while i insisted he was brown.... we referred to the all-knowing box of crayolas to settle our argument.
apparently when i was 4, my parents asked me about a new friend i made, and one of them said "what colour is he?" and i said "kids don't have colours". but then a friend of mine's cousin grew up in a very white town, and when she saw a black guy for the first time when she was 4 in a parking lot she said "what's wrong with that man's skin?" - all depends where you grow up i guess.
i've never understood this. i'm as white as they come, but i've never had the desire to touch a black person's, or anyone's, hair. that's just basic personal space rules. especially if i don't even know them. i've also never seen someone just feel up a black person's hair. hell, the only reason i'm even aware of the issue is because people have mentioned it on the internet. personally i'd be weirded out too if a stranger just came up and touched my hair.
is it rude for black people to touch eachothers hair? i never thought about blavk hair as a kid. but i did love rubbing my hands through a white boys hair in my class...it was shaved and felt like velvet! i was pretty excited when i discovered it.
not really. she was curious about how i saw my friend.
every once in a while i cross paths with a redditer that i want to have a beer with. today, you're that redditer.
depends on the diversity of the environment doesn't it? if there's a class of 20 kids and they're all white other than one black kid they'll become aware of that fact sooner or later, and different treatment may or may not result. with an even mix of races i think it's as you say and it'd never be a problem.
i remember in kindergarten a kid didn't want to me to stand next to him in red rover because he thought my skin was gross and didn't want to hold my hand.
yep, i don't think kids really see skin color. or rather they see it, but it doesn't mean anything to them. my first boyfriend was in fifth grade. when my mom asked about him, i listed off a bunch of stuff. "he's in my class. he's really smart, and he has glasses like me! his hair is short. we hang out at recess." it didn't even occur to me (a little white girl) to mention that he was black.
i love the responses that show people didn't read the whole comment lol
the moment the internet shows you that you aren't the only one missing psych
you guys are disgusting. dont you guys see the problem? colors and white shouldnt mix! how are you supposed to wash the black sweatshirt when its part black part white, it totally throws off the laundry system
keep that in mind after next season. this is the brown's year coming up.
it was about this time they realised she was 500 feet tall, and from the paleolithic era.
when i was growing up i was the only white kid at my school and everyone i knew that was white was my family. so when another girl joined our school in 2nd grade that was also a white blonde girl i thought we were related.
my best friend when i was 4 had just moved from portugal and couldn't speak french (my mother tongue) and i had no idea until i was told at a later age. i remember playing with him but never realized we spoke two different languages.
once i was in tennessee with my black family, and we were all sitting on a bench outside eating some ice cream. a cute little white girl walks by with her parents, stares at us with wide eyes, and goes "mommy are they real?" her parents looked so embarrassed because it was obvious she had never seen black people before. we thought it was hilarious though, still laugh about it to this day.
i didn't used to see the colour of someone's skin as a kid either. kids aren't born racist, this is yet another proof of that :)
my sister said that her best friend was chocolate when she was in preschool! then we asked what she was (we're mexican) and she said "chocolate milk."
oh god, he also said that for awhile afterward. "that guy was like chocolate" or something along those lines (this was like 6 or so years ago he is almost 10). we also have a 10 month old so we can relive all those fun scenarios.
oh my god, i feel so bad for the bagger, and the dad, that would be so embarrassing/shitty.
oh, good. i was expecting it to be an intolerance story.
every day i cross paths with a redditer that i want to buy me a beer.
there are dozens of us!!! jk, psych was a really good show and almost all of my friends that i recommended it too loved it. i'm sure there are a countless number of fans that miss it. too bad i didn't get enough attention when it was on air :'(
what? what's stopping you? is this a *race* thing? /s
it's sad to see this slowly dying. used to see it all the time, now i rarely see it and when i do people don't even include a hyperlink. probably one of the most meta things in reddit history
if they get caught, bribing with 'bout tree fiddy is enough to let them off the hook.
my biological family is white, but i have four adopted cousins who are korean. my little brother was eight years old when he heard me refer to the anniversary of a cousin's adoption day at which point he angrily screamed at me "what do you mean rob is adopted??" he was very upset we "hid it" from him.
when i was about 5 i was a huge whoopi goldberg fan and loved all her movies. someone in my class claimed to be related to some celebrity so me being this giant ass whoopi fan was all "yeah whoopi's actually my cousin" too just because i also wanted to be a bit cool and trounce this other girl's connections. absolutely nobody questioned me over the fact that i'm a light skinned latina and whoopi is not.
my 4yo nephew plays with a boy from germany when he comes to visit occasionally (his dad is a friend of my dad's). they don't understand a word of what the other is saying except for words like 'batman". their conversations are a mix of english, german and constantly repeating names of superheroes. it's so amazing and hilarious to see.
oh jesus, this is kind of a relief... raising a kid in a town that's like 98-99% white, i'm terrified of the moment this inevitably happens to me. i just hope that whoever is on the other end is understanding and has a sense of humor like i would about it. i grew up in this town, and we had 3 black kids and a handful of hispanics in my graduating class of 400. really friendly community, we're just not exactly the most ethnically diverse...
i was 5yrs when i realised my asian face was different from my caucasian friends. i always knew my skin was a browny colour and they were a different colour and i could tell you by rote where i came from so i could answer all the curious people, but i almost fell off the stool when i realised that my face was different to theirs and would never be like theirs. it was like when all the 00011101010's drop away in the matrix.
yup. my mother always likes to tell the story of when i was about three years old. i overheard my mom and her sister talking about my cousin and they mentioned he was black and i ran over to her and yelled "why didn't you tell me [cousin] was black?!"
"they *taste* like chocolate too, but you'll find that out when you're older."
it was so awful, especially because it went on for so long (basically, the entire time it takes to ring through a cart full of groceries). and the dad was clearly trying to ignore it, but the son kept looking for some sort of acknowledgment.
also as a person that works in a preschool classroom, it's a developmental marker to know if things are the same or different.
i'm white and my cousin's chinese. not always a good indicator.
same boat but i'm the only asian in a very mixed family. i didn't realize just how different i looked until 6th grade. i was looking at the class photo,mwhich was just a collage of all of our individual pics and had a hard time finding myself. i was completely stunned.
that doesn't sound right, but i don't know enough about black people to dispute it.
-ruth from blawnox. sent 4 minutes ago from her basement potty.
yup. this is how we get well-meaning white people who don't think the experiences of people of color actually happen since they haven't experienced anything like that. it makes sense in a way; it's easier to notice that the boss always cuts you off and defers to a white person with less experience than to notice that the boss asks for your opinion a lot.
okay, so now that this is official, when can i watch gay divorce court?
and gays across the country who have been relying on "hey, i'd love to get married, but it's not legal" woke up to a *really* awkward conversation.
i've been using the whole "i won't get married until the gays can" excuse with my girlfriend. gentleman, it's been a privilege playing with you.
my facebook will never be the same after this week. i'm going to buy stock in popcorn and butter, y'all.
i wonder how many gays ran to their partners like yea we can get married now.... and their partner is like..... fuck
rip pastor in texas who said he would light himself on fire when this day came..
my mom is pretty conservative and just asked if this was good or bad news. of course it's good news, mom. other people are happy and it doesn't affect or hurt you in anyway. literally free happiness.
hmm, that's odd. the earth is still spinning. it doesn't make any sense.
shit. first people start taking down the confederate flag, then they uphold the affordable care act, and now this. now i'm going to have to endure the most insane bitching and moaning from my crazy bigoted family when i go home for 4th of july. couldn't this have waited a few weeks? thanks obama!
i just started crying at work. my wife and i had to go to california to get married, but in our state we had no protections as a married couple. that ends today and i couldn't be happier about it. time to go get my name changed, suck it texas.
let's see... my son was born, fallout 4 announced and releasing, gay marriage legalized.... 2015 will go down as the best year ever.
wait... is this it? it happened, we're done? on to weed legalization and alternate energy?
i'm irrationally happy about this as a straight man.
as a heterosexual man i am appalled. this ruling affects my life fundamentally. oh wait, it doesn't at all. congrats to all those who have waited decades for this ruling. it's about damn time.
just in time for pride weekend here in minneapolis. shit's gonna be extra rockin'.
they didn't legalize it. they found that the fourteenth amendment didn't allow same-sex marriage bans or bans on their recognition. it's a beautiful day.
so... gay marriage legalized, obamacare taken care of... what is the republican platform going to be for the next election?
great! now, can we *finally* stop calling it same-sex marriage? it's just marriage now. no distinction is to be had. it's just marriage. please, do everyone affected by this (that is, all couples who can now legally marry) a **huge** favor and make a conscious effort to not use the term 'same-sex marriage'.
man, it is a tough week for conservatives... abstinence-only advocate bristol palin gets knocked up again out of wedlock, aca wins in the supreme court, confederate flags getting pulled down, and now this!
im just sitting here watching ops karma rise by the second...
only someone miserable with their own shitty life would try and deny 2 other people from getting married
first upholding the affordable care act and now this? they are crushing it lately.
i just moved out of utah a few months ago for a few different reasons, the cultural environment being one of them. i am laughing my ass off at all the religious butthurt some people are going to have about this and crying with joy at the same time for love finally won. pride weekend here in minneapolis is going to be off the fucking wall.
yup, there had been cases in the past about marriage and infertility.
of all shows, white collar did an excellent job of showing this. one f the side characters was lesbian, and she had a life partner. they had the "if it was legal" discussion. then it became legal in the show. then they broke up. it was a fascinating dynamic, actually. and that season was a several years ago.
please go backpacking here when marijuana is up for legalization
man, i live in san francisco so i get no drama at all. just happiness and celebration. what a bummer.
confederate flag removal, obamacare subsidies upheld now gay marriage is legal everywhere. somebody better call and put the entire south on suicide watch.
this would be me. lol i'd go down to the courthouse tomorrow, but he has dreams of a huge wedding on the beach with like 1000 guests and a weekend-long extravaganza and like, i don't want to pay for that shit. it's an absurd expense.
i know. it's a shame. i really loved my wife. i loved her more than life itself. but this morning when i woke up that love was just gone. then i read this and i realized what happened. i'm going to miss her so much. i hope my new husband can cook half as well as she does.
as the spokesperson for the gay mafia, i am here to inform you all that we will be celebrating the destruction of bristol palin's marriage by spreading the gay agenda, corrupting america's youth and destroying the sanctity of marriage in the town square at noon. cupcakes will be served. we haven't been this excited since we caused hurricane katrina 10 years ago.
felt the heat from that burn while wading in the pacific ocean.
"it is so ordered." i know that's probably required legalese, but that really does come across as: "it's fucking done and over with... no more arguing, children, to your rooms."
whoa, the last two sentences gave me chills. anthony kennedy is my hero
that's really all we wanted all along, to be better than australia.
i used to live in a city that was mostly conservative before i moved to a liberal campus (and then liberal city for my job). by now, most of my conservative "friends" have defriended me for being too pro-lgbt. well fuck them. today is a good day. my entire facebook wall is rainbows and i fucking love it.
some of scalia's dissent is bizarre. this from page 8: "(huh? how can a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives [whatever that means] define [whatever that means] an urgent liberty [never mind], give birth to a right?)" do judges normally write like that?
what the fuck is scalia talking about? did he have a stroke while writing his dissent?
i also live in texas, and my parents can finally be married now!!! it's a happy day for the southern lgbt world!
my roommate is gay and he is gonna be super thrilled. /high five you guys waited long enough.
well my situation is almost completely opposite. i woke up this morning to all of this and when i told my mom she turned around with the biggest look of disgust i've seen and said "did they really". not in a good way either. then my dad spouted off something that made no sense that their must be more gays than straight people. made me remember why i want to move out so bad and will be soon. also i'm straight but still i can't fucking stand blind hatred of things that have no real reason to be disliked. also the end times are almost here according to my mother. -_-
i am also heterosexual and outraged. how am i supposed to explain to my child that two people of the same gender love each other and that's okay? wait, i just answered my own question...
it's pride week pretty much everywhere, right? because of the stonewall riots june 28 1969.
i think the point is that states are having their power taken away and that goes against his interpretation of the constitution.
or, if you live in a state like mine, an exciting drag into the current century. edit- mississippi, for everyone asking
technically, but functionally it's the same thing, right? in fact, you could say they legalized it by banning the banning of it.
isn't that effectively the same thing? if you can't ban it then you're legalizing it, right?
this is actually good for the gop, in a sense, because they no longer have the gay marriage issue hanging over their heads. the scotus took care of that. so one of their contentious issues is no longer a problem.
jeez fine. picky picky. i'll go hop in my same-sex jeep, head over to lesbian breakfast and celebrate my "marriage".
personally, i can't believe this passed with a narrower margin than the obamacare ruling yesterday. i knew it would pass, but who would have thought obamacare would have a bigger margin?
and scalia can't get any saltier. seeing him squirm is satisfying.
an honest question: why are you homophobic? i ask because it's difficult for me to understand *why* someone would feel this way, despite understanding it may be a negative thing to think/feel.
i think it was specifically marriage and *contraception*, not sure about *infertility*. same reasoning applies, regardless.
living in louisville is interesting, it's a northern-ish city in a mostly southern state. so i get a get a pretty good mix of people freaking out on both ends of the spectrum whenever something like this happens.
cook? with the combined incomes of 2 gay males, you'll be eating caviar off the washboard abs of chippendale dancers.
will you be forcibly penetrating me and turning me gay any day now?
explain this joke for an englishman whose only has the vaguest concept of who or what a bristol palin is?
kennedy, who wrote the *windsor* opinion two years ago.
i think "so" should have been in italics, to stand with the gay community.
i love the finality. it's not often in modern times that you see such a righteous, absolute decree.
it's our nation's rallying cry. we whisper "dream of being better than australia" to our children every night as we tuck them in.
i have a cuckoo uncle who, during one christmas dinner, warned me and my cousins that if we weren't wary and careful, when gay marriage passed, we would all be forced to have a "homosexual experience". one of my cousins laughed, thinking it was a joke. he hasn't talked to her since. the funny thing is, the son of that uncle insists that he's closeted.
the funny thing is that every single supreme court decision--and most lower court decisions--always have phrases like that that make you scratch your head and that you have to think about to really understand. anyone can just sit there and say "huh? you make-a no sense" but that doesn't mean there isn't a meaning there.
since there's nothing wrong with the merits of this decision he decided to go full internet troll and attack the style instead.
it's legal now. you don't have to keep calling him your "roommate."
i tried explaining it to my 7 year old daughter and the response i got was, "does that mean i can marry my friend mary?" i said sure, but you might want to graduate first and get a job.
or if have grandparents like mine, a good step towards modern thinking
yes, but it's even stronger than that. if congress had simply passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, a later session could repeal it. instead, the supreme court has decided that no law can ban same-sex marriage, this making it safe from future legislation. same-sex couples should now be able to breathe a sigh of relief, as it is just a matter of time until individual state bans are challenged and wiped from the books.
yep, been saying the gop needed to drop social issues for a long time.
the same thing we do every election cycle, pinky. shriek with impotent rage.
anyone who paid attention to the obamacare case knows that it was not long for the court anyways. it was a semantics argument on word usage in a very esoteric part of the bill. it was not the fundamental healthcare knock-down drag-out fight the media made it out to be.
i honestly don't know but it just really makes me uncomfortable and the idea of gay sex freaks me out. i have a strange sense of self perception and am aware of most of my character flaws.
yeah! no more wage gap dragging your combined income down!
kennedy has written each of the court's gay rights decisions (*romer*, *lawrence*, *windsor*, and now *obergefell*).
it's not that it's funny, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. these people who are very vocally anti-gay talk like it's just one slip up and everyone will be forced to be gay. they talk like this because they have deep feelings of attraction to the same sex, but have been told it is wrong for their whole life. so they need to be on guard to protect themselves from this gay feeling which is what they think the gays want to exploit. since they are themselves gay or bisexual they don't understand that straight people don't actually feel sexual attraction to the same sex. so all this guilt and confusing feelings that they don't understand are not present in most people leads to this.
he also (page 6) holds that a californian is not a westerner (as in the west of the usa, not 'the west'). he further says the opinion of the majority "is couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic" (page 7) and that it is full of "mummeries and straining-to-be-memorable passages" (page 4). not especially classy.
when i had this same discussion with my 7 year old step son, he said he was probably going to marry a boy because "they're more fun." i said, "whatever floats your boat, son. just remember to marry someone you like."
or if you have in-laws like mine, this is an abomination.
we have to wait 100 years before it's de jure legalized. for now it's de facto legalized.
the gop's biggest issue is that they have to win a primary full of people who are against these types of things. case and point: mitt romney, the governor, and mitt romney, the presidential candidate.
i think so, brain, but how are we going to afford a bigger military and promise to reduce taxes without negatively effecting the citizenry?
thank you for writing this. this actually is really helpful in understanding the ruling. they didn't strike down same-sex marriage bans because they affected gay people, but because they affected marriage.
lawrence, windsor, and obergefell have all been announced on june 26th (2003, 2013, 2015).
don't forget my favorite part: scalia in his dissent likens the majority decision's first sentence to "replacing a 'well-reasoned' argument with the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie." so to be clear, justice scalia just lost a legal argument against a fortune cookie.
he's more of a hobophobe, given that he's a-ok with homosexuality as long as you are supporting yourself.
who, day and night, must scramble for a living, feed a wife and children, say his daily prayers?
or if you are like me, young straight dude, then it is kind of a "oh, cool... glad we are doing that. alright where are the production reports?"
it's de jure not illegal, but it is de jure illegal to make it de jure illegal, which makes it de facto legal. can we agree on this?
always felt gop really effed over romney, in reality he's much more moderate but they made him toe the party line.
for some reason "hobophobe" sounds like a scientific word. like something an astronomer would say. can a linguist explain why i feel this way? thanks.
or, even if you're still a young straight dude, it's still exciting that this has finally happened. this is historic.
well you see, the reports were supposed to be done. but qa hasn't signed off on them yet.
if i send you 34.0 gold as a gift, i think your opinion of me will be high enough to agree on this.
man, the guy that made this account really could have used this advise.
name me keeper of the swans and invite me to your party, then we'll see.
he is either having a great day or about to go on a homicidal rampage.
all the exhaust from the surrounding vehicles addled his brain.
you gotta entertain yourself somehow. the other day, i was on my normal commute home from work. there was some traffic. not stand still, but moving pretty slow. i'm next to this car in the other lane that has those sensors in the side view mirror that can detect whether a car is in it's blind spot or not. so for a good 10-15 minutes, i was dropping back into this guys blind spot so it would go on, and then moving forward so it would go off. i hope i didn't piss off the driver, but i had fun.
the quality of your day is largely determined by the attitude you have towards the things you can't control.
is lane-splitting illegal there? i don't normally lane-split because it takes more concentration and is more tiring (for me) but standstill traffic is when i get out of my confort zone and channel my inner rossi.
the personification of traffic jams. he's so happy.
i have to admit i'm also guilty of doing a little toe tapping in traffic. the long stride move when moving slow is fun. although, the little rapid run move he/she did is new to me.
the sad truth is that bikers taken out of their natural habitat (the open road) and confined in traffic have been known to sway and make those motions to keep themselves entertained.
this is me. i'm always bopping around when i'm on my bike. i'm on my bike! how could i not be happy?? also, it helps to have bluetooth in the helmet, so i can rock out while i ride.
that's not him being happy, he's bored as shit wishing he was moving faster.
this is exactly me when i'm stuck in traffic, to make matters more interesting my old bikes charging system drains the battery at idle..... and i have an air cooled motor..... which leads to me actually turning off the bike then scrambling to kick start it when traffic picks up.
anyone who has never owned a motorcycle should... at least once in their life. they are kinda dangerous but it is a unique feeling riding a motorcycle in traffic... i always felt like the road was more "mine" than everyone else... like i was more connected to the world than all these people in oblivious boxes. its just fun to ride a motorcycle.
maybe going on a homocidal rampage is a great day for him.
he's on a motorcycle, of course he's having a great day.
well he lives in hawaii so i'd go with the first one.
that would only make the little light on the mirror turn on. it only beeps at you if you have your turn signal on *and* there is a car in the vicinity. at least, that's how it works in my wife's hyundai and my toyota. but hey, it kept you entertained so mission accomplished.
sitting in that traffic with those massive gaps between cars must be utterly maddening! in the uk we get maybe 75cm between cars and it's still good to filter through traffic!
in the us lane splitting is only legal in california, unfortunately.
my inner californian was screaming: "argh! just ride the line!"
oklahoma lane splitting: illegal helmets: optional wtf oklahoma?
as far as i know lane-splitting is illegal in the usa, excepting california. i think it is legal in most other places in the world. coming from japan to the us, i'm still getting used to not being able to do it.
probably not, most places its not. i also don't lane split after a hefty ticket
can confirm... my commute sucks, except when i ride my motorcycle.
yep, waiting in line for a stop light is a pleasure while i'm on my bike. so many drum solo's on my gas tank
my thing is i try to stay up without putting my feet down as long as possible. i want to build the balance so i can just come to a red light and sit there without putting one foot down. or sometimes i lean the bike to each side and push up with my leg. can be a decent leg workout since the bike is over 600 lbs, just don't lean too far...
another motorcyclist here chiming in. being stuck in traffic on a bike is the worst. you have to be holding the clutch in most of the entire time. often stalling and restarting if traffics not going fast enough. the engine can get very hot between your legs too. i don't think this guy was having as much fun as everyone thinks, he more than likely was super annoyed.
one time when i was stuck in bad traffic i pulled off to the side of the road and pushed my bike along the sidewalk faster than the cars were moving. very satisfying.
i have a big air-cooled v twin....it melts my legs in traffic. i went to france and saw how some people handle their bikes their, even big american bikes.opened my eyes to how freeing riding could be with just a few slight tweaks of the law
was really nervous about getting my bike... do i really want a dangerous hobby? will i keep it up? am i going to keep riding this big ass 1300cc cruiser? after a little riding i realized yes to all 3. so much fucking fun. ever since i've been riding 6 days out of the week on average. this is literally the most fun hobby i've ever had.
legal or not... when traffic is like that, i invoke california rules.
had to scroll down too far to find this fact lost amongst all the cager posts
children, animals, old people, it doesn't matter; i just love killin'!
except he's going west on the h1 in rush hour. that's not a great day.
that kicks ass! when i'm at a standstill, i wait till i can tell someone is looking at me and then i over-dramatically (like really theatrically) pick my nose. we're talking hand straight out, like i'm conducting, then rolling that declarative finger back slowly towards your raised eyebrow (think billy madison, do you have anymore gum face), really building some tension. then i pretend to be horrified as i look at my fingertip. then, i turn, ever so slowly, still wide-eyed, towards them. if it gets a laugh, they get a cute little wave. if no laugh, i stare awkwardly until either one of us can move again. i'm in a car for two hours a day on average.
i've wondered this for a while so it doesn't do much good for people who don't signal
it's not because of space issues that we don't allow lanesplitting in most of the u.s. it's the lack of awareness by drivers in cars and knowledge of the legality of lanesplitting.
for me zipping through traffic is one of the main reasons to *have* a bike. it knackers your clutch hand sitting in traffic, it would drive me bonkers.
yeah, those anti-splitting laws are ridiculous and kinda ignorant. it should be allowed under certain circumstances, say in stopped traffic, on highways, and with maximum 20kph speed difference to surrounding traffic.
and it is so common, drivers are more aware of their presence, get over in their lanes to give them space, and are less likely to run them over. but yeah, its dangerous. half the accidents in sd during rush hour are motorcycle involved because the out-of-state transplants haven't quite got it figured out yet.
in *most places* in the world, it is. in the usa, it is now explicitly legal in one state (california, previously it was simply not illegal to share lanes) and not illegal in one other state (possibly new jersey, but i don't remember), but the police there will ticket you for failure to maintain control, illegal land change, or whatever else they feel like.
definitly miltary, who else would wear a reflective vest and pants on the h1 mid day. probably skating out of work hence the happiness lol.
yup, got bluetooth in my new helmet and it's a compete game changer. i sing so loudly when i'm riding.
the only time commuting on a motorcycle sucks is the rain or 110+ temps. actually had a gas fountain once from my tank because it was so hot.
every time anything motorcycle related makes it to the frontpage we get a bunch of vinegar-pissing idiots like you complaining.
yeah all the people going "look how happy he is!" have never considered dying out of boredom in a traffic jam. this must be how dolphins in an aquarium feel.
out of curiosity, how did you start? i've thought about getting one, but it seems like anyone i know that rides a motorcycle learned how to ride it from using dirt bikes as a kid; i don't know how to learn as an adult.
what operation? i find someone goofing about on a bike and post it, i wouldn't waste resources on cheating this post to the front page, what could i possibly gain? it would be no different posting these on this account or an account with no karma, it isn't benefiting me
omg you ride a motorcycle. do you know that you're going to die? /s welcome to reddit.
you know what that means, a whole afternoon at blitz and chiiiiiiiipz!
i'm a motorcyclist who's been down a few times, but i've seen far worse. had a friend whose life changed forever after he was dying on the ground in front of me, his body shattered damn near everywhere. i'll never forget coming up on an accident scene and seeing a motorcyclist on the ground, his legs bent into a pretzel, asking me over and over if he could stretch out his legs so he'd get more comfortable, me knowing that he couldn't. you don't forget seeing all those body parts aiming the wrong way. you can't wipe that out of your head. i ride a lot less now than i used to.
are you a man or a woman? i pictured a dude the whole time until "cute little wave". now i am uncertain.
plus, lane markers are pretty distinct to hawaii in my experience, and i'm pretty sure that's the aloha stadium in the background.
wait...did you just say that it's not allowed because people don't know if it's allowed?
everyone who visits bitches non stop about it. it's like, "if you just stay in your lane and look in your rear view/side mirror when you change lanes, or whenever you usually do, there won't be a problem. they're not trying to ruin your day or wreck or make you wreck. stop freaking out" but of course they are never the problem and it's the "maniac" folks on motorcycles.
oh nice, don't remember hearing about wa. i wish more states would finally catch up. md traffic is terrible, and splitting would probably cut my commute in half.
shit i use a cheap pair of earbuds. tried buying a bluetooth helmet radio but the prices were too hi for me.
pretty much, ive been pretty hesitant in getting a bike because of that.
this is reddit, i'm pretty sure most people here are afraid to go outside.
you could say it broke down. no law that i know of against pushing a broke down vehicle.
if it isn't benefiting you in some way whats the point?
sterling archer has ditched the tactical turtleneck for a more unconventional attire.
i actually have always wanted to learn to ride a motorcycle but always been a little scared of being hit by someone not paying attention and thrown 20 feet. but i guess that's not very likely to happen. yes i am a naturally paranoid person.
i like the merging of the two that i've heard, donorcycles.
at that point you just don't drink milk... almond, soy, or coconut milk and creamer would be in my fridge.
and ordering the #1 at mcdonalds is a spam burger that costs $8?
scrolled back up to see a hawaii license plate....i've never seen one, and for a brief moment wondered why. then i remembered.

i don't imagine pushing a vehicle is illegal. some roads have a minimum speed, but that's out the window in a jam. i'm wondering about pushing it on a sidewalk.
is it surprising, though? welcome to the internet, my good friend. it's a wild ride cruising the web. may the blue links become purple for you
if by "strange" you mean "incredibly annoying because i just watched a little bitch cry about his situation for 30 minutes instead of manning up and doing something about it," then i totally agree.
if as many people spent as much time sky/scuba diving as motorcyclists do on the road, you hear similar conversation about the divers.
you think that's cheaper? you're on an island. everything is shipped in. almost nothing is made locally.
i saw one in massachusetts, i have no idea how the fuck that happened. did they move and ship their car? did i catch it in the tiny window before they need to change plates? were they just fucking with everyone? so many questions.
dude, i got 50 mpg on a 650 beating it senseless around town. on a 300? i bet you could pull 70 easy, and some claim up to 90. i mean, i know they pollute terribly, likely to kill me, and utterly impractical for anything outside the city, but goddamn i love motorcycles.
not that bad of an influence though, that comment wasn't split up into 13 parts.
there's no way hawaii doesn't have local coconut milk
i've known several people who moved to and from hawaii in the early 90's. each did it by renting a shipping container and filling it up with everything they owned/wanted to bother taking; each of them also put their cars in the containers. no idea what the real logistics of this are or if people still do it.
it's not horribly expensive to ship a car to the mainland. i've got a friend who did that to his dad's truck. i want to say it comes in under a grand to ship from california to hawaii, one way. you're not allowed to have anything inside the car, so no piggybacking to ship other things too. oh, and military relocations will include shipping cars.
i just picked up an fz09... i'm not expecting to make it to the end of the year before i kill myself but it sure will be fun.
i'm optimistic, it looks like her backpack was pulled down and took the brunt of it. she's still gonna hurt for a while but it could have been way worse, her tramp stamp may have survived!
that's just not right. you don't drink coconut milk just like that. albeit some desserts require fresh coconut milk, you don't drink it by the glass. disgusting
and at least she's wearing suitable clothes. the amount of people i've seen riding around in shorts and singlets recently is ridiculous.
that wasn't his reaction time, that was his girl friend acting as his brake s
in the version with sound, you can here the guy screaming "goddammit!!" at the top of his lungs. he doesn't really come off as caring a single bit for the girl. i think he was more upset about the possible damage to the bike.
looks like she had her spine shredded not her ass goddamn
i love drinking coconut milk fresh out of a coconut and then eating the coconut meat from the inside. a+ snack.
this may be the only case i heard of where the west creates something fake for the chinese.
in modern china there is a high priority placed on perceived value of things. they should sell this at a higher cost and market it as a premium version because it is not tainted by anything a wild rhino has eaten or done. eventually they can then introduce a cheaper version and push the actual horns out of the market. sort of the tesla business model.
this is a great idea and plan but why the fuck would you announce it? just quietly implement your plan and watch their market implode. *loose lips sink ships*
hi! matthew from pembient here, one of the cofounders of the startup in this article. thanks for all of the support! we will be here on monday morning doing an ama, so we're looking forward to discussing, answering questions, and keeping up the conversation on this important topic!
if only we could have done this before the rhinos were fucked
maybe it's finally time to look into that ivory tower i've always wanted...
to make it lasting business i'd add a little extra, say opium or viagra. just to get them hooked,
so can one tell between the "authentic" and the "fake" or not? that seems to be the only point that matters here.. if people will know which are fake and which are real then the company is not flooding the rhino horn market.. they are flooding the *fake rhino horn*, but obviously that has no affect on the real one. if on the other hand people cannot tell between the two then there is only one rhino horn market and flooding it will achieve the affect they desire. the article does not really seem to say either way.
i'd say the current anti-poaching methods are a complete failure. try flooding the market.
how can the prospective buyer even tell the difference if they're the same material?
yeah, that will abolish rhino slaughter just like synthetic diamonds have abolished blood diamonds.
"international rhino foundation" says poo poo to the notion of their own obsolescence.
to actually cut demand for real rhino horns, they need to play this up: that the synthetic is more pure and more potent for less cost. then soon folks will be demanding synthetic.
this is pretty interesting. it seems that both ideologies have their merit. on one hand you think you can flood the market and reduce demand, on the other you flood the market and increase authenticy demand. the real question is, do we have the rhino population to really determine whether it helps or not if for some reason this idea doesn't work out so well? i don't think we do.
absolutely. all jokes aside, this technological capability may be huge for animal conservation. let's hope it takes hold, and serves to undercut the illegal market. maybe in 10 or 20 years from now, we will see this market completely destroyed. we can hope.
if that works people will do it though. store owners will buy the fake stuff at 1/8 price and then sell it to people at full price. rhino poachers still won't be able to sell to store owners unless they really undercut the price. people are wondering "what if store owners buy the real thing and really advertise that they have the real stuff?" but the beauty of it is that if you can't tell the difference, store owners with the fake stuff will just lie
i really like this idea and i am hopeful it could work well but i am not convinced. jewelry companies have been largely successful in promoting "real" diamonds, as opposed to those artificial ones that don't have natural flaws and impurities in them. then again, black market sellers won't have the same level of marketing campaign as de beers does.
i think there's a certain amount of merit to your way of thinking. manufacturing safer purer synthetic replacements for prohibited substances rather than just banning them could effectively deal with a number of issues.
it is different because cocaine actually does something. there is no way to tell real horn from fake horn based on use, because they don't do anything.
because nobody is going through all that trouble just for the sake of altruism. they want the publicity.
if they're publicly traded then they are just looking for investors so that they can cash in and jump ship because they know this is not going to work anyways.
all mammals except humans and those we cultivate for food or pets are fucked anyway.
ivory comes from tusks/teeth, which are formed by dentine, a bone like tissue. rhino horns are solid keratin (unusual among horned animals), which is what forms your hair and fingernails.
oh yes because a western nation getting the chinese people hooked on opium worked out so well the last time we did it
you pay me enough money and i'll walk around with a pack of rhinos and snipe any mother fucker that comes close to them, sell their bodies to science and make a poaching science museum to where people and come and see all the failed attempts at being a complete asshole
pretty easily actually. two things to consider: 1. 3d printing techniques are not flawless, a look under a microscope can reveal the the layers of the printing process. 2. as the lab claims, these synthetic horns are more 'pure' than real rhino horns. there are many reagent tests that can determine if a contaminate is present. if the test comes back negative for contaminates, it's likely a lab made. tl;dr authenticity can easily and cheaply be proven.
are synthetic (not cz but actual man made diamonds) 1/8 the price of normal ones? i can't seem to get a good read on prices from a quick google search
they could be right. i know it's a bit of a stretch, but look at the watch business. before the 70s, mechanical watches were tools. necessary. there was a whole market of those tools. then the quartz crisis happened, where it became possible to make cheap watches that were even more accurate. of course that undercut completely the companies making mechanical watches. those companies repositioned onto the high-end, the luxury market. now, mechanical watches have never been so expensive. those companies make great results. now back on the rhino. you might change the poacher's market from a basic merchandise one, to a luxury one. and their profits would soar.
i don't think that will be the case. the horns have no actual medicinal properties, what the customer wants is a horn that came from a rhino.
sell horns to poachers. they'll provide as much proof of authenticity as ever at far less personal risk
china sells knock off for profit as the real thing already with everything else. of course it will work. they will convince themselves it's real
seriously, going after the poachers is treating the symptoms. this is annihilating the actual problem by making the horns worthless.
people will still want the authentic ones, it probably won't work. same way people don't buy synthetic diamonds.
the art market will love it as well. i love doing scrimshaw but it is pretty much illegal to get any horn or tooth which makes it incredibly hard to keep the art up. a legal set of teeth (small whale) can cost upwards of 500 to a grand. so if they did this with tusk or teeth and the price dropped 1/8 it would be amazing. instead of a $800 paying $100 would definitely shift a market. there will always be people who prefer 100% real, but meh.
what you're also missing is that this tech could, in theory, be used to print genetically compatible, reject resistant, bones for humans.
right, if you are selling parts of an endangered and illegal to hunt animal you likely have no issue lying and saying your cheap ass fake stuff is totally legit.
exactly. if i ever invent something awesome i'm sure as hell not going to just not take any credit for it.
i guess they could check for fukushima fall out. the synthetic stuff won't have any.
so, flood the market with cheap, synthetic but pure rhino horn. protect the real rhinos with drones. win - win!
yeah, the "as pure as that of a rhino of 2,000 years ago" part is marketing's way of spinning the fact that these are very basic imitations of a rhino horn lacking many of the features that lend to true authenticity. regardless, i hope it works.
a lot of rhino horn ends up in quack medicines (although i read somewhere that up to 80% of the "medicinal" rhino horn is already fake). so it would be ground up and mixed with other ingredients before it ever got to consumers. the rhino horn dealers who are already selling water buffalo or whatever as "rhino" will now have a powdered horn material that genetically tests as "100% real rhino." this may not affect demand for solid chunks of ivory used for carvings, but it could completely replace medicinal rhino horn. if the horn carvers are no longer able to sell the leftovers from carving to medicine manufacturers, then that's going to cut into their profits a bit.
or the demand will explode among lower class uneducated citizens who couldn't used to afford rhino horns
i think it has more to do with synthetic diamonds still being really expensive.
in my brief google searches they seemed on par in cost with real diamonds. go figure.
the only reason gem quality diamonds are as valuable as they are is that a cartel of very motivated, very resourceful, very wealthy people worked hard to convince us that they are. that cartel continues to use marketing to drive demand for bits of carbon stuck in rings of yellow metal.
i am not an expert but to my understanding, the technology for mass producing gem quality synthetics isn't quite mature enough yet.
you need to do both, though. poachers will poach for as long as they can sell the horns, meat, whatever, if they can do it with impunity. it's a way to make a living in a particularly desperate region of the world.
in reality we could both bring back rhino populations and satisfy the needs of the consumers by farming rhinos. vice did a episode on this (hbo i think) where rhino farmers cut the horns off humanely and they grow back, so its perfectly safe. the only reason rhinos have to die is because poaching is illegal and the poachers have to hack the horns off fast and brutally in order to get in and get out before getting caught. they basically cut half the rhinos face off. farming is the best solution to the problem, kills two birds with one stone.
the point is they can't tell. they are not flooding the market with horns labeled fake, they are gonna sell all fake horns as poachers and claim they are real.
except the same unscrupulous dealer who would sell real rhino horn would gladly sell fake horn and claim it's real.
true, but if the horns are illegal anyway, how are they going to check the authenticity?
maybe, though diamonds are artificially priced higher for the most part.
if we are able to print ivory, it allows for things not possible with natural ivory such as eventually printing a 3'x3'x3' solid ivory block. imagine what you could make with that.
but if you can 3d-print a horn or tooth to make a sculpture out of, you can also just print the sculpture directly.
unless the cops come in case it's absolutely fake and you're just trying to help
what's the deal with the fukushima fall out stuff? are they getting rhinos from japan?
arm them with them with the capacity to inject poachers with potent laxatives while you're at it. give poachers the payload they deserve.
i don't think contaminants are a "feature" of rhino horns. what they want is the material (keratin) that makes up the horn, not the germs and other things that are in there.
rhino horns are made of the exact same material has human fingernails and hairs. how someone can still believe that stuff to cure anything or have magic power in this day and age is beyond all logic.
so then the production will explode too. the biotech company will make lots of money as well. win win.
the microscopic ones used for powertools are cheap as fuck. large diamonds used for jewellery are prohibitively expensive.
when i looked for my wife's ring it was about 2/3 the cost. so i could have gotten a better cut but when you're already spending that much i might as well get the real thing. now if it were half the price then i'd look more seriously at the man made ones. (i mostly looked at the gemesis diamonds)
my wife's fantasy world in her head has been built up by every woman in her family, friends, fairy tales, disney, movies, books, the media... etc. i tried to convince her that it's just a rock to no avail. to some women there's an implied meaning behind real diamonds.
they don't want the meat. they want ivory and horn, it's been like that since the 1800's. kill the elephants and rhinos, saw off their ivory and horns, and sell them to wealthy people. meat rots and needs storage and can only be sold locally. why eat rhino when you can eat cow? this is an utterly brilliant plan. remember, plastic killed demand for ivory (piano keys and billiard balls).
poach the poachers and sell their ground up penises as an aphrodisiac.
that's not really true, though: poachers will poach as long as the reward is worth the risk. the real difference is that, right now, the payoff for poaching rhinos is high enough that desperate people are willing to risk getting shot at for it. do you think they'll still be willing to take that risk if there are safer choices with similar payoffs? of course not, they'd go do something where they wouldn't have to worry about getting shot at.
they also kill the rhino so they don't waste time tracking a rhino with no horn. i read something about dyeing the rhino's horns so poachers wouldn't be able to use them but they'd kill them anyhow so they wouldn't have to be fooled by it again.
if farming was successful it would also bring down the prices, until having a horn isn't as rare and no longer a status symbol.
i'm guessing a rhino needs a pretty large range, and it's hard for them to protect their young from predators without the horn. they're not there for decoration.
most modern scientific advances are a result of scientists skimming reddit for ideas.
this. let's say i can but a real horn for $800 and sell it for $1,600 or i can buy a gmo horn for $100 and sell it for $1,600. 10/10 i'll sell the
that would work if it weren't for the "flood the market" part. you're not going to sell your "real" horn for 1600 if the guys down the street are selling their "real" ones for 1200, 1100, 1000, and 950. so you drop to 900, repeat until worthless.
they will find a way. diamond dealers have found a way to distinguish synthetic from mined diamonds with at least some degree of probability even though they are chemically identical and produced by the same physical process.
for the entire part. diamonds are common in nature; de beers only sells a tiny fraction of their stockpile to keep prices stable.
you could also just print what you were trying to make in the first place instead of printing the solid block.
i've read that all organic things which lived and died before the first nuke tests can be identified by lack of fallout. stuff spreads, not just dangerous stuff but different alletropes of carbon and nitrogen and living things absorb them and now the ratios are out of whack. fukisima is just the most recent addition of this fallout.
fallout is pretty much everywhere, you can identify from which event (fukushima,thernobyl) it was by measuring the half life of the radiation. whine bottles get tested for their cork year by a similar method.
truly, i got no "i'm here to kill the bad guys" vibe from her ama. i felt she was very open and forward about their/her position, actions and m.o. she again and again corrected redditors who used phrases like "hunting poachers".
interestingly almost everyone who said exactly what that seal said in the article got downvoted into oblivion in that ama.
i fully expect poachers to throw out propaganda about how these fake horns are dangerous and could kill you if used in medicine (which is a big thing). it doesn't matter if it's more of what they want, the poachers will very much spread lies to hold their market.
and one can only hope that they spend part of their earnings into protecting rhinos, given the higher demand side effect they will create.
only because debeers wants to guilt you into handing over your pay for two months straight.
this may be a weird question, but do people use the cheaper, smaller synthetic ones and the real diamonds on the same ring? like as secondary diamonds on the side?
very interested in going this route, where'd you buy it?
are you sure it's actually diamond? i've traded them casually for a long time and never ever come across a dealer or wholesaler selling artificial diamonds for any serious discount below mined ones. does it have all the official accreditation and certification which you've verified? if not it's probably not diamond but another similar stone.
honestly, a flawless synthetic diamond, to me, is *more* impressive than one dug out of the ground. anyone can do the latter; the former is a declaration of human scientific and engineering achievement.
the demand for ivory continues to be strong, thanks to the chinese. as for this plan with rhino horn, i am highly skeptical. one of the reasons rhino horn fetches such a high price is because of something known as the "anthropogenic allee effect" in which the more rare something becomes the greater the demand because possession of it becomes a status symbol. it's not the masses who consume the horn, it's the wealthy. they are likely to be discerning and reject something that is fake. if consumers don't believe that the medicinal value of horn itself is fake, why would they accept the scientific basis for the equivalence of synthetic horn? the only way this would work is if the synthetic horn was laundered into the market, but i doubt this lab is going to get involved in such activities.
it kills demand in the general populace, but increases the price of vintage *legal* ivory that the wealthy still fork over a lot of money for. my grandma supposably has a vintage ivory elephant carving (she has a whole wall of different elephant carvings and castings), but she hasn't told anyone which elephant because it could go for a lot of money, and people in puerto rico are desperate for money.
that technology is getting better every day! except maybe weekends. because the scientists who work on developing that technology might not work weekends. and i guess holidays.
man, if we could just print hamburgers, i'd be happy. shit, i'd buy a printer. what a day that would be!
it's only partly a "status symbol". lots of animals go down because of stupid superstitious beliefs and "ancient medicine" nonsense.
in a few weeks: "til scientific uses a cumbox as cheap fertility treatment alternative"
yeah, but if the market is flooded the price will drop. it's not about fake vs. real, it's about price and demand. now people might hoard horns - like the diamond companies - to artificially inflate the price. but i doubt black-market-rhino-horn-sellers could organize themselves well enough.
you're not thinking like a criminal. you're a rhino horn dealer. you get the same knock off stuff as everyone else, but you take a small percentage of it, and claim it's the real thing and sell it for higher prices. "sure, i've got the imitation stuff, right here." looks around, "but if you're interested, i can hook you up with a little of the real stuff." end customers never buy a whole horn, they buy a tiny amount of powdered horn, so they'd have no way to tell. the market being flooded with counterfeits that are indistinguishable from the real thing drastically cuts the price of the real thing. either way, poachers can't afford to sell at the new lower market rates.
de beers, a multi billion dollar group, has exactly two machines in the entire world that can tell a real from a manufactured diamond. and it's not even correct 100% of the time. you really think there's anyone in the horn smuggling network that can do better?
i thought the labs have to engrave the created diamonds?
and de beers can afford -and needs to- have advertising pushes discrediting synthetic diamonds. they're great advertisers (diamonds were exported to the entire society, not just upper classes and made a cultural mainstay), probably better than any set of poachers.
think bigger! pants made entirely from ivory! an ivory duck sculpture to take to your bath with you! ivory underpants the possibilities are endless! :d
message me if you're serious and we can gain authorization from the local government and i'll give you a more competitive contract.
i suspect the poachers will buy these and claim they're real.
i don't think a poacher will risk his life anymore if he is going to be undercut by the dude selling the fake one.
i went through agape diamonds, got a 1 karat ring for around 550, have the certification as well.
100% sure. i'm looking at the certification from american international gemologists right now.
everyone knows p gems are where it's at. 40 of them gets you a high rune. get your girl a lo, jah, ber, or zod rune ring.
until you get halfway through and it stops because your broccoli and asparagus cartridge is empty, and won't continue printing until you replace the unnecessary carts. fuck you hp.
it was hilarious when manufactured diamonds hit the market, they changed their value system from "color cut clarity" to "the same three c's except not *too* clear because we can't dig up diamonds as clear as they make 'em" i bought my wife a manufacture one, it's so clear it actually glows in the dark for a bit after you turn off the lights because the perfect crystal lattice traps light and slows it's release.
probably because she's more masculine than most of the dudes you've been with.
i doubt it considering the plan with these is to flood the market and drive down the cost. if they sold them to the poachers, the poachers wouldn't flood the market so that they could keep prices artificially high. look at debeers and their diamonds.
yeah would it make more sense for said poacher to just become a wholesaler of these synthetic horn, seems safer, more legal, just easier better business
magic and culturally agreed upon value, like us and diamonds. they aren't worth shit unless we agree they are.
right. the same thing that makes real rhino horns better than synthetic rhino horns is what makes tiger penis good for virility, and so on. it's like how people will pay for water that's from the mouth of the ganges river up in the himalayas - how interested will they be in water that's 100% chemically similar with the mineral levels adjusted to match that water? not in the slightest.
the problem isn't at the consumer end, it's at the wholesale end. and it isn't that wholesalers won't want to sell this product. it's that the wholesalers are criminal. the rhino horn trade is run by organized crime. they'd love to buy this cheap knockoff and turn a steep profit, but it's not politically feasible for a legit lab to deal with criminals (who may also be involved in illegal drugs and human trafficking). the pharmacies in vietnam (which may or may not be willing to deceive their customers) have well established relationships with their wholesale suppliers, so there wouldn't be much choice but to engage at the wholesale level.
this is your p.i. what have i told you about being on reddit during ~~work~~ hours? get back to work.
dealing with printer issues sucks so hard, i can't even imagine the horrors a food printer might make with bad drivers.
well, i think diamonds are worthless outside of industrial uses, and thankfully many of my generation agree. i can only hope that culture will destroy debiers or however you spell it.
this is your department chair. what i have i told you about being on reddit when you are supposed to be writing publications and grants. get back to work.
my brother printer actually insisted the color cartridges were draining even though they were never used.
**pilot refuses to land until air traffic controller admits floor isn't lava**
is any one else reminded of a 1990s computer game about a paper plane navigating a house?
i just purchased 6 fans and a ream of paper on amazon
why does everything look superimposed? oh because it is.
this cant be real. can anyone verify this? seems way to amazing to actually work.
am i the only one that heard the flying sounds from super mario world while watching this gif? ewoop ewoop ewoop
why does nothing on this post have a karma rating?
if it's cgi and still has a shitty loop like this. someone fucked up.
how can that plane be real if our eyes aren't real?
easier to use attach a extra thin piece of line that'll be lost in the pixels?
if this is cgi, why did they not make it a perfect loop?
**pilot loses fuel and crashes, kills all on-board**
i feel like a kid again. love this. we need adult 'floor is lava' parties / places.
glider ...great game but frustratingly difficult for me as a kid
and then i had the thought, that i'd actually pay to see this in-person... a paper airplane perpetually flying over a loop of fans.
what the hell are those giant one's in the 1st and 4th gif?
i need eyes like yours. can you point out where to look to see things superimposed in this gif?
it's not real. sometimes people post these things with no explanation and have fun watching others guess. sometimes it's real, but not this time. sometimes i like heating up a small cantaloupe in the microwave, cutting a hole in it, and making love to it slowly for six and a half minutes.
i wasn't suspicious until i realized the big fans were rotating.
same. but to be fair, it's not typical to see cgi outside of movies and tv. right? right?? :(
just look at the shadow in the middle of the plane. 1. it shouldn't be that drastic. 2. it isn't dynamic. 3. consume a phallus (jk, ily).
how do you know the whole room isn't 3d graphics? the shading on the copier in the the back of the room looks conspicuous; all of the reflections look a little too shiny, especially with that perfect reflection of the paper airplane off of the tables; the uniformity in the ceiling light is a little too good; and the black plastics all look a little too.... matte, most black plastic on desk fans and standing fans are actually somewhat shiny.
how can this object move in 3d space if earth is flat?
to do list for when i'm a billionaire: topless 'floor is lava' party with hookers.
my 5th grade classroom had this and oregon trail. all i wanted to do was hunt buffalo, but my caravan never had the space to support my unquenchable thirst for blood.
i've spent more time then i'd like to admit watching this.
the shadow on the plane never changes, it's always on the front inside left.
it's pretty common. check out captain disillusion for more
true, but it would never fool us, and perfect loops are so much more satisfying
why do hookers always get all the fun? jeez, i'm sure a few redditors would enjoy your event, too.
and then i had the thought, that i'd actually pay to see this in-person... a paper airplane perpetually flying over a loop of fans.
i think the fans are oscillating to try to hide this, but if you look at the small black fans and their relation to the door frames or the stand from the oscillating fans you can see they don't change position in relation to one another as the camera moves. which means this was a static shot that had the visible area moved around to give the illusion that the camera is handheld, which for most people makes cgi seem unlikely and also allows the end video to be lower quality, which makes hiding imperfections(and a small part of the reason why some movies look terrible when remastered and put on an hd medium like blue ray)
so instead of simply adding a cgi plane to the existing scene, you would: 1. suspend the plane from a string 2. attach the string to a very fast rail system in the ceiling which you can't see 3. cgi all the fans, one by one are you michael bay?
i sat and watched that for much longer than i'd like to admit.
what about the hands required to make the paper airplane?
for a long time, i thought the line was "i was looking kind of dumb with my finger in my bum" not really related, but i needed to share that with someone.
just out of curiosity - how do you think it would be received, if an american runner finished a marathon with an iranian flag?
"how did you show your support for the us?" "iran."
my dad was going to go see his ailing mother this spring in tehran. i guess we'll just have to hope this blows over by then because otherwise she's going to die without getting to see him
our governments may be enemies, but the iranian people are some of the most modern, well educated, and reasonable in the muslim world. one day i hope both our nation's can have better leadership, and our people can once again be friends.
the hypocrisy of still allowing saudi arabian immigrants into the u.s. is the real story..
so basically i'm off the grid at the moment and have not had access to the internet and haven't watched tv...why did we ban iranians from entering the country? it seems odd to target iranians.
the president shouldn't have restricted people with legal green cards from entering the country. stupid move.
here's the thing...the state of iran may sponsor terrorism, but the majority of the people actually living there are just normal like us! most people want to live and not bother anyone else, and not be bothered. blanket bans don't solve anything!
you know what i know about iran? my friend in high school: her parents emmigrated from iran. actually, her mother's family came here because when she was little, she said she wanted to be a judge and her father said he would do anything to make that possible, so they moved to america. my friend? she speaks multiple languages. she's an ivy-league trained engineer and a computer scientist. now, her aunt can't come visit her other aunt, who is very ill. so glad we're keeping those terrorists out...
reading these comments, i feel like i've found about 500 people whom i'd rather have as president.
trump supporters, you are on the wrong side of history. if there is a modern day anne frank out there somewhere, she is a young syrian refugee girl.
and since you're pointing this out, the actions of the us government, does not reflect the thoughts of many americans.
seems like iran is more deserving of criticism here, since they won't even issue temporary visas to americans for an athletic competition, much less let us immigrate. this protester has guts, but he could very well end up in jail or worse. not to mention the whole stoning-women-to-death thing.
" washington (cnn)the state department on thursday released its annual report on global terrorist activity, listing iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism "
just think of all the summer vacations that now have to changed. there goes that trip to six flags tehran.
i don't think i've ever been more ashamed to be an american.
since iran is now banned, it would do very well because it's politically relevant.
i think it would be received well. many people supported stronger us + iran ties. the anti-us rhetoric in iran has died down substantially and they have complied with un directives. many moderates and feminists are in the iranian parliament. there was an opportunity to forge a good relationship and reform iran into a more open and modern society. compared to the other shit shows like n korea, afghanistan, phillipines, russia and syria, iran now looks like a good potential partner. so obama made a start, but trump will roll it all back and make them a party of the "evil empire" again.
you think americans would actually recognize an iranian flag?
"fucking terrorist supporter!" - the right "fucking anti women rights supporter" - the left "no man's sky sucks" - left leaning moderates
it took me a while to get this joke - i forgot you guys pronounced "iran" as "i ran"
it should also be noted none of the 9/11 terrorists were iranian, just for anyone who didn't already know.
wait so my dad (who is a us and iranian citizen) flew out today because his mother (my grandma) died. does this mean he will be stuck there? update: my dad made it into iran. ill update if/when he gets back. thanks for all the replies
eventually even the ones who voted for him are going to have to admit that... right?!?! someone please tell me i'm right. i've never been embarrassed to be an american before, ever. i was proud. now i'm sad.
i'm a pakistani-canadian muslim and i think that's kinda the "funniest" thing about this ban. everyone knows that iranians are the best educated, most rational, and most liberal of the civilian populations of muslim countries. like they are so obviously the odd man out from those 7 countries.
i'm afghan and i used to live in iran. iran is modern, beautiful, and people are educated. it's funny that afghanistan is not on the list, but iran is.
or full-time workers. or students. or dual-citizenship holders.
yeah i know a woman in the usa right now who is one of the smartest people i ever met, works for a top company in an extremely technical position, has a us born baby, and is now in a shaky position. would 100% be a net loss for the usa if she left and i think she still has options in another first world country.
yeah, but then we have to play, "which president destabilized the region and helped fund her oppressors." was it a) george h. w. bush b) bill clinton c) george w. bush d) barrack obama e) all of the above
then we should stop arming rebel groups that keep fucking murdering innocent people and stop claiming these groups are "moderate".
the people i know that are the most critical of the iranian regime are iranians. they are totalitarian country that abuses it citizens. lovely that america strives to sink to their level.
i'm not ashamed to be an american, i'm a ashamed of my government.
yup. the runner could come in dead-last and it would still be posted all over social media and tv.
it's also extremely easy to just paint iran as an evil theocracy and completely skipping over why it's an evil theocracy. it's obviously impossible to prove, but i honestly doubt it would have ended up as such, if it weren't for us meddling westerners. it's also fairly easy to see why iran isn't exactly trusting towards us or our ideals. sure, we *preach* that we want democracy, but when that gets in the way of our money or resources, you're going to end up with a nice, brutal military dictatorship instead. this does not, of course, alleviate the iranian theocrats from any of their responsibilities in the slightest, but to a certain degree it's like repeated kicking a dog and then only blaming the dog for biting you.
is it green, orange, and white? - a guess before i google.
bro, that's not funny. no man's sky is fucking terrible.
cmon, you don't ask a serious musician to perform "i ran"
"ear-on" is quickly becoming the preferred pronunciation here too; it's mostly just deep-southerners who pronounce it "i ran" these days.
and yet saudi arabia, the home country of 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers, as well as the mastermind of the attacks, has long been one of our closest buddies in the middle east. most of the things iran has been demonized for are at least as horrible in saudi arabia, if not far worse.
no. i think it's against the constitution to bar a u.s. citizen from entering the u.s. he now might not be able to get into iran though.
i think all the people who voted for trump just because they didn't want to vote for hillary are kicking themselves right now. the people who voted for trump because they actually wanted to, though... they're happy as clams, largely because they have absolutely no idea how things like trade agreements and international politics will affect them on a very real level.
are dual citizens affected? i was under the impression that because dual citizenship is not recognized by the us they could just use their us passport to enter (but i might be wrong).
it goes back way, way farther than any of that. this goes back to the fall of the ottoman empire and beyond. our presidents are mostly dealing with the fallout of much earlier decisions, it's unlikely there was ever going to be "good" outcomes no matter what course of action was taken.
residents or expatriates? those are two very different groups. i had an iranian-born neighbor who escaped the country one step ahead of the secret police, and hated the ayatollahs as much as any man living, which is to be expected.
more like ashamed of your fellow americans who voted in the current government.
iran once had democratically elected, secular government in the 1950s. but when that government wanted to nationalize the oil industry, which would hurt bp's profits, the cia staged a coup. the monarchy in iran then became a lot more monarchistic. the king of iran used secret police to wipe out political opponents.
the actual answer is that the "ir-" part rhymes with the start of irrigation. the "-ran" part rhymes with khan (the wrath of).
i live in california and its the only pronunciation i ever hear used in person. the "i ran" one, i mean.
i also prefer to say "ih-rock" but "i-rack" seems to be the popular pronunciation. the "i - " pronunciations just sound so americanized to me.
if he does have dual citizenship then he should use his iranian passport to get into iran and his u.s. passport to get back into the states. but really, he probably shouldn't leave/have left at all.
there's an exception. if a border patrol officer, or an airport security officer finds it necessary to detain you from entering the nation, they could legally do so. you'll have miranda rights, if you present your passport, and you'll have the right to an attorney.
i was told (before this, but it still holds true) to show my us passport when entering/leaving the us and my eu passport when entering/leaving the eu. they're not allowed to stamp you if you're a citizen, so both of mine are sadly blank while friends get cute stamps q_q when i messed up (like, a year or two after being told this from the us side) the guy in germany (point of entry that flight) flipped through my passport 3x, then asked if i was military. i then sheepishly told him i gave him the wrong passport and he gave me this "silly child" look and repeated that when in eu, i need to give him the eu passport.
i'm surprised that such a thing can be done so easily. just an executive order? it's because the republicans are holding the 3 houses right?
our passports say we are usa nationals but include our place of birth which is iran. which means we are iranian nationals since iran doesn't allow you to revoke citizenship. it's a damn loophole.
iran banned entry of any american citizens into the country. my dad has dual citizenship and has business in iran. i have no idea how this is going to effect him as i haven't read the eo yet, or the order banning american citizens from entering iran.
i am one of those people, and i readily admit it. it was my first election as well, and my parents are hardcore trump supporters- they're giddy about what is happening, and i find it difficult to hide my disgust. the events unfolding are absolutely horrendous, and if i could take back my vote and cast it again, i would. i'm sorry, america.
lol no, they hate the liberals. trump could nuke the world and they will say "well hilary would have done the same thing so there is no difference anyway." i'm not kidding, i had this argument.
no they voted for trump because their core belief is that america by definition is a white christian nation. all other talking points are just there to obfuscate that one truth.
orban and duda would like a word, they do not like lepen stealing their spotlight as first right-wing extremists in power. also, isis is using drumpf in their adverts now, as an example that peaceful coexistence isn't possible.
that's true. my parents visited damascus in the early 80s and they were blown away by how beautiful it was.
or was it the people who drew the borders in the first place?
this comment hit the nail on the head. i encourage everyone to learn about us-soviet proxy wars and imperialism in the middle east. almost every modern day conflict in the region can be attributed to them.
the only people i personally know are persians that have left the country and they hate the regime deeply. and wasn't there more and more reports that iranians youth are very critical of the religious rules and revolts against it on social media.
apparently trump has a grudge with those colors, i assume next we'll punish italy for no good reason.
it's ok. you are a victim of your surroundings. you aren't just dumb, you just missed the update in information. you are not a lost cause.
the problem i think is that iran doesn't recognize dual citizenship.
ianal, but as border control is part of the executive branch, trump can do this. congress can sign a bill overruling the president, but won't. the scotus can order an injunction.
iranians with us citizenship will be allowed back. but don't know if iran will let us citizens in. so ridiculous.
but trump literally said he would do all these things in his campaign...
if it makes you feel any better, it makes me hopeful that there are people like you who are renouncing their support of trump, and are admitting it. that's the only hope we have of stopping him, eroding his public support.
did you not listen to his campaign promises? because hes doing exactly what he said he would do.
you can fix part of it in 2018 when congress goes up for reelection.
so he is doing exactly what he said he would do and you regret voting for him? it's not like any of this is a secret, did you take any time to research anything before you voted?
as a guy in his 30's, i voted for bernie, then held my nose and voted for hillary. when you're older you try to be idealistic, but when that doesn't work out you settle for what's practical. young people tend to suck at that. i would guess the reason so many kids on reddit like trump is that he basically has permanent teen angst and that makes him easy to identify with. add to that the fact that he overtly hates women and minorities and he's about your average redditor. as much as the woman-hating, angsty racist might appeal to the younger set, at the end of the day he's still an idiot, he's profoundly anti-democratic, and completely unqualified. so. sure, hillary wasn't my first choice, but it was very clear what trump was before he was elected, and now a new wave of people are seeing what was in front of them all along. thanks for coming around in the end, but the ship sailed in november.
we forgive you. just remember this in four years. if everyone who voted trump that now regrets it shows up to the polls in 2020, we can get rid of this cheeto.
for them it's like a game of football, conservatives vs liberals. it's not about what's in the best interests of everyone, it's just about winning.
trump could literally fuck all of them in the ass and they'd still be like "lol take that liberals"
trump is absolutely the antithesis of what christianity claims to be. it boggles my mind.
"in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
it can go back farther than that too. the middle east is a prosperous land, and the land where civilisation was essentially born. war has raged there for essentially all of documented human history. it can genuinely be argued that we should be blaming the mess of the middle east on the assyrians or the babylonians.
i loved san andreas but vice city was just more fun and brighter, plus the 80s soundtrack was legit
i don't think it matters that it's not the brightest idea, the man's mother just died.
yeah without congress it would have to go to the supreme court as (at least in part) a violation of due process. trump's got the next nominee who will most definitely back trump's agenda in every shape and form. it would be up to the other conservative judges to see if they are willing to sell their soul to the devil.
it would have been better if they had realized before they voted.
i'm participating in every election i can, local, state, and nationwide.
this is what i keep wondering. how are people suddenly surprised?
you think the average redditor hates women and is racist? are you like exclusively subscribed to /r/theredpill and /r/imgoingtohellforthis ?? because racism and women hating tend to be called out on most normal/popular subs. i mean there's multiple subs dedicated to pointing out that kind of behavior and having a laugh at their ignorance.
surely he won't last that long....? (me being hopeful)
wonder what would happen if he was denounced by the pope. oh, wait...
get yourself down to o'shag hennessy's office right now!
i mean, he hasn't done anything he didn't campaign on. if you voted for him, you pretty much said, "i can stomach this." curious why /u/rjd20 is having such a change of heart now.
that's irrelevant now. trump is president and we can't change that until he's impeached. the more people who oppose trump now the likelier that will happen.
i don't think one of his campaign promises was "bash the media for providing legitimate facts" but we saw a lot of that after the inauguration. plus, when you're in a trump echo chamber, it's easy to miss the less desirable stuff you might disagree with. seems like that's what happened for op.
i browse a lot of video game subreddits, and it's basically karma suicide to try and point out that x or y thing may be bigoted or isn't diverse or whatever (even if it's a completely accurate criticism, which it often is). you pretty much just get shit on for being "too sensitive" or "not getting the joke" or some other typical bigoted conservative cop-out.
he is a 70 year old obese angry man that eats mostly fast food in one of the most stressful jobs on the planet, doubtful he makes it to 2020 even if congress lets him.
so many great 80s songs from that game, such as "keep on lovin' you" by reo speedwagon, "you've got another thing coming" by judas priest, "running with the night" by lionel richie, "out of touch" by hall and oates", and "she sells sanctuary" by the cult.
it was his first election. politics is a lot to get into, and it's a bit overwhelming when you're young. i've participated in many elections and this one sucked big balls.
is impeaching trump something that we want though? wouldn't that put pence in his seat? i can't help but think some house of cards shit is going on
i literally downloaded the entire v rock track list with commercials and everything and burned it to cd as a teenager to keep in my first car because it was that fucking awesome. lock up your daughters. shoot your sons ("dad....!"). cuz love fist is coming to town.
i mean no sarcasm when i say: good on you. few people would readily reassess their beliefs like that.
if we were to impeach trump for breaking his oath of office, we could also call for pence to resign as vp, though he's not obligated to agree to it. then the speaker of the house would get it, and paul ryan seems like a pretty level-headed guy to me, if perhaps lacking in integrity. having trump get impeached would probably scare pence enough to not act too far out of line.
pence is a career politician and seems more apt for the job and this jackass trump
the only thing that may be worse than a trump presidency is a pence presidency.
i once saw a lady park her car on the crossed off area inches from the handicapped van. i called her out on it as i was walking by and she rolled her eyes at me. on my way out of the store a half hour later her car was being towed :)
see it all the time. i always think, "thats not what those lines and areas are for" fuck bad parkers in general
this is why you need metal studs on your knees. you know, for your protection.
i'm heading into a pharmacy when i notice a pickup with 2 good looking young ladies pull into one of the handicap spots. i admit, my brain assumed the worst of them. but i didn't say anything, because the nonagenarian in the mesh ballcap and tweed coat was already yelling at them before their doors open. the driver gets out and walks around the back of the truck, obviously able bodied. the oldtimer is still raving. passenger hasn't moved, i'm beginning to understand what's happening, wishing i had some popcorn. driver reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a folding wheelchair. proto-fossil is still bitching. passenger door opens, driver helps passenger into the chair. passenger is double amputee above her knees. old guy's parting shot was "you're not the kind of people these spots are for!" neither girl said a word to the guy the whole time, i was in awe of their self control.
i work for the parking authority in my city. i'm gonna use this picture in an attempt to expand our capabilities when ticketing people who are parked in or even partially parked in a disabled spot. as it stands we can only issue them a warning if the vehicle is less than 50% in the disabled zone. i've always felt they should get the full ticket when they are even partially in the spot, and this picture helps my opinion. it's incredibly easy to avoid being in the disabled spot at all. if you don't correct yourself you deserve some form of punishment.
i know they've trialled apps where you can upload bad parking offences and get a cut of the fine. part of me hates the idea, but then another part thinks it's the best solution to something like this. i mean, who parks over a disabled area like that? someone not getting fined enough probably.
as a handicapped motorcycle rider nothing pisses me off more than asshats using the ramp area as a motorcycle spot.
park a little closer to them and fuck their shit up with your ramp.
it'd be a shame if your wheelchair scratched the shit out of every single body panel on the drivers side. but unfortunately sometimes there's just no way of avoiding that.
some dick parks like that making your day extra hard, (as if you didn't already deal with enough difficulties in a day), and you post a funny picture with a caption starting with "please.."???? you are such a better person than me it hurts. i'm sorry that person was an asshole.
shit. i have been guilty of this in the past to avoid door dings, and admittedly never even thought about it being space for a ramp. thank you for the enlightenment.
when i was in college i needed special parking because of the extreme distances to the parking lot. this is shortly before i got a handicapped placard. the handicapped parking was in the special parking area. one day i saw a bmw parked at an angle across three handicapped spaces. it sure was unfortunate when i parked my full size pick up in the adjacent space blocking it in. but the real tragedy was when i must have butt dialed campus security about it and the sent a flatbed to remove the bmw. since it was parked at such an angle they had to drag it sideways a good 15-20 feet. you could hear the tires scream across the entire campus. before you call me an asshole know that there were very few of those spots. i have lymphedema in both my legs and i would not have taken one. too many needed it that required wheel chair access.
thank you for pointing that out. i have been guilty of parking on the lines before and never thought of that. so i'm sorry and now i know to never do that.
way back in the day, i had a job which allowed me to write citations to people who parked in handicap access aisles or parked in designated space using someone else's permit. get this; people use their dead parents or grandparents handicap placards. myself and my coworkers wrote these citations with a vengeance. that level of selfishness just irks me. people who actually need the space can't use it because some lazy ass doesn't want to walk a bit. not a single person i cited had any sort of physical disability that justified their need to use someone else's placard. and i wrote hundreds of these. sometimes it was just a temporary and the person would use white out and a sharpie to extend the expiration date. favorite quote by someone i issued a cite to was, "that was an expensive sandwich". that's right. you go eat that sandwich and think about what you've done.
that's a poorly designed handicapped area. it should be a full spot, if not bigger. that appears to be a half spot. even if the car were parked within the lines, it'd still be difficult for you to get out.
not justifying the shitty park job, but that's not the ada van accessible space.
$20 says there are new jersey plates on that car.
that's not a van accessible crosshatch. ada standards are 8-foot crosshatch for van accessible parking.
haha, she definitely thinks you called the cops on her. i bet she still occasionally thinks back on your face and internally snarls with loathing.
when i worked in a big store we would have people park either a) in the stripes for a handicap vehicle or b) right in front of the store in the fire lane. we would page them once to move, but if they didn't we would call and have them towed. it was glorious.
dude a lot of people need to learn to drive i saw a guy cut off an ambulance, but they lost control of their car and ended up scraping the barrier at the exit
my office studio was just talking about this, and to my surprise, a coworker said he didn't think it was a big deal cause he's never seen someone need ramp space and "there can't be more than a single person in our state" that needs it. i was aghast and didn't exactly respond politely. i've had friends be affected by that same selfish attitude. people are airheads.
hey i used to live in a 'pickup truck/f-150s everywhere' city and these idiots purposely won't park right. one guy i went to school with decided to cut me off in traffic, almost causing me to crash, and then swerved in the parking lot (mall) and took a handicap spot. new shiny truck and he and his friends got out and laughed at me. i walked in with a smug ass grin though cause they were so busy laughing and causing a scene in the mall that nobody noticed his new shiny truck being towed. lesson: don't drive like a psycho and park in handicap spaces just because you have a new truck your dad bought you.
the guy taking the picture should have called the local pd. they'd have happily ticketed and maybe towed the idiot parked in the blue.
psa: don't drive a vehicle if you don't know how to park between the lines.
a screwdriver fastened to the wheelchair for "tightening up the screws when they get loose" - and punching holes in peoples car doors and tires.
relevant user name. as a motorcycle rider, i hate when other riders are dicks. parking in those hashs and lane splitting thru all lanes of traffic not just between 1-2 are the ones i hate most
oh, it's a love hate thing with my fellow riders. we're so quick to express outrage at "stupid cagers" but then we pull all kinds of shenanigans (such as utilizing handicap shit for parking). this one especially, any rider ought to be sensitive to. you know ... you put your bike in the center of a nice big parking spot, and both douchebags who pulled in to your left and right are over the line. curious about your riding story. there's a guy that sometimes posts on the /r/motorcycles sub who has a prosthetic arm and he does flat tracking. it's awesome!
i can't tell you how many times i have slammed my wheelchair into a illegally parked car
as a person who needs that space to transfer my wheelchair in and out of my car, i appreciate your candidness. i'm just genuinely curious: what did you think those striped spaces were for? maybe you never stopped to think about it, but i'm just curious if you thought something else.
no problem! yea i honestly don't think people do it on purpose. i also don't think they are aware of the room needed for the ramp.
those brightly painted lines might have been your first clue.
serious question, not hostility. i seek further understanding. i grew up with a parent in the medical profession, so i always had an understanding of what that space was for. did you assume it was for some other reason? understanding helps eliminate frustration and anger, which leads to better communication, and successful problem solving.
how could you possibly not know that? did you think they got extra space for no reason at all?
you say "the" as if of course every parking lot has one. but in the real world there almost never is. we wheelchair van drivers have to do the best we can to use whatever is available. even when there is one, it's usually full. it bugs me when my husband is trying to avoid being run over, because we had to take a regular end-of-the-row spot, and we see someone come out whose only need for the crip spot is their big suv full of healthy kids. they may have an invisible disability, but they could use the smaller spot.
if he/she did call the cops on her or tow truck company then good. people should have a little decency.
do cops even react fast enough for these things? if they do then i'm definitely calling cops next time i see this.
what i like most about getting an entitled jack ass towed is that unlike useless things like tickets, towing is a great leveller. doesn't matter how well off you are, now you're calling a cab and going to fetch your car. good bye afternoon plans.
she deserved being towed just for parking like a dick.
"lol we'll come back for you" - ambulance dudes, probably
even better make it look like you fell out of the wheelchair with the kid in your lap while trying to navigate out of the ramp.
"it's ok, we missed grandma's funeral but maybe we'll make it to grandpa's funeral in a few years"
eh just roll down it backwards and put a nice scratch on the car
just a quick reminder that not all disabilities are visible; i know someone who you wouldn't know had a disability because she isn't in a wheel chair or anything, but she gets horrible pain in her legs and back if she has to walk too far. she gets called out all of the time and has to constantly explain why she is allowed to have that spot. i try to give people the benefit of the doubt when i can.
i park way the fuck out in narnia because apparently not bashing one's door off adjacent cars when opening it is a difficult concept where i live
i started doing this as well and i actually save a lot of time. i get frustrated now when my friends are driving and will spend extra minutes to find a "good" spot.
i remember when i was younger, this new corvette was parked fucking horribly in a handicap spot (no handicapped plates obviously). they must of threw their door open because it caused a major dent in my dad's car door and actually had paint from our vehicle on it. i've never seen a person do so many laps around a car just keying the paint off in rage.
lol, nope. they'll happily tell you they don't get involved in private lot disputes.
same goes for driving. please stay in the dashed lines too. if you need to change lanes then please don't wait to turn on your signal after you decided to cut me off.
man...if i could join parking enforcement for a week...city budget would be doubled.
only problem is that the app may encourage false stories or people using the app while driving in the pursuit of money.
the thing is tho that you will have to be able to prove it wasn't faked (like shopped or set up) or what ever. a picture by a random person isn't what i would call solid proof. a better idea would be to have a phone number you can call an report it too so an officer or parking attendant can come and confirm the offense and write the ticket.
last summer as i was stuck in gridlocked rush hour traffic, i saw a motorcyclist pull off the road, on to the sidewalk, and just fuck off down there until he snuck back in between cars. he did this three times. i've never hated anyone more in a moment than that dude. edited because people think this is totally cool. it's illegal to ride a motorcycle on a residential sidewalk. this particular sidewalk is also fairly busy, and the motorcyclist was swerving around kids waiting at a bus stop/walking down the sidewalk.
i am a right leg below knee amputee. no special set up need. i have handicapped plates on the bike. i love the looks i get when parking the bike in a handicapped spot. wife and i went to get breakfast in an affluent part of town on the bike. i proceeded to park in a handicapped spot and some jerkwad tried to yell at me about it. he couldn't see the plate from where he was sitting. told him to get off his ass and look at the plate. he started to back down and explained that he made legs for people that have lost them. i rolled up the jeans leg and asked him "you mean like this"? he started to really back track. got to talking to him and someone he was sitting with said his name and said wouldn't it be funny if you made one of his legs. raised my sunglasses and said he had made them for me when i was younger. "holy shit how's your mom and your brother."
+1 i am curious too. i was in a motorcycle accident that left me with a paralyzed right leg and a half-paralyzed left arm with lots of broken bones and replaced joints. i was thinking of maybe riding again one day, but i cant pull a clutch in my left arm or use the rear brake with my right foot.
just don't hit a pebble or you'll be eating pavement
he was just trying to get out of his car and his wheelchair accidentally scratched the side in the shape of a dick.
not op but i also didn't know how wheelchair ramps worked until today. i assumed the painted lines were extra room to maneuver for "just in case" scenarios e.g. someone on a gurney. i've just never actually seen someone use a handicapped spot with a wheelchair, only older people (who look like they could use the extra room to get the door open and get out.)
you're being a lot nicer than i am. i'm just sitting here thinking the guy is a fucking moron.
i think most people will not do it on purpose but i've known people who have bought a new car and will intentionally do this to avoid getting a scratch or a dent. if you're that concerned, park in the back of the lot and walk the extra 2 minutes.
it's my job to know that stuff, i'm an architect. the "van accessible" space has a full size (8'-0") space crossed out next to it. versus the 5'-0" space of the "standard" accessible space. i for get the ratio of van to standard spaces ratio requirements, so not every location may not require both.
exactly. it would be completely warranted. she not only obstructed a handicapped space, she did it while a handicapped person's vehicle was *already parked there*. good for anyone that gets the tow truck in route so that person doesn't have to wait around in order to simply carry on with their day.
if i was in that situation, and i had time to spare, i'd definitely call the tow truck/cops, whatever it is. parking police
extremely well off people will be calling their house staff and asking them to drive over one of the other cars. after the new car is delivered, that staff member will now take a cab and pick up the towed car. afternoon plans: slightly inconvenienced.
i always hack up a big loogie into my hand and wipe it under the driver side door handle when i see people park like this.
might be easier to just call a tow truck. requires fewer acting classes.
asphyxiate the child and make it look like you fell on it while trying to exit the vehicle and you couldn't get up again and smothered it under you. all because this asshole couldn't park right. that will show him.
i do the same. i could be the only car in the back row and somebody will still park right next to me though.
i find parking is also a whole lot easier when you just go straight to the back and don't get snarled up in a mess of idiots fighting for spots right up front. i.e. parking garages: loop straight up to the highest empty floor and you can often get a spot easily and nearer the stairs and avoid the shitshow below.
"you see what happens larry? this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass!"
i'm ok with that. getting a driving license is too easy in america.
what's this signal you mention? are you trying to say i can let other drivers know when i need to change where i am on the road? incredible! why doesn't every car have this /s
there was a parking enforcement reality show called "parking wars." it only lasted a couple seasons but was oddly satisfying.
the other day i watched a guy on a scooter pull up to a red stop light, get off, push his scooter through the intersection via the cross walk, then get back on and continue on down the road.
i mean, if anything it's kind of a good thing that he had your back. he was more concerned about somebody taking up a handicapped spot. dude obviously cares about his profession.
"what's it gonna do, paralyse me?" *- paralysed man*
people always forget the bit that comes after that.
perhaps it depends on the type of disability? for example, someone that is pretty heavily paralyzed may need the space for the ramp, wheelchair, assistance, etc.
it's not even 2 minutes, for most lots it's around 30 seconds or so. it's crazy what people will do to get a closer spot: the amount of times they'll loop around, or the time they will waste squatting in an aisle until a spot frees up. just drive towards the back & take a spot further away: use less gas, waste less time, have more space getting in and out of your vehicle, and burn six or seven extra calories walking more.
this was never explained in any class or social situation i have ever been in. i don't think everyone who looks at that extra space knows it's for a wheelchair ramp. i'm sure it's an honest mistake people make sometimes, it's not because they're stupid.
civil engineer here. this is true. it also doesnt look like these are truly legal ada stalls. from the looks of it there is a 6" exposure curb with no ramp up to the sidewalk.
no, van spaces are only required when the lot goes over 100 parking stalls. 0-100 stalls is 2 standard handicapped spaces, then it jumps to 2+1 van, and rises from there.
it literally takes be 2 minutes. and you can do it while walking. source: i've had a lot of people towed/ticketed
ultra well off people can pop on their iron man suit or radio in their batmobile. afternoon plans: still awesome.
but won't fuck them up psychologically, which is what we're really about here
make sure a "happy birthday mom" cake fell on the pavement too.
just shave his head and tell him/her they have cancer. they'll believe you and just say shit they'd normally say if they had cancer because they believe it 100%
that show was great until it left philadelphia and turned into another one of those towing shows like lizard lick towing or one of those repo shows.
is that guy really that bad? i mean he had decency enough to actually push the scooter, instead of riding it like the moron in the op comment. i mean, pushing a scooter isn't that different from pushing a bicycle around.
i love it. depending on the style leg it may be held on by suction. he may hit the pressure release button and let the rest of the prank go on. i was with a group of kids when i was younger and they were trying to claim who was the toughest. my dad got tired of listening to them go on and on. walked over with a staple gun and put three right in my leg through my jeans. they had no idea about the leg. needless to say i won the toughest kid competition that day.
part of not being stupid is being able to infer things without having them explained to you.
can we just go back to the gunshot to the head next to the mass grave?
instead of using horses, use people in wheelchairs.
something can be legal *and* asshole behavior. like purposefully cutting off someone trying to merge.
technically true, but the person merging has a limited runway to manage the merge. it's normal etiquette to let them in, if you don't you're a dick who's wrecking the flow of traffic.
people who park like assholes can be summed up in three sentences: they don't know. they don't care. they don't care to know. i honestly don't think that psychologically fucking with these people will have any effect.
sob, "he just beat cancer! oh god, whyyyyyyyyyyy??"
*10 minutes later wife arrives at car* "why is the babies head shaved?"
how? if the traffic light is red in your current direction, it means that the light on the cross street is almost certainly green, so it's illegal to cross the crosswalk.
i know that sounds funny and all, but you need to think about the practicality. sure, if there's some nasty dog crap lying nearby, and you can grab some with a stick and put it on their door handle, then great! but that's not likely to happen, and you don't really want to carry around smelly poop just for occasional problems like this, plus it dries up pretty quickly. that's why i recommended automotive grease: it never dries up, it doesn't smell too bad, and it's a real pain to get off your fingers too.
not as fun. if you want something like that go vlad the impaler style. have them dig a grave and then push them in and have someone else cover it back up.
no, it's proper etiquette that when you are merging you don't wait till the last second and try to shove your way in! just like when coming on the highway, speed the fuck up to the flow of traffic before trying to merge on.
correct and most times someone has been a dick to me and not let me me out, i have ended up right behind them at the next junction so made no difference
a nice big fine or car at the impound that will help.
chances are that if the lot owner doesn't call tow trucks for parking enforcement you have a good chance of impersonating them. "yes, tow and stow? i'm bobo bojangles, owner of shit shops property. we gotta shit show. wanna make some dough?"
well stab some tires clearly nobody is watching or cares
and that's when you know that the system has failed and keying their car is the only logical answer.
is the lot owner legally required to provide handicap parking?
i worked at a supermarket and had to deal with people parked in the disabled bays. there was a guy who parked in one, got out and walked about 10 yards, saw me, and started limping. then limped on the other leg whilst smirking at me and joking about it to his mate on the way into the store for good measure. i went inside to get one of our "don't be a douchebag and park in a disabled spot when not disabled*" which was paper based and was a pain to remove at the best of times, but it was raining. the paper soaked through and, mixed with the adhesive, it became like a gooier, stickier wallpaper paste. the guy was there for ages trying to peel it off while giving me evil looks.
some say you can become a wizard on top of smith rock.
props to a freaking buddy like that to get up and go with you, you don't get too many friends like that!
i think sometimes you have to go have a crazy adventure to reboot things and figure yourself out a bit. looks like an amazing trip, hope life continues to offer you such beauty and contentment.
when i see stuff like this i'm always reminded of the john lennon lyric "life is what happens while you're busy making other plans". everybody should do a trip like this once in a lifetime.
amazing!!! in all how long did it take to ride all the way to alaska? this kind of journey is something i've been craving all my life.
no way!! we met your buddy on his way back at liard hot springs!! haha we hung out and it was freezing so he came and slept on the floor in our hotel room. we bought him breakfast the next day and parted ways lol
you're the man! as a brit, we can travel from the southern tip to northern tip in about 10 hours. i'd love to experience the vastness of north america one day.
this could be made into one of the best movies of all times.
my father was a major contractor on the alcan (alaska) highway, and filled an album with photos. you think it's desolate and dangerous now? but your photos are beautiful, and that was a magnificent thing to do! you will have that for the rest of your life.
vancouver keeping its reputation. thanks for highlighting us. :) looks like you had a great journey!
great adventure. though i don't think the bike rave was illegal.
these pictures are beautiful, i hope life gets better for you! congrats on the awesome trip, what camera/lens did you use?
oh man, i just went through a terrible breakup. i quit my job as a professor and i'm going to fucking portland to play guitar in coffee shops, 'cause that's what i fucking feel like doing now. then maybe i'll go to fucking california. hopefully i'll meet a lot of people on the way, and maybe fuck some of them. i recently sucked a man's cock in a golf course at 3am, just for the fuck of it, but i'm definitely not gay. all about the boobs.
cool that you took hwy 97 instead of i5 to see central oregon. i live just a few miles from where you took picture 7.
one of the best picture albums i've seen on reddit. what was the closest call you guys had?
thanks for posting these. they are truly awesome photos.
i was waiting to see a comment like this, it's a great friend that would drop everything and go on a trip like that. seems like a stand up guy. thank's op, for doing what i have wanted to do for the last few years, because although i'll never do it, i can enjoy your trip vicariously.
thank you! it has really allowed me to kind of 'find myself' after such a turbulent time and i'm now doing plenty of job-seeking with renewed inspiration to spend my time saving up for more experiences like this.
so it took you 6 weeks for the round trip? approximately how much did you have to save up for it?
but seriously, what was he doing? why? is this a thing? is he ok? what? why? someone knows something, tell me.
we took our sweet time up there, so we got there in about a month. you can do it in two weeks or less.
this album reminds me of that walter mitty movie. just makes me want to go out and travel
you are working so that you can save up enough money to do this one day. i am studying so that i can get and be good at my job so that i one day can and will do this.
its a fun drive. do it in the summer. pay the 50 bucks and throw yourself in the arctic ocean. the tour guide made 40k per year he told us. all he did was drive a tour bus. this place is a goldmine if you're made tough as nails
i believe his camera is the leica m typ 240, which retails for about $7,000 (without lenses). i would assume they're both either pro photographers or it's a big hobby :)
you guys were awesome! i was so pissed at myself for not getting your photo. thanks again for the awesome hospitality and i hope you found that watch.
for me, 73 days. i took some downtime to fix the bike and took my time on the way up and down.
the cops that kicked us out of stanley park after we extracted one of our newly made drunk friends out of a tree near the seawall told us it was, but maybe that was the last stop only?
some incredibly rash and somewhat self destructive choices. we're behind you all the way.
the last time i was between jobs i just masturbated and watched macgyver reruns. props to you, man.
73 days total, so closer to 10 weeks. i spent almost two weeks fixing up my bike after the run up to the arctic as well as recouping a bit (we went back to skagway). i'm in the process of doing the math of what the exact cost breakdown was...
when my friend and i did it in a car in june, it was about $2500 each. we just graduated college though, so we were pretty poor. we did it in just 26 days (from illinois), and didn't spend much on anything extra. no helicopter tours or ferry rides because we couldn't afford it.
so if i may ask, how far did you drive to get to alaska? and how did your altima hold up?
jasper local here. quick correction. jasper national parks is located in alberta, not british columbia. thanks for checking out my hometown!
thanks so much for the nice words! i actually miss alaska even more than the road. it's just such a remarkable place. people live in touch with nature in a way i have never seen, and the sheer scale of everything is awe inspiring. also the bar was open until 5 am. i'll x-post it to the subreddit! and yeah, i am a full dutchman and ik kan zeker nog nederlands praten! ik kwam zelfs een poffertjeskraam tegen in de yukon! o_o
bears have an innate sense not to fuck with some dude walking all the way to the arctic circle.
among some circles, yes. i was tour cycling in tajikistan when i met someone on the way walking from london to beijing. he left with two dogs, one died in turkey, buried it roadside. he still had one, didn't have a chinese visa, in fact, he planned on sneaking into the country the next day. crazy. i met another guy, sailing around the world, massive storm, loses his boat. picked up by a freighter, takes it to italy, decieded to start walking home, first to east asia, then get a boat to alaska, then south to wherever he lived in the states.
money is the only thing keeping me from leaving tomorrow.
unless you have anyone who depends on you, or a job that would be difficult to get back.
the only problem with this is that for many people, by the time they can afford to do it, they can't fully enjoy it. traveling the world is probably way more fun and efficient at 25 than at 65.
ha yeah, not many directions to follow once you get into tok. take a right and keep going straight.
what does your buddy do that he was able to take this awesome trip?
i rarely have the attention span to make it through an album this large - 71 pictures later, i'm looking through it again. awesome stuff - thanks for sharing.
no worries, i can only imagine it beat sleeping in your tent that night haha. reddits pretty cool, never thought i'd talk to you ever again lol
you went out of your way to crater lake. but i love crater lake so i understand.
thanks! i mean, i'm 24 years old, and i'll probably never get a job in academia again because i'm leaving four weeks into the semester, but this girl **broke** my heart, man. so fuck her. i'm going to go enjoy my life instead of sitting around weeping and feeling sick and anxious.
correct, i used an m with a 12mm voigtlander, a 21mm zeiss and 35mm leica lens :)
ah thanks, means a lot to me that it can inspire and uplift others! we did just sleep in tents, yup. it got cold, but we packed up warm and the long light helped it get less cold.
you're right, i keep forgetting since it looks more like bc and less like alberta, which is pretty flat.
it's weird how my broken afrikaans somehow allowed me to understand part of what you were saying!
i noticed the dutch flag on your arms :d did you emigrate to the states or just bought a bike there?
now *i* wanna lose my job and wife! i have goals now!
how about we split the gas costs, i ride and you sit on the back lurking reddit?
that's why you save up. no kids. no marriage. no frivolous spending unless it's something you truly want long term. or idk. i'm 20 and i know nothing at this point.
if you want to make a book, that's about enough to start a run for our backers and family and friends. i'm not rich by any means, and in fact, i'm pretty broke now that i am back. i sold all my previous gear to buy my leica m. it was worth it. it's a great camera.
haha, fun story: i left my wallet in chicken, and had to ride that whole highway back and then up to tok again. since it was so straight, i was blasting 120+ down the straight section up to tok and then blew by a state trooper in a 50 zone... he didn't move, thank god...
woke up to find that the op of an incredible album of photos replied to my comment. color me honored. really enjoyed looking through the pictures of your trip, man. (props for having sex with sarah)
me too! i think it was the nice captions for every pic that let you know exactly what was going on.
seriously though, is there any way to go on adventures like this *without* worrying about losing your job? i'd love to just disappear for months, but how would i pay for rent, gas, etc and have a job and home when i get back?
i think they're purposefully avoiding answering the question because they would rather the quality of the photos be attributed to their obviously very high skill level and not the $6,950 tool they used. the leica will give you this level of quality if you know completely what you're doing, but no one is just going to pick up a manual focus only camera like that and get these kinds of results.
it's a $6,000+ leica m and the lens is at least $10,000. they ride ducatis and live in san fransisco and though the guy lost his job they were able to afford the time and money to take a trip to alaska.. aka they are fucking rich.
makes me want to get married on a motorcycle and then get divorced
yeah, that's a hell of a kit. the job you lost, was it as a photographer of some kind?
yes! and the hoarse-voiced lady told me that a pack of drum was 24 bucks up there :)
i didn't even have a wife or a job in the first place! seems like i'm already halfway there!
i know a guy who can take care of one of those for $10,000.
upvote for your name cause i love that eek a mouse song
how much does one of these bikes cost and what kind of gas mileage do they get? i realllyyyyyy want to do something like this at one point.
me three. this is the first large album i've made it through.
camera-quality aside, there's some great composition, here. i can't imagine there wasn't post-processing touch-up, too. saying the camera doesn't negate their skill. it's just i know my low-end dslr can't hit those colors... would love to know what it is.
my friend rides a klr650, i ride a used (20,000+ miles) gt1000. hardly the most expensive bikes in the world. i sold off all my photographic gear to buy an m. i saved up for a long time to go on this trip. we are by no means rich. though, the ride made us rich as far as experiences go.
makes me want to marry a motorcycle, divorce it, then marry something more practical like a compact sedan.
still considering doing the short film in the future? how about another chance to get your book?
in that case, don't check out /r/dualsport, /r/motorcycles, or /r/bobbers
ha! that'd pay for the bugatti and then maybe an hour or so of driving
congratulations you have been randomly selected to answer a few questions. please come with us /u/highsorcerer
my buddy's klr650 did 60 mpg with more economical gearing and shouldn't be more than $2-3k with a non-salvage title!
because the north is so sparsely populated, (yukon alone has 32,000 people in total for ex.) and the towns tend to be hundred of miles apart, the cops tend to ignore it if you speed on the highway. (within reason, some will stop you, just hasn't happened to me yet when doing 30 over the limit. i have actually been passed by the cops going faster the me on 2 separate occasions)
it seems like they've used alienskin exposure/topaz labs along with knoll light factory for the editing.
who knows! i hope this post gets some attention so we can see if anyone still wants a book.
that is surprisingly reasonable for a one in a life time trip.
man... fuck... this post makes me miss my bike... fuck
wow, that's a lot cheaper than i expected. guess its time to start planning the route!
* do i need a special license? like, b-class or something? * aren't ducati bikes like...nice? how are triumph bonnevilles?
i want to drive my car up there and drive as fast as it will go
i would certainly purchase the book if you guys have extra copies that you are selling.
i went halfway in a truck and it cost about 800 for gas and food. between three people it wasn't too bad. next time i'll have to cross the second border.
it's the $10k for the bike and replacement parts and the knowledge of how to fix anything on the bike while on the side of the road that is probably the deal killer.
he drove through canada too so add another $100-200. $1.40 per litre, about $5.15 per gallon... bummer eh?
'tis better to have rode and lost than to have never ridden at all.
why don't you have it anymore? if you don't mind my asking.
all of us that upvote deserve a couple drops of that frosty
you know if you just say "i have a keytag for a free frosty with my order" they will just give you one. they don't even ask to look at the keytag.
51,000 votes, probably 100,000 views. wendy's twitter worker gets shit done.
if this comment gets 10,000 upvotes can i get a free frosty too?
what the fuck is with all the wendy's bullshit lately? don't tell me that there isn't some marketing behind this.
seize the means of frosty production i mean me too thanks.
unfortunately, the math might not add up. a small wendy's frosty is 355ml (12 ounces). there are 20 drops per ml. that means there's a total of 7100 drops. if it takes 10,000 upvotes, and 10,000 people, to generate one free small frosty it wouldn't have enough drops for everyone to get even a single drop. now, if they go for a free large, that'd cover around 11,820 upvoters, if we're going with the same drop per upvote.
my father in law recommended the bamboozle movie last night over dinner.
i do that at sonic, i order a cheeseburger combo and say i have a coupon for a buy one get one free burger. i mean, i actually do have one but they never ask for it so... every day is half price burger day for bart
i used to work there. can confirm. that's because it costs one fucking dollar for a keytag and you get unlimited free frosties. also they're like baby sized so it doesn't honestly matter.
funnier report than most of the shit that gets upvoted here
i don't support this position but i'd gladly die for their right to express it
eli5 what even is a user report? i have never seen that and i have been redditing for about a year.
you're *vastly* underestimating the amount of non-voters/lurkers that will see this. very few people actually vote compared to how many will look at the post.
i will send you the money to buy a frosty if your comment reaches 10,000
people will pretty much upvote anything, even absolute garbage. "oh look, huge company responded to my mildly funny tweet." "to the top, boys!!!!"
i just want one fry dipped in the frosty and i'm good.
a lie, faker, or failure to deliver on a promise.
they sell them for like 1.99 and you get a free mini frosty everytime you go there. but yeah they don't ask to see it.
tbh, they're doing something interesting and it's okay to recognize and post that on social media. i mean, me too, thanks.
wait a second, are you telling me that the wendy's twitter account is being used to promote wendy's?!
no. but their twitter game has been amazing. roasted the shit out of that one guy the other day.
all too well. i spent so much time on that shit. remember racegod?
you pay $2 and get a tag that's good for free frosties, but you get 1 free frosty with a purchase... so you have to make a purchase to get it each time, if that makes sense.
it used to be a dollar in 2015 over by me. i didn't see how much it was in 2016 but for me, 17 was $2
i bet we could all just walk into a wendy's and claim we're the op, and wendy's would be all "oh yeah, totally, here's your free frosty". i don't see any downsides to this tbh
how many drops do you think that is boyo??? i mean me too thanks
omg me too thanks. everyone who sees me do this is like 'wut?' but it's so good. i dip my junior bacon cheeseburgers in frosty too
shit man i've bought one the last two years and when i was there the other day i saw the promotion on the screen. i said i wanted one and she said "oh we're not doing that anymore"...
they are transparent with their marketting. its the "oh look xyz brand cookie is amazing" and it's just a picture that annoy me. i still wont go to wendy's because i dont eat processed foods, but the wendy's pepe was hilarious.
hey some people aren't going to show up and claim their drop. i'll take theirs. me two (drops) thanks
don't little pieces of the burger get in it though?
reminds me of last night. a guy comes in for propane and says our store is the 4th one he's been to. the other 4 stores made excuses saying "our propane guy isn't here right now". my favorite was " its illegal to pump propane in the rain". it was 40 degrees and raining but my co worker just put on a jacket and pumped propane. i have heard some lazy ass excuses before but nobody wanted to give the poor guy propane because light rain in cool weather.
yeah i don't believe the lie that the burgers are never frozen, what do they do deliver it raw on a hot truck?
what is your definition of processed? because everything goes through processes
it's a primitive form of entertainment called the "joke"
things in boxes meant to stay on a shelf for 6-10 months loaded with sugar. i east mostly eggs, cuts of meat, leafy vegetables. yes the oils i cook with, seasonings i use etc etc etc process. its just a catch all phrase for basically the majority of what kraft, kellogs, general mills make.
that guy tweeted himself eating wendy's a few days later.
curious as to what you believe happens to food that's "processed" that you don't want to eat it. i'm an engineer who is responsible for making sure food gets from factories to store shelves safely, so i take offense to the automatic assumption that the food is unfit for consumption. i think that it's silly when people will, for example, happily hand-make preserves or jam or something similar and be happy with it sitting in their pantry for 6 months, but refuse to eat jam made with the same methods in a factory (though on a larger scale) because "ew, this can sit on a store shelf for _6 months_???". food preservation almost always just keeping it sterile from production to consumption, and keeping it away from things that will degrade it like sunlight or oxygen. you can do the exact same preservation in your home by boiling and sealing a jar, yet people are grossed out by the idea when they see it on a shelf.
this sounds sarcastic but i was actually interested
the ones that add ingredients im too stupid to know how to pronounce.
i don't think people that dislike "processed foods" give a shit about eating jam or preserves from a grocery store. i hear complaints about processed foods in regards to stuff like hamburgers, chicken fingers, and "pink slime" meme
nah they do that every year, for the whole year. it's a really tiny frosty but i eat wendys all the time.
like dihydrogen monoxide and glucopyranose?? i'm very confused sorry
i think he's talking about the keychain is available in december. when i picked mine up, i got mine the last week of december and was told it was the very last one.
it's 3 am. i'm tired, a bit sad and i find myself sympathizing with sauce. reddit works in mysterious ways.
that sauce is so radioactive by this point, you would get international sanctions if you tried to sell it to kim jong un
you know you're poor when you have a kitchen drawer specifically for these along with ketchup and soy sauce packets.
hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.
i kinda feel like taco bell just pulled a long con on this one. like they snuck this into this guy's house 5 years ago, assuming that some day he would replace the microwave and find this. actually, that would be a poor risk-reward ratio... they probably did this to hundreds of people over the past few years, just waiting for this moment. fucking taco bell.
the love story of a hot sauce packet dropped behind a microwave is captivating the attention of thousands of people from various countries around the globe. reddit truly *does* work in mysterious ways.
just in case you or anyone else thinks this is serious, microwave ovens have no connection whatsoever to radioactivity.
pfft just because i have a drawer full of these sauces and all my tupperware is margarine bowls doesn't meant i'm poor white trash! (i am though...)
it has nothing to do with money imo. it's just wasteful not to use those packets. you wouldn't throw away an unopened package of chicken, why would you throw away an unopened packet of ketchup? it's just food waste at that point. what drives me even crazier is when people get six or seven napkins at a fast food place, use three, and throw the unused ones directly into the garbage along with everything else. how could you be so wasteful?
i think so, but instead of crawling through a river of shit, if you do this, a river of shit will crawl out of you.
not only do they have to replace their microwave to see it, but they have to then post it to the interwebz. but perhaps tb researched their "victims" before breaking into their house and planting the sauce.
if you zoom in close, you can see dust and such on the packet. not to say it's not possible he dropped this back there right before, in hopes it would pick up dust to make it appear authentic, but seems like a lot of work. i'm just going to take it at face value and believe it happened.
if it was staged, would he have really chosen mild? knowing that we'd laugh at his choice of weak ass bitch sauce? that'd we'd judge his boring palette, most likely backed up by a boring personality that his peers merely tolerate? that we'd picture him eating his flavorless tacos, alone, surrounded by his flavorless furnishings, at the end of a flavorless day, another tick in a flavorless life? no. i don't think this was staged at all. i think it's sadly all too real.
ads don't get more obvious than this... /r/hailcorporate!
not sure why i always see idiots saying taco bell gives you the shits.. i eat taco bell on average 3 to 5 times a week and never have an issue. i think this is just some reddit upvote karma whore bullshit if you ask me
hello from england. it's 4am now and i can't sleep because i'm staying in a single bed with my so, and she somehow takes up most of the bed, even though i'm a foot taller than her.
"if a man does not have the sauce, then he is lost. but the same man can be lost in the sauce." -gucci mane
/r/ketchuphate would like to have a word with you.
i hear that donald trump wants to modernize our nuclear arsenal
don't sell it! give it a place of honor to watch the kitchen remodel, then cut it open and sacrifice it to the remodel gods in exchange for a blessing for your new kitchen!
actually microwave ovens do emit radiation, but it's a very small amount and it's non-ionizing so it doesn't cause cancer. the electromagnetic radiation given off by microwaves in use is known to interfere with wifi signals, for example.
can confirm., i am quite well off but i have no other way to get chick-fil-a sauce
i feel bad throwing my butter tubs in the recycle bin, but mostly i'm just far too lazy to clean and reuse them. now those containers that soup comes in from my favorite chinese restaurant in town? those babies last for *years* with repeated use.
not if you believe that expiration dates are hoaxes created by manufacturers to increase their sales. *puts on tinfoil hat*
man you can find someone from every walk of life on reddit
you can actually see the copyright date on the package in the picture. the "c" in a circle next to the 2012 on the last line.
random job you never think about #74: printing the taco bell sauce packaging
first of all it's been a cliche joke long before most of us discovered reddit. second as others are pointing out if your body isn't accustomed to the unnatural levels of sodium and fat that you get with fast food your body is going to try to reject it. finally, if you live in a city with a poorly funded food sanitation department then some fast food chains have a tendency to let their locations get fucking filthy. the wendy's in my neighborhood has fruitflies surrounding the trashcan at all times and every table is sticky 24/7.
for people that eat healthy, greasy fast food can get you pretty sick. not saying i'm healthy, i'm eating dominoes right now... but i remember after i stopped following my nutritionist, and had some mcdonalds i was on the can all night
i'm glad your dad ended up finding your mom behind the microwave.
hi from brazil, every woman will take most of the bed and you will be left almost falling , its a universal law
can confirm. my so is much smaller than me yet takes up the most space in bed
there's a taco bell nuclear asshole joke in there somewhere but i'm not clever enough.
can confirm. have asperger's syndrome, family owns microwave. coincidence?
you can test your microwave's shielding by putting your phone in it (don't turn the microwave on). your phone shoul not be able to get any wireless signal while in the microwave.
radiation is not the same as radioactivity, a microwave can emit microwave radiation but it's not gonna make something radioactive
i had this argument with my dad the other day, he thought i was crazy when i told the wifi sometimes goes out briefly cause someone was using a microwave. i didnt know enough to say i was100% right, but i had observed it happening.
you can buy the large one that goes in the middle of a nugget tray, just ask for it. it's like $7.
i introduced my boyfriend to chick-fil-a sauce this past weekend. he'd been using honey mustard this whole time. he's now converted.
further confirmation. built myself a 7000 sq ft house a year ago, made sure to design the kitchen with one extra drawer just for all the fast food sauces.
question: how does one get industrial quantities of mcdonalds (or even burger king) sweet-and-sour? follow-up: why the fuck does no place that serves chicken tenders (not nuggets) ever stock sweet and sour sauce? fuck your honey mustard, i want that shit they serve at mcdonalds!!
i used to make fun of my parents and grandparents for doing that. now that i'm a parent myself, i feel so bad about it. i started using paper shopping bags that we get from random expensive outlet stores (that we never even shopped at to begin with. how we have those bags i'll never know) as tote bags. at the korean market they have these really neat looking disposable bowls that i've been reusing for a year now. i keep present bags and used wrapping paper so that we can use it for someone else. i'm slowly but surely getting there.
and label them with a chalk label and a chalk marker! and tie a piece of twine on it!
conspiracies are just a conspiracy by tinfoil manufacturers to increase sales.
exactly my thoughts. i see this on reddit all the time. you just mention a specific person or profession and they pop up in a thread. it's either a big setup game that we are all a part of or reddit is just a magical place.
betcha can't find a midget tap dancer, that got tired of trying to make it big in hollywood, and ended up smuggling ecstasy. only to realize after his first delivery and seeing some strung out raver kid, he ended up giving that life up and now sells cutlery at costco.
that doesn't mean much. i have a stash of condiment packets in my desk at work and some of the ketchup had separated. i decided to check the copyright date and they were from 2012. i then looked at the date on the packets i'd just recieved from burger king and yup...2012.
i'm sure nobody cares, but you can ama if you want.
i eat pretty healthy most of the time (down 60 pounds) and hadn't had taco bell, or any particularly greasy anything, in at least two months. i had it this past tuesday. a lot of it. i felt absolutely fine. nothing different than if i had eaten a regular meal.
not stuck in the sink? these porn plots are getting out of hand.
hello from australia.. it's heaps fucking hot right now
hello america! we're visiting some friends so we're in the guest room, i'm desperately missing the double bed we have back home while she's passed out next to me oblivious!
it's somehow hilarious and awesome to me how some things never change no matter where on the planet you were born. we hairless apes are all just the same! smiles from the u.s. :)
or do turn it on, it's the fastest way to charge your phone!
what sorcery is this? i will ask next time i go there
i literally use them all depending on mood. when they changed their bbq to smokehouse bbq i sent them an email and they responded telling me that they would change it back.
same i just finished up with my 36,000 sq ft house and devoted an entire kitchen for the sauce packets.
next time you go to mcd's ask to speak with the manager and ask him/her if you can buy a box of the sweet n sour sauce tubs. depending on what kinda manager he or she is they may say yes or no. officially you're not supposed to sell the boxes but some managers sell all sorts of mcd's shit out the back door. they simply write it off as a loss for one reason or another and keep the money for themselves.
i started using reusable shopping bags like 10-12 years ago, and haven't bought a bag in many years. they seem to just keep multiplying in my giant bag of bags in the laundry room. i kept the plastic shopping bags to use as trash can bags around the house, and have yet to get to the bottom of those plastic bags. present bags are a score, but wrapping paper isn't worth keeping. i just buy it at 90% off the week after xmas if i'm running low, and prefer the recycled paper ones. but that's nothing compared to the giant tupperware bin of school supplies in the garage that i stock up on after they all go on sale at the end of the year. folders, ticonderoga pencils, dry erase markers, crayons, markers, pink erasers, all in gallon or 2 gallon ziploc bags. i spend less than $20 a year on school supplies at 75% or more off and rarely have to actually go out and buy a lot of new stuff at the beginning of the school year.
my family has been reusing ribbons and decorations on gifts for years, some as long as i can remember. i just got my own place this year, and it was a bit sad wrapping gifts without any of those ribbons or fake holly branches i've been seeing every christmas for the last 10+ years...
yeah, everyone believes the guy who claims to print taco bell sauce packets, but nobody believes the guy who had a taco bell sauce packet fall behind his microwave.
dude don't doubt reddit. there will be a video of your midget by morning.
the point is that it's not pre-2012 like slivbodiv said. it's 2012 or later.
so how does it work? are you printing flat or onto a tube or what? how do you maintain food safety?
hi from central us! my dad was just talking earlier about how bad you guys are having it right now. yipes.. drink lots of water, friend!
currently in a similar situation, i placed some cushions on the floor and sleep there, 8/10 would recommend
tokyo checking in; this is less of a problem when you sleep on floor level
same i just finished up with my oceanside neighborhood community and devoted an entire block for the sauce packets.
you show me this highly interesting redditor, that can backup his life's story, and i'll eat my last carolina reaper pepper pod and share the youtube video, here.
but it doesn't mean it's legit like the person they were replying to said. the person believes it's stages and the copyright date doesn't prove it either way.
southern canada(toronto) here. how's the weather in the west. also i concur with the us about englands bed problem
hey! currently 46 degrees celsius...114 farenheit. really dry and hot...had some water but rehydrating with lots of beer:d
temperatures up to about 117 degrees fahrenheit today. was not fun working in a factory without a/c today
i'm sure they probably had similar emails. the only thing that could have stood out about mine is that it was about 2 pages long..
same here, bought manhattan and dedicated all of the buildings to sauce packets.
we don't very well come outside, the lord forbids it
the last time someone made a personal challenge on reddit, they literally ate a dick. you need to step up your game.
fuckin snow everywhere. save me from his frozen hellscape
damn, dude.. sounds like hell. stay safe over there.
same here, just bought taco bell and devoted the entire sauce factory for my consumption.
those gals made some very entertaining commentary. definitely better.
this is the most aggressive handshake i've ever seen
presidents of the world are working on the bicep curls as we speak
the shoulder-grapple, the micro-adjustments in stance, flexible elbow gimbals calculating, measuring, judging - then a snappy shoulder recoil, eye-contact release, and rounding it all up with a fantastic stance assertion. bob i'd give it an overall rating of 4.8.
i'm unlikely to ever shake hands with donald trump, but if i do i'm going to wear a fake arm for the event and watch him rip it straight off. i'll have to practice my wilhelm scream too.
look at trudeau's jaw, you can see him tense his body when trump tries to pull his hand. that was all on purpose. we live in weird times
that's clever, bracing the inevitable "super awkward pull-in" by putting your left hand on his shoulder. well done, trudeau.
jt definitely studied the game tape and came fully prepared.
i feel like this is something trump learned in the 80s at some business seminar where people act like doing business is an animalistic struggle for dominance. lots of talk about being the "alpha".
you can bet your ass melania is watching this clip on replay tonight.
he didn't get pulled in but look at the white knuckles on that hand shake. ouch.
this is hilarious. if you watch it trump tried to pull him in twice and couldn't. i am certain trudeau was ready for it.
trump couldn't get the pull-in so he forced the upper hand. but trudeau was ready for that so he made sure to sneak in the high thumb to show who's really on top.
i want someone to go the opposite route in preparing for his handshake yank power move bs. instead of bracing against it, go with it, fake a trip, and headbutt that fucker right in the nose. the more cameras the better.
ya know, i still get surprised each time that i remember that trump is president. like, legit. i always have a moment or two of "why are we talking about trump? oh, right. the presidency."
at least canada has a ruler who prepares for diplomatic meetings.
well..... looks like we are going to war with canada now
a canadian refused to hug the man. that should tell you something.
god i hate assholes who play bullshit power games with what is supposed to be a friendly greeting.
it's going to be intreresting to watch him greeting the indian prime minister when he greets with a namsate
context? i don't understand. who's doing the pulling?
right away jt went in for the arm/shoulder grab which is a sign of dominance. trump did too but a split second late which threw him off. i would not be surprised if jt practiced for this to prevent being pulled. if i had to shake trumps hand i'd give him the pull before he had a chance. but then his trumpions would flip out and claim i was being aggressive.
remove the 35 age restriction on running for president and change it to a 350 benchlift restriction
the other option is to go completely limp and when trump jerks you off balance, you just fall down into his arms making the entire thing even more awkward.
i would love if we got a world leader who just couldn't give less of a fuck and did stupid shit like this all the time
times have been this way. the whole handshake = mindgame thing is not anything new
coach: you know this prick is going to go for the early power pull, so let your left arm linger on his shoulder and use it for leverage.
at the very end of the gif, you can see trump's expression's like "ait i see you came prepared lets see what you got bitch"
i know. or those weird pick-up guys that teach you how to "get any woman!".
seriously, it's like when he couldn't pull him in he just went for the full-on bone crushing.
see that hand go straight to donalds upper arm, squeezing the muscle to prevent donald from getting a good yank back right from the start? then asserting his dominance by holding firm till the end and that smile afterwords, that's a man who knew what he was doing i've never felt such national pride
holy hell that trudeau smile is charming as fuck.
trudeau beat trump in the shake-off. i...i think canada just became the greatest nation in the world. there can be only one.
as a canadian, you guys suck for making our prime minister do something so childish.
might as well let them annex us and get it over with.
apparently this is how our president shakes people's hands. it's like a business thing, the way tries to intimidate whoever he is speaking with. squeeze their hand as hard as you can, dont let go and pull them into you, very strange.
i for one am excited for president ronnie coleman.
justin trudeau's father. interesting figure, that man.
it wasn't his fault. the guy on on the left (his right) fucked it up.
trudeau's jaw clench looks like a "nice try you little shit"
looks like trump is used to having the advantage of surprise. trudeau had his left foot forward giving him a better bracing position than trump with his feet in line.
so he just awkwardly pulled himself closer to trudeau lol
he looks like he braced for the pull, too. posted with his left arm, engaged the core, i imagine he slightly bent the knees. probably spent all week with his trainer on those cable+bar things. "nope! shift those important meetings about our commitments to world conflict! i don't want to look like a bitch on tv!"
don't you worry about blank. let me worry about blank.
and he did that being high af ,i can't do that kind of shit while i'm high
glad to see someone not let the 70 year old man pull them off balance.
i've never felt such national pride for canada and i'm from new orleans.
same strategy as clinton used to avoid arafat kissing him when they met. clinton put his hand on his shoulder to keep him from leaning in to kiss him.
feeling national pride because trudeau held up to trumps aggressive handshake tactics. very canadian.
holy shit... i'm caught off guard by the difference in foot size lol.., is it the angle or does trump have feet as small as his hands?
i saw a special on the history channel once about the importance of body language among world leaders and powerful people, and they specifically mentioned the arm grab and patting of hands during a handshake. apparently whoever has the limb that is closest to the camera, in this case trudeau with the arm grab, is seen as the dominant one in the exchange, and leaders often try to play to this when meeting in public areas where there are photos being taken. i found it very interesting and i look for it all the time now.
trudeau's face is saying "i'm gonna give it to you so hard and deep you're not going to sit down for a week."
trudeau is one the sexiest heads of state i've ever seen.
it's a great day for canada, and therefore the world.
fun fact: in canada, apologizing is not legally considered to be admitting to a crime, since we say it so often out of habit.
it was just after a morning radio interview during an election campaign. my opinion is that this was the biggest single moment that lost latham the election. he was already trying to water down bully accusations at the time but this cemented them.
please sign here mr. president. "ain't nothin but a peanut!"
glad i'm not the only one wondering what the hell a benchlift is...
this was the same interview where he claimed rage against the machine was his favorite band. tom morello of rage against the machine responded to this incongruency with the following: "don't mistake me, i clearly see that ryan has a whole lotta "rage" in him: a rage against women, a rage against immigrants, a rage against workers, a rage against gays, a rage against the poor, a rage against the environment. basically the only thing he's not raging against is the privileged elite he's groveling in front of for campaign contributions."
didn't he do a pirouette when the queen turned her back?
impressive. eyes at least 98% closed and still makes the last second adjustment.
he's like "i should've thought that one out". haha
yeah because he's not subtle at all it's so ridiculous how he shakes hands
he looks so prepared. the arm on shoulder to hold distance, the wide stance for stability meaning the only thing trump could do was pull himself closer
seriously, all the talk has been about the tiny hands but if this photo is real, those feet are some seriously creepy little fuckers.
dude saw it coming and prepared a defense. solid gamesmanship.
"when you get into an elevator with a woman, press a higher number than her and then make a big deal about it."
you gotta watch out. old man strength is like monkey strength.
we are all canadians on this blessed day. greetings from mars.
small passive aggresive gestures are canadian specialities
profession: senator, strip club manager. natural progression i guess.
was he a boxer outside of that one publicity/charity bout?
holy shit... holy holy shit. so small hands, such small feet. it all makes sence now. trump has got the worlds largest small-dick issue there is.
it sounds silly but i imagine after world leaders saw the gorsuch and abe handshakes they probably have given thought as to how to avoid being yanked in by trump lol... textbook form by trudeau, film will be studied and taught for years to come.
head of government. technically speaking canada does not have a head of state, as the queen is the state, but for simplicity's sake we say the monarch is the head of state, with the governor general serving as their viceregal representative. but yes, he is rather attractive for a head of government.
wait, in other countries you are considered admitting to a crime if you say sorry? well that's not very nice.
do they viscerally dislike each other or is it just something about image for the campaign?
yes. when nixon was recorded calling him an asshole, his comeback was "i've been called worse things by better people." i'd like to be able to use that line some day.
i'll always love how enthusiastically the guy starts clapping and nodding after that.
then there's obama smile during when he realizes what a mess it is. good times.
makes you wonder if there was a meeting where they decided on strategy. now i'm picturing a team of trudeau staffers huddled around a conference table, watching replays of trump handshakes to understand his technique. this is followed by some practice runs, one of the staff takes the place of trump trying to pull jt over while he experiments with different postures to see which provides the most stability. personally i think a much simpler response is to crush his hand as soon as he yanks. it's not like he's going to come out and say another world leader's handshake was too strong for him. they should spread the word before trump attends a major conference of world leaders. that should help him break the habit. and it's not like they are lacking in grip strength. everybody knows politicians are the biggest bunch of wankers there are.
as someone with small hands and feet, i should be defensive of people with small feet and hands. not trump. let him have it.
seriously. why haven't i seen a million jokes about his tiny feet?
i'd negotiate vigorous trade policies with that man.
was australia's pm just really weak on the handshake over the phone or something then? horrible horrible call, i didn't even get a handshake. sad.
dress like her dad, it releases a hormone called moanatonin.
i believe there is another, less pc term that fits trumps other characteristics more appropriately.
*a great day for canada, and therefore the world!*
the prime addendum to the national pastime of door-holding is the passive-aggressive "you're welcome" if you aren't thanked after holding said door.
depends on whether you care about the whole power stance bs really. although if you have to deal with someone who clearly cares like trump does(going by his multiple near bear attacks on other people he shakes hands with) outfoxing them is probably pretty satisfying
looks like he's about to break into a "we are number one" number
mark latham already had a reputation of being ill tempered, with one alleged story of him punching a taxi driver leaving him with a broken arm. this incident helped the undecided voters make up their minds about which party to vote for in 2004 aus federal election to which the incumbent prime minister john howard (the guy latham shook hands with) win again but also win a majority of seats in the australian senate which is a very rare event. in his post-politics life, he's been quite controversial. he's also the only former leader of a major australian political party to have endorsed donald trump for president, which is surprising considering the party he was leader of (aust. labor party) is a centrist/centre-left party.
it looks like he read a cheesy self help book about negotiating that poorly described a strong/firm handshake.
yes, he is raging *against* the machine. as in the machine is next to him and he's raging next to it.
no way he wears a size 12 shoe. not according to the photographic evidence. my guess is a 9.
not sure why you were down voted for insinuating buttsex with our prime minister.
quick, somebody give me something to be angry about
you're speaking of the kind of strength drawn from a type of mental deficiency?
honestly, you gotta double play the power card. "oh wow. you gotta let me teach you how to shake a hand like a real man, i'm not sure your dad ever taught you, that wasn't very good"
when are they scheduled to face off? that handshake is going to be madness. my money is on putin winning that one.
as my father likes to say, "strong like bull, smart like stump."
that's gonna be a hell of a handshake but a losing one for don. i wouldn't bet against a former kgb agent on anything.
i used to hear "strong like tractor, smart like tractor"
i dunno, i think vladimir is going to underplay it, not show his true power, but at the same time not let trump defeat him. if it's a win, it'll be subtle.
i used to hear "as strong as an ox and twice as smart"
could you imagine living a life to where you find yourself in this situation and think, "oh, thank god, it's just leo."
it's a little weird that there's someone in the bushes filming this. the paparazzi are truly a strange bunch. or whoever leo got to film this.
leo is dressed like it's 85 outside and jonah is dressed like it's 55.
god damn jonah can inflate and deflate like a pufferfish for what ever role he is currently playing
jonah dresses exactly how i thought he would, leonardo on the other hand looks like a dad on holiday looking for a cheap pub.
this goes under: jokes that celebrities play on each other that normal people can't.
i like to think that when leo hugged jonah and held him close for a moment jonah whispered in his ear, *i'll never let go jack*
he's playing the new "celebrity go", which helps you track and catch celebrities irl. get enough and you get a free autographed restraining order.
"shit i see leo across the street." "shit he's coming my way." "shit he's doing the fake fan act again." *leo hugs jonah.* "shit. shit. shit. shit."
my wife has this life. but my name is leo and i sneak up behind her a lot.
lol i didn't know how to word this thought, but you laid it out perfectly. it's like they are on a whole other level of existence. "oh thank god another famous person, he won't act insane"
if i was a celebrity, id use reverse phycology on the paparazzi and stalk them and take photos of them
photos in los angeles confuse me. half of the people can be wearing shorts and flip flops, and the other half jeans and a (light) jacket. all while the sun is blazing. as someone from a place with less ideal weather it's weird
for the rest of the world, what's the temperature?
unless jonah identifies as a bear that's not going to happen.
if i ever see my friends when i'm out and about i'll sneak up on them and try to mess with them in some way -- like i'll walk way too close to them, or pretend to dig into their wallets. doesn't happen super often but it's always a laugh. even normal people can pretend to be crazies!
we all saw you flinch, mr. jackman. we all saw you.
to me that kid seems pretty practiced in his stance and that lunge, and then has this shit-eating macho grin afterwards that seems really out of place for someone that young.
why does no one recognise henry cavill in this thread??
jesus they sound like they're filming wild animals or something.
impressive he could keep the camera so steady while obviously masturbating
that is some next level shit creepy. nice nice nice (shuttering noises)
and yet here we are watching the gif and linking the source video ensuring these creepy fucks continue having an audience.
start your own magazine! headline could be: taking photos wasn't the only thing he was doing behind the bushes!
dude, you always bring a jacket with you here. businesses *blast* their a/c. like, all of them.
and then your friend reflex elbows you to the face while you try to grab his wallet.
....the fuck is up with the wu tang logo on that dude's notepad/tablet in the first gif??? really not what i'd expect to see in an interview with bernie sanders on bloomberg.
i never understood this. flinching when someone fakes a punch is an evolutionary trait and means that your nervous system is working correctly.
that the little kid actually scared him, that he actually flinched and played it off like "oh, good show, haha, cheerio"
he does seem to be, aside from the whole raising awful children part.
aside from being one of the many actors to play superman in the past decade, what notable roles has he played? honest question because i have no idea who he is. i haven't watched man of steel or batman v superman yet, never been much of a superman fan.
why do you think he was in the company of like, five super-models? do you think he had sex with each one individually? or like 'group we're all just having fun with our bodies' sex? i always wondered.
running for your life (from shia labeouf.) he's brandishing a knife. (it's shia labeouf.) lurking in the shadows hollywood superstar shia labeouf. living in the woods, (shia labeouf.) killing for sport, (shia labeouf.) eating all the bodies actual cannibal, shia labeuf!
if you just watch the gif, the paparazzi aren't getting any money. if you go to tmz.com or buy gossip magazine you are supporting the creepy paparrazi . but watching this gif or not doesn't really change anything. edit : i am not supporting paparazzi . if you don't click on the source video and don't go on gossip site , you are not supporting the paparazzi.
daniel radcliffe used to wers the sam outfit for mulitple occasions so the paparazzi could take photos for several months but it would look like the same day
rofl, "you weren't very nice, you were hiding and running and not letting us take pictures of you.. and your not even worth chasing.." apparently trying to not get harassed by people with cameras makes you a mean person.. god those paparazzi's are fucking top notch assholes... fucking hope a celebrity knocks em out... or worse.
haha that's great. i'd be super annoying with it. almost creeper status, follow them home, stand literally outside their windows, be real obvious (use bright as hell flash etc)
the footage will be shaky from the aforementioned penis play
36 chambers came out over 20 years ago brah, just because a lot of us have real jobs now doesn't mean we stopped liking the wu. protect ya ~~neck~~ tablet.
well, his attitude towards his parents as a teen made me feel like he was heading in the wrong direction. then his treatment of his cousin made him seem like a jerk. glad to see his life got turned upside down.
i get the impression they're not awful, really, just ridiculously sheltered.
basically if you're a model or on a reality tv show you might be flown out to ibiza (for example) with other cast members / models, with the primary objective of raising your profile a bit, as well as keeping the 'talent' (paha) happy. you'll basically have your agent (or whoever - i imagine your publicist if you're bigger time) call you up and say 'hey, x,y and z are hanging out on a boat later / in x club later, a,b and c will also be there' and they'll hook you up. it's usually something like that (connections through pr / talent agencies) but it's so fucking odd. a mutual friend was on a big reality show in the uk and randomly ended up on a yacht with dicaprio playing board games with him (and 20+ other people). bizarre.
so when the yacht docks at an island the people on the yacht can take the bike into town instead of having to walk
took me a second to decipher. so for others as slow as i am, "everyone else in his [nominee] group used to think" meaning "other actors nominated for best actor used to think 'oh, thank god, it's just leo.'"
well i was mostly just making an off-handed comment rather than trying to preach a point against supporting paparazzi. but to continue the discussion, viewing the gif and upvoting the post indirectly supports the entire paparazzi industry because now people will search where this gif comes from. i mean it has already happened, the first comment i replied to already posted the source video. it all helps support what they do. but again, just making a comment, not trying to protest the industry or this post or anything.
i hate you only had to say kim for me to know who you're talking about.
hmm not surprising. my friend's older brother works at the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach. a lot of celebrities go there and paparazzi will pay my friend's brother $100 to call them when a celebrity arrives
video stability has progressed leaps and bounds on the hero 4. now i can video tape myself and family dinners with an entire back massager in my anus and you can't even tell
either they caught channing mid blink or he took a toke too.
the zoom-in on this gif always gets me. he is as un-phased by the taunt as is humanly possible
sheltered, wealthy, and with bloated egos. will smith has a giant ego, but he carries it well with his charisma. his kids did not inherit the charisma.
s/o for the eli5, for some reason that comment didn't compute.
thats true, reddit does get mentioned in higher profile article around the web, oh and twitter apparently.
that's different, that's actually super fucked up and invasive. they're talking about the celebrity's own publicist tipping off paparazzi for promotion, a hotel front desk attendant tipping off paparazzi about hotel guests is morally an awful thing to do, super firable offense.
believe he was the first actor to have 3 films reach number one at the box office in one year
hero 4 does not have any hardware stabilization. i don't know why i'm even debating this.
he seems to be holding it together though, jonah looks fucked up.
jonah talked about this interview on howard stern. he said he was in a bad mood and the interviewer was just an asshole from the first moment, belittling and making fun of him, treating him like he was riding seth rogan's coat tails. he said he basically checked out and just didn't want to deal with the guy. in the printed interview, of course, you only here the annoyed things jonah is saying. he also said that right after the interview, he knew he messed up -- he said he called seth rogan right away and said so, and that it would be bad.
allegedly he is a bit of a dick irl but it's all good cause i'm never meeting him and his movies are nice.
he's so in the zone he predicted exactly what was going to happen, by observing muscle twitches, pupil dilations, and subtle changes in the air around him.
his kids weren't born with the ability to handle being famous. will has 30 years experience dealing with fans and publicity and whatnot. maturation and time make all teenagers into real people, and jaden is no exception.
weren't those the $20 million days as well? i know he had a great run of like 6 movies where he was paid $20million each
i met him once, granted it was a long time ago (he was promoting super bad at the time) but he was lovely. as was michael cera and christopher mintz-plasse
you make it sounds like he's an anime character damn it.
also don't forget that will didn't grow up famous. though it's been a long time, he can remember when he was just 'regular'. his kids can't relate to that. they've always been in the spotlight.
i don't know about you, but i keep them in my balls.
i would like to be included. please share reference as "bone apple tea" sounds very appetizing
iirc, the cable guy was his first $20 million film. ace ventura is actually a fairly small film - the entire budget is $15 million. dumb and dumber is $17 milliom. even the mask is $23 million.
and the band plays waltzing matilda and the old men still answer to the call but year after year their numbers get fewer some day no one will march there at all
no. this has been repeatedly debunked, but is re-uploaded every year. he's a russian military vet. he was not the last of his squad as of when this photo was taken. he was upset because he couldn't keep up with the rest of the parade.
my grandfather was a ww2 vet. he was a combat medic in the 9th infantry and went all the way from africa into the concentration camps to help liberate the jews. he had some amazing stories about the war, some horrifying, some hilarious, some uplifting. he passed away at 92 back in 2011. i miss him very much. now i am a physician and every time i see a ww2 vet i take extra time to talk to them and thank them for their service. when you meet a ww2 vet, stop and talk to them a bit. they are living history. they all have amazing stories and there are fewer of them every day, this picture really emphasizes that point. edit to add: wow! never been gilded before, thank you!
saddest pic i've ever seen but grateful to him to my last days
when i was a kid we would go to the vfw for dinner about once a month with my family. in one corner were bottles of wine with lists of names nest to or written on them. my dad told me that units (? he was in the military not me, think like 10 guys not sure i'm using the right word) would buy a bottle of wine and the last guy alive would drink the whole bottle. i thought it was really cool... i was dumb.
"'the veteran was upset that he was behind the column with other veterans and could not catch up with them,' he said." i just want to pick him up and carry him to his squad :(
sad to say i fell for it. thank you for your service. hard to believe that karma means so much to some people that they would propagate this false message
and now every april i sit on my porch and i watch the parade pass before me and i watch my old comrades, how proudly they march reliving old dreams of past glory and the old men march slowly, all bent, stiff and sore the forgotten heroes from a forgotten war and the young people ask, "what are they marching for?" and i ask myself the same question
ya cunt. i'm not supposed to cry on australia day. that, and only 19, always make me misty eyed.
and the band played waltzing matilda and the old men respond to the call but as year follows year, more old men disappear someday no-one will match there at all.... i used to busk and i sang lots of these old songs, i had to correct you, wrong lyrics, they don't rhyme your way...
now this picture is even more depressing. i should never have looked in the comments.
my grandfather was a gunner in a liberator. he almost never talked about his time in the war.
i couldn't agree more. my grandfather was a ww2 vet as well and is now 92 years old (still living). he fought for the americans in the battle of the bulge - he was a half track driver. he is still living, but he lives in another state. i used to love hearing his stories, but now i think his mind is beginning to go and i don't get to hear from him or my grandmother as often as i used to. he has a hard time remembering simple details such as the names of my children and stuff. as often as i can i try to call, even though they can't talk much anymore, because i want to hold onto him for as long as i can.
i work with a lot of elderly vets. please be careful what you talk to them about. i run into some that haven't spoken a word about the war since they got home. but absolutely be friendly to them and let them talk your ear off.
thank you for taking the time to do this. it seems people forget about history. all i'm hearing lately is protests and arguments about politics. it's good to read comments such as yours.
i always see them at the grocery store or whatever with their ww2 or vietnam hats on and i'm a history nerd and i really want to talk to them about their stories or whatever or thank them but i don't want to say anything to them for fear of them not wanting to talk or whatever. am i wrong in this because i really do want to thank n them
would they mind if i hugged them. i never served myself, but my mom's side of the family is former military. grandpa was army, two of my uncles were navy (one passed away a little over 10 years ago, possibly from mesothelioma), and one uncle was a helicopter technician in the air force. i also have many, many friends who have served/are serving. i have immense respect for the people who serve this country, even if i could never do it myself.
i really just want to give him a hug, and walk with him
i don't know, that actually seem to sting a bit more.
well, they don't specify why he couldn't keep up, but to me it's still sad to imagine an old soldier trying to march, but his health won't let him stay in line with his brothers.
i read this in the tune of the wreck of the edmond fitzgerald
thanks for that, hadn't heard this version and it was magnificent
i've never heard that version - made the old girl cry .. that's not an easy task! thanks for sharing
only 19 fucks me up every time, even just thinking about it. my dad is a vietnam vet and he was never the same again, according to my late grandmother. he was just a kid forced to go to war. my grandmother told me before he left he came to her crying, "i don't want to shoot anybody, mum" he returned a different person with ptsd and lifelong depression.
you'll get used to it. pictures get re-uploaded and debunked all the time here.
that really sucks. my grandfather served on lst during d-day at omaha beach. hes 96 now and not long for this world. the greatest generation will soon be no more, but they live on through their children and grandchildren. their sacrifices will never be forgotten
my father has just started opening up about vietnam. i'm 35 and i've been asking about it since i was a kid. he earned a bronze star and never talked about it until a few months ago. it was one of my favorite moments of my father. at that moment he became my friend. not less of my father, but just an added friend. he never showed any emotions until then, and now when we talk we joke and laugh a lot. it really opened up our relationship to have me just sit and listen. he's been keeping it buried for so long.
my grandad was a gunner too, ball turret. he only told me funny stories from the war, like walking over stuck-open bomb doors to grab lunch. he never really talked much about anything serious. maybe it's a gunner thing. we all think he's lying, but he claimed he only shot at railway lines to disrupt the transport chain. but there had to be air fights.
a friend of my family was a stalingrad vet (one of the few german ones that survived) he spent something like 10 years in russia as a prisoner. he only spoke about the war once, to his daughter.
my grandfather was in big red one. fought in north africa and the european theater. landed at omaha beach in normandy. he did not like to talk about the war and was not at all interested in bragging about his medals. he could only say how lucky he was.
yeah my grandfather was a colonel in the polish army and was held captive. he passed away before i really knew, i was just a child don't remember much of him. my father said he rarely ever talked about the war, but i can understand. why would you want to relive those days? can't imagine what it would be like.
my grandfather was a telegrapher in a nazi submarine. he didn't like the nazis and my great grandparents have secretly hidden many jewish families in our house. my grandfather got into war imprisonment of the soviets. he also never talked about it. not to my grandmother and not to my mother (i was seven years old when he passed away).
my grandfather fought in the korean war and refused to ever talk about it. i can't imagine what he must have seen.
my grandfather trained the bombadeers who dropped the atomic bomb and he had a lot to do with the norden sight. he never ever talked about anything bc everything was top secret and then just became habit. i'm sad i'll never know more since he's gone.
i'm just afraid that if i do say "mr ___, tell me some stories about the war" they'll break down and struggle to tell it as emotions rush over them or something
not op but my great uncle liberated a camp or it's possible it was "abandoned" by the time tbey showed up but can't remember which one as i heard this from my father. possible it was dacau? i only met the uncle a few times. my father said they opened up the locked train cars and they found nothing but bodies and this is the only thing i remember clearly. i can ask my dad tomorrow for more details, the uncle passed a few years ago.
some might. but most wont, i imagine. it never hurts to ask, but some salty sea dogs are still salty after all these years.
this is the most passive aggressive way i have ever seen someone complain about a repost.
and op just added the bit about him being the last alive in his unit for more grief porn karma. but holy shit, he's gotten 100k link karma in 3 weeks, so i guess he knows what he's about.
glad i'm not the only one who noticed it. it's kinda the best part of the picture.
i wonder why he doesn't use a wheelchair? dudes old school af
yeah, really though. did they all leave him behind?
i didn't cry at the op, but i got pretty close reading that line. how sad. why didn't they wait for him?
yeah i was going to say he looks way too young to have fought in ww2. if he was 20 in 1944 he'd be 93. and that's towards the end of the war.
unrelated, but i love people who bring up that song. we're friends now.
that sucks mate, sorry to hear it. chronic depression is bad enough, but ptsd from what vets have seen... fuck that for a joke. hope you can have a good aussie day anyway.
thats not why its even more depressing. it's somehow worse (atleast to drill2kill) thinking that this man is so saddened by not being able to participate fully in something that he identifies with and something that surely has taken up a huge part of his life
wow that's amazing. my grandfather was a radar tech on navy planes patrolling the south atlantic for u-boats for most of the war. it's true, they definitely left their mark on this world.
i can't even imagine the experience, the level of suffering that would just sink in and never leave you.
my grandfather, too! yours and mine were some of the few to survive that long in that unit. he also doesn't talk much about it, just funny stories of drinking on leave.
i've posted this before but it is worth repeating. my dad's dad served us army in the philippines in wwii. i don't know what he went through, but he had nightmares for the rest of his life that were so terrifying that he would wake screaming, "snakes!" eventually my grandmother couldn't take his violent kicking during his night terrors and demanded separate bedrooms.
my jewish grandfather on my mom's side was a tank commander for the us army and died of lung cancer a few years before i was born. my grandfather on my dad's side was (as far as we know) in the german infantry. died in the war. both grandmothers are dead as well. i'll never know what really happened to any of them.
if the stories out there are even half true, being a german prisoner of the soviets was a horrible thing, and i don't blame him for not talking about it.
try to find out if he is in any declassified documents.
"i spent four years away from my wife in dogfights with zeroes over the pacific. those four years in my f6 hellcat were the only peace and quiet i ever got!"
my dad was in the vietnam war and i've heard 2 stories. one was during football practice and the other was when he was drunk. and they weren't really even stories. for some people it's just too hard to talk about, especially since my dad was a green beret and with airborne. so he saw some shit, was even active during a bunch of the pablo escobar stuff. i'm just hoping one day he sits me down and tells me some stories.
you could try to phrase it differently, in a way that elicits a positive memory or at least a neutral one! like "hey mr ____, what was your mos (job)?" or "what was your most favorite day while serving?"
i think it's key here not to just ask for war stories. and rightfully so, that war is most likely one of the worst moments in their life. not only for what they might have had to do, but for what people often find out about themselves when confronted with traumatic events. instead, ask about their life before/after the war, what they did for a living, things that changed for them, etc. some may not be willing to share their war stories, but i'd bet most would be willing to share about themselves.
99% chance they won't. fragile snowflakes these men are not. and even so, it was 70 years ago. most of the ones i've met welcome a chance to pass on their stories.
damn, reading this makes me a bit angry... people like your great grandfather sacrificed everything they have, they shouldn't have been treated this way, i guess canadians weren't so nice back then
probably more grateful, considering what the russian soldiers went through and their exceptional contribution to the war effort.
there's absolutely no way to do it aggressively tho lol. /u/ctatey23 is brilliant
no idea why anyone would allow themselves to be annoyed by this. this is like the 6th time it's been posted in over 3 years. big whoop! there are plenty more things worth getting pissed off over. going by his comment history it seems he's reported it also. sad.
so basically, it's from russia in 09 and he was crying because he couldn't catch up with the rest of his group. that's sad for an entirely different reason.
based on how his arms reach past his base and how wide his sleeves are, i'd wager he mostly moves around on his hand and the rolly board is just for long distances. a big, bulky wheel chair would just slow him down.
probably because it was a parade and they don't typically wait for one person. i think it's kind of cute though in its own way. men should cry more. it feels good.
iirc a lot of 16 year olds lied about their age and signed up anyway, so, assuming 20 as a fighting age may be a little high. insane what 16-17 year olds had to handle
be a fat cunt, have em both. and the steak. maybe some of them fackin prawns too. fuck yeah bbq day :)
american prisoners of the japs... honestly a toss up as to which was worse.
i saw an iwo jima veteran at the store i work at. the area i live in is home to many vets from vietnam, but when i saw that guy in the "iwo jima survivor" hat i was literally star struck. edit :spelling
i'm going to do this from now on. i work at a diner with a lot of old men wearing wwii vet baseball caps. some of them look a bit too young to be in wwii though...
i see. thanks so much. i love listening to war stories.
i agree with you 100%. it takes a lot to break these men down, they've been to hell and back. at least the soviet men had, that's to my knowledge. yet to meet a usa vet.
and honestly, this guy deserves to reposted more. not everyone sees these posts, there's new users each day that find this interesting.
i don't so much get annoyed by reposts themselves. i get annoyed with bullshit titles on reposts. reposters pretending they created something, or they did something, or they took a picture of something, or whatever it can be. now to be fair, this repost doesn't say it happened today or this most recent victory day or whatever, but he also wasn't the last living survivor of his squad. i personally would be in favor of deleting every bullshit-titled repost until people learn to just title things correctly.
i don't think so. ever needed a wheelchair before? your thighs are enormous muscles - it's pretty damn exhausting to make your arms do their work.
...aaaand...this thing is somehow better for those circumstances?!?
garlic prawns are some good shit. swing by a fish and chippie.
those men loaded onto the higgins boats and hit the beach knowing they were going into a meat grinder, but they still went. that is true bravery. the world is in their debt.
those truly are a dying breed. and from my limited experience, it's even more awkward when you thank them, because it was one of the most costly battles in terms of mortalities/area gained.
it was still possible to lie about your age and get in back then. there were men who served as young as 14 or 15.
do the hats actually say wwii because at this point korean war veterans and even vietnam veterans are "old" as well. i actually heard someone say a 70 year old man was way too old to have fought in vietnam and laughed since my dad was drafted during vietnam and is 69 himself.
also if a person has emotions rush over them and cries, that's awesome. sit in that with them and you are really living.
absolutely. war is utterly savage, and if this opens up someone's eyes when it gets posted, totally worth it. if it was being posted every other day or week, or maybe even every month for a long period however. then i could understand it to a degree.
the higgins boats. why didn't they design them to open on both sides instead? or the rear? the shore defense would then have to choose one side or the other.
this is true. my grandmother had her uncle forge her papers so she could join the marine corps before she was of proper age. she is 92 years old right now but the goverment thinks she is 94.
my father did this, though i think to escape racism as much as anything else.
this, right here, is the best piece of advice you can get. write it down.
i think it was so they could fit jeeps on them and drive them off
saving private ryan has given people a skewed view of what did most of the killing on d-day. the germans had a variety of mortars, anti-tank guns, and light artillery emplaced on the bluffs overlooking omaha. entire boats were ripped apart by armor-piercing 50mm and 88mm shells, and many of the tanks that made it to the beach fell victim to them. then, several german batteries of pre-sighted 105mm howitzers opened up on the soldiers as they slogged the 300 meters from the water's edge to the seawall. they still killed a lot of guys, but the most important thing the machine guns did was keep the men pinned down while the various artillery pieces worked them over. changing the location of the ramps won't do much when shells are going in one side and out the other.
my great-grandfather lied to join up for wwi. they found out once he got wounded. but he went and served in wwii as well haha.
my uncle is 65 and was drafted. he ended up being a vietnam war hero. when he told me what he went through, i changed my mind on joining the military. he was forced to go through hell so my dad wouldn't have to. i realized that volunteering for that was just fucking stupid. he insinuated as much and military service stopped with my siblings and i in the family.
i got to see one of the twelve(?) that's left about five years ago on memorial day. there was a ww2 vet kind of nearby and he just stood there and looked at the higgins boat for a looooooong time. he had a mixture of pain and happiness on his face. he seemed happy to hear there were only 12 of the boats left.
what did change, in the years after, however, was that amphibious assaults in open landing craft largely went away. look at the marine corps' amphibious assault vehicle. and if you want to get to a beach of your choice, fast, the lcac. or even better, the helicopter
is anyone else convinced this is a guise for a town full of dark wizards?
i once heard that the town looks like johnny depp as soon as all the snow melts.
pretty distasteful in 2016 to still acknowledge grindelwald after all of the atrocities committed against wizarding kind. like i get that there's history, but c'mon, its pretty racist.
swiss resident in the neighboring town of lauterbrunnen here - it looks nothing like this right now, on the contrary. up until around 1800m it looks like spring, yellow and green grass. very little snow ):]
just imagine that someone, in one of those houses, is all cozy and warm, wrapped in his favorite blanket that his grandmother knitted for him when he was a child. he's got a nice, warm cup of cocoa and a box of tissues, and is masturbating to something we cant even conceive of on 4chan.
this looks just lovely. ski all day, sit around the fire with friends all night. winter is awesome.
this reminds me of those tiny collectable christmas houses. it looks so surreal..
i assume there is a choo-choo train encircling the entire village.
i've been there in the summer and it is a lovely place. recommended. also, i am convinced j. k. rowling's character's name is based on this town. which would mean the proper pronunciation should be the original german-sounding one: **"grin-del-vald"**. not "grin-dull-wold". it would make the character name sound more intimidating, imho.
how much would a week stay cost me over there? i really wanna go to switzerland, im curious how much (daily) hostels or places to sleep cost.
i can't escape the grinch. my son is nearly 2 and saw the grinch on tv about 3 weeks ago. i have now seen the grinch approximately twice a day for 3 weeks.
whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes, he stood there on christmas eve hating the whos. staring down from his cave, with a sour grinchy frown, at the warm, lighted windows below in their town.
i want to go here so bad now! can you images having a christmas here
thats all i can think of when i see the name grindelwald
not that they're hiding or anything... starting with the name...
okay so who else is a bit miffed that we're getting depp rather than farrell for the big bad? honestly, i've rarely seen any actor who can do a villain quite as good as colin farrell.
is your emoji a mischievous smile with a unibrow or a frown face with a block head?
virtual duck: swiss citizen here, born in america. i am considering going to graduate school in switzerland. do you think that is a good idea for me. ? does switzerland have a good reputation for education as compared to the states ?
the houses look really nice. and the scenery is tops, too. must cost a fortune to live there!
this place like most of western europe struggles for snow over christmas. it is not normally this covered until mid january. christmas in canada is something i would like to try.
what are those lights near the top of the mountain? they seem quite beautiful.
please don't remind me. i'm not looking forward to dealing with his insufferable presence for four more movies.
isn't that the dark wizard that dumbledore had the hots for?
well it was polyjuice so the possibility is there that we will get colin farrell back as a good guy in the next movie
i was upset, i couldn't take my eyes off farrell in the film and i don't think depp will do even half as good a job. i'm especially worried about how he will pay the ultimate duel between grindelwald and dumbledore.
and here i am in houston just wishing it wasn't 80 degrees on christmas
mele kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright hawaiian christmas day that's the island greeting that we send to you from the land where palm trees sway here we know that christmas will be green and bright the sun to shine by day and all the stars at night mele kalikimaka is hawaii's way to say merry christmas to you.
lots of canada has green christmases too. varies from year to year and place to place.
we have a colorado low blowing in over manitoba and nw ontario tomorrow. 25-35 cm of snow and 60-70 km/h winds.
currently there's not that much snow where i'm at. your best bet is the mountains and/or near the great lakes aha. ymmv
when 90% of reddit see "the greater good" they make hot fuzz jokes and references... the other 10% see this for the tau propaganda it truly is, and in the glorious god emperor of mankinds name will purge the blue xenos from the universe!
seriously, the worst part of that movie. johnny depp can be great (see: black mass, the first pirates). but as soon as they revealed him, instead of uber-voldemort blondie popular and charismatic wizard hitler, it was weird for the sake of weird wizard mortdecai. and before the reveal, he was everything i could want for the character. ugh such a let down.
i'd be totally fine with that. i just want more colin farrell in my movies dammit! this is the first of his movies i've seen since fright night. and that was like 4 years ago!
well the movies have never actually done justice to a wizard's duel from the books so far, so i'm not optimistic to begin with. i'm just gonna take these with a grain of salt and then wait a decade or a half for the inevitable reboot.
can't wait for fantastic beasts 2 where dumbledore takes grindelwald's elder wand. takes it hard and takes it repeatedly. newt scamander was probably there, observing the mythical beast with two backs.
how exactly do we know this? other than the fact that rowling stated that dumbledore is gay?
jesus. looks like you went to skyrim. what a gorgeous country.
probably light from cars driving on the road, not from a traffic light
i agree, doesn't really feel like christmas here, maybe i'm wrong but it just felt like it was always colder here around this time when i was younger, hell most of the trees haven't even lost their leaves and i'm still periodically cutting grass, so it's almost as though summer never left....
floridian confirming 80 degrees winters and sandmen instead of snowmen
canada is very large, so there are bound to be green places, but there are areas that are perennially well snowed.
in winnipeg, getting ready for some xmas shovelling.
yea collin ferrel kicked so much ass and looked great while doing it. i like johnny depp a lot but i wasn't impressed with his little snippet in the movie.
i honestly would have been excited to see colin ferrell as him for all of the movies but that's just me.
not to mention how goofy it is that wizard hitler was just in disguise as a senior government official. seriously, compare the two options. 1. senior government official is revealed to be a follower of a dark wizard known for murder and magic supremacist philosophy, which makes you wonder how many wizards might secretly support grindelwald. 2. senior government official is actually just hitler. oh shit, we did it guys. we actually caught wizard hitler. some one murk that asshole.
he was good (one of the only bright spots) in season 2 of true detective, if you haven't seen it.
yeah they butchered the final duel in deathly hallows
pretty sure that's going to happen in fantastic beasts 5
well... the fact that rowling stated this. being the author, she kind a has some authority on these things.....
exactly, it's worse :l also san antonian checking in
minnesota checking in. 35 degrees and snow on the ground. yep, wet heat.
yes, i know. the point of my comment was to point out that lots of canada is just like grindelwald in terms of snow, and won't look like pic related until mid to late january. "christmas in canada" isn't necessarily an idyllic postcard experience.
have you ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?
agreed, but depp is a good actor. if we're lucky, he may turn out to be excellent at the role when he actually gets to act grindelwaldy
the spell the american wizard president used at the end of the film wouldnt work on polyjuice
i found the book duel to be ... kinda boring. also the film duel was too long. in the book they just circle each other and talk and then they cast one spell and then it's over ... no battle really. but it was fitting. i liked it as it didnt feel out of place or anything but i must say it was rather anticlimactic.
that sex scene was savage, like i get that they wanted to really promote progressivism, and gay rights within the movie, but dumbledore going raw dog on grindlewald for an uncut 5 minutes straight? might've been a bit too much.
but being gay and having romantic relations with another character are two different things. the former has been confirmed, but i've yet to see confirmation of the latter point.
san antonio here. couldn't even wear my xmas sweater today. :(
lol same! what is this horrible 70-something humidity?!
another minnesotan! it seems like there are tons of us on reddit!
calgary got about 10cm of snow in the last day, looking pretty awesome!
it was newt who cast revelio thought i'd just answer a few questions from below. he would have been "screened", however he was the voldemort of his time. he has the ability to defend himself against the spells and queenie reading his mind. the reason he was "revealed" at the end, wasn't because he they failed to screen him before, but rather that he wanted do be revealed. he wasn't worried, he was proud. he had already done what he wanted, which was to infiltrate the ministry and to find the obscurus and control it. with the obscurus "killed" (we do see part of it float away as newt smirks at it), his current task is over. his new challenge is ahead of him, and the papers will throw his name around once more.
oh, alright. so can we even be sure that colin-farrell-wizard exists?
the worst part is i forgot my workshirt at home and i'm stuck with my hoodie cashiering and pushing carts
some of us are driving to edmonton in the morning. looks great. scary as fuck.
and seriously? i mean the guy's high up in the magical police, and they didn't screen him with a basic spell even once?
he may have existed at one point, but do you really think grindelwald let him live?
oh, how depressing. you should come up to chicago during an arctic tendril and take joy in the -40 temperature. sometimes without windchill!
mcdonald's pr team is going to love waking up to this in the morning!
this is the quality content you signed up on reddit for.
if it was just the butt and the hole, i would have chuckled. the "warmest greetings" is what fucking killed me. rip me.
why does this gif expand as though i have screen tearing?
i've seen this everywhere the last couple of days, what is the image supposed to be if people didn't scribble in the little fingers???
where is /r/hailcorporate this is clear asstroturfing.
totally worth the advertising on this bad boy. this is generally the result about 30-45 minutes after i indulge with a big mac.
this is the mcmarketing manager's equivalent of a presidential 3am phone call
i think they actually will. this morning i had no desire to go to mcdonalds. i am now headed to mcdonald's to get my hands on one of these cups.
it's been going around for several days, i'm sure they're having trouble finding places to store all the bricks that have been shat.
i wouldn't be surprised this post is part of a marketing campaign.
it's the most accurate advertising for mcdonald's i've ever seen.
and r/gifs is a default sub. today's lucky 10,000 has a rude awakening in store for them.
looks like he cut out the motion in the gif to just a square around the hole to decrease file size, and left the background as the first frame in gif...?
exactly what i was looking for, thanks for this. i was wondering what on earth the original design was supposed to be.
i'm really disappointed this isn't top post! these young kids don't know the young internet legends of goatse and tubgirl
so, without people drawing in the little hands, it wouldn't look like anything remarkable at all. what...why...?
if anything it was god's will this gif was created, giving us joy and laughter in an otherwise miserable 2016.
you can cut the wait time in half by going with a mcgriddle. better than getting your colon irrigated.
it's free viral marketing for them and besides, it's a joke, everyone knows mcd's makes you constipated.
until they see this. two cheeks one cup. i recall the last video doing quite well.
fuckin reddit. post has a brand in it, even though it's negative, it's probably advertising.
i would bet money that it is. welcome, to the post-truth era. 90% of posts are of something everyone thinks is amazing and rare but was actually completely planned or faked.
not actually true. bad press is good press if nobody knows who you are. if they know who you are, bad press is bad press. this is hilarious though, so it might not be bad press.
it makes you get diarrhea? seems like most redditors have digestion issues.
somebody's blowing into the cup for effect. if they didn't add positive pressure, the coffee would have just dribbled out of the hole. they masked out the rest but were too lazy to do more than crop out the money shot with a rectangular mask. source: video editor
it's mittens, right? because all i can see is goatse. trying to find something else but i don't know if its some kind of rorschach blob.
and really... in the end, mcdonald's is going to get a lot of sales out of this... they'll quietly change it to something else, and most likey profit off of the whole thing.
can confirm. designer at a typography/publisher with shit pay. when i see stuff like this, i completely ignore it and act totally surprised if anyone sees it before production. if it's after, i'll also add, "eh, don't worry, we can see it only because we work in the field".
honestly they probably are, it doesn't disparage their quality
not trying to start shit, but doesn't that kinda look like trump under that makeup?
is the 4th dimension time or gravity? cause then it's still just checkers.
i don't know why people seem to have such sensitive digestive systems that are affected so wildly by different fast food places
this isn't really negative though. it doesn't say anything bad about maccas at all. i kind of want to go buy a drink from maccas to see this for myself now. there is nothing about this that says maccas is a bad place.
yeah i thought this was marketing too just from the picture quality, but tbh if this is what marketing looks like now i'm all for it
sorry, when was the "truth era." some magical time before swift boating? watergate? lewinsky? iraq?
yeah, i know. strangely, i feel more inclined to go to mickey ds now - maybe just to be part of the macro crude humor of it all.
yeah and stepping in a *little bit of* dog shit is better than stepping in *a big ol pile of* horse shit.
quick, buy all the cups now and take em to pawn stars in a few years!
my last name is goatse. from about middle school on its been a blessing and a curse
so, i always prided myself in having never seen tubgirl, but these posts made me curious about the history. i tabbed over to an open google page, typed it in looking for a knowyourmeme link and....well fuck it was google images, and not google home. *sigh*
30 minutes after my morning coffee (real coffee not maccas coffee) and i'm poopin toilet or no toilet. only really happens in the morning though...
mcdonalds definitely has a shill army on reddit. shit one their most famous spokespersons for how wholesome and healthy their food is did an ama the other day.
is it though? horse shit is basically grass and usually dry and crumbly, allowing you to easily knock it off. dog shit is gonna smear all up in your treads and the only way to ever get it off is with a hose.
not even close. horse shit doesnt stick and horse shit doesnt smell worse when you break the outer layer. id rather step in horse shit 1000 times than dog shit once.
people seriously go overboard when complaining about starbucks coffee. they offer some good stuff overall. not amazing, life changing coffee but hardly "dog shit'.
"this here is actually a wonderful piece of americana. it's a mcdonald's cup, circa 2016. and these actually had a limited release, because, if you look right here at the mittens, people punched holes in it. when the cup was filled with coffee, the graphics appeared to be a human hind end defecating all over the place." "oh, wow. that is interesting. was that intentional?" "no. it wasn't intentional. so, they actually pulled these from stores relatively quickly. there were, however, a few people who got together on one of the old-time internet websites and decided to collect as many as they could. still, there aren't many of these around any more. i'd say, at auction, you could probably get 100, 200 dollars for this cup alone." -antiques roadshow ca.2087
oh lord, german surnames ... i used to work with a koch, first name, rhoda. you would murder your parents in cold blood, you really would.
do you ever worry about employers googling your name?
mcdonald's is some of the worst fast food i've ever eaten. tasteless, dry, cold, and they never get your order right. it's not even that cheap. but why do we keep going back? only to be disappointed every time?
i mean that's understandable. caffeine stimulates your bowels. can't for the life of me figure out why mcdonalds would make you constipated though
this post is such a blatent plant/advertisment its unreal. i mean just look at the image lol. that wasn't taken on someones phone as they went to their local mcdonalds.
it's pretty well the only thing mcdonald's gets called in australia. this isn't universal?
yeah i'm not a fan but the "it's either good or it's total complete shit" mentality that everyone has is mildly annoying
or give the booty more depth? idk this is a weird decision for a gif
amend that to roughly $3 and you're probably a bit closer. i learned a long time ago that people care less about this stuff in the future than you'd think
looking a second time at this gif, i have to agree with you. focused cup and blurred out background. carefully placed plant to give you a good contrast (red cup on green-white background). cup rightly turned so you can clearly see the logo and the message in all caps "get free".
i don't know. when your camera focuses on something in the foreground, doesn't the background naturally go blurry? i agree about the plant, unless someone brought it into an office bathroom or something.
that's normally how cameras work. the lower your aperture (larger opening) the shorter your field of focus will be. anything outside of that field will blur, or is technically known as 'bokeh'. some phones are capable of this on some level now. i'm not familiar enough to know if they're managing to do it with hardware or software, but knowing how it works for my dslr it's likely a software thing. by comparison my dslr can get an even narrower field of focus using the right lenses... and i'm not even using something professional to do it. on plants, could just be near a sink... since you know, this would make a huge disgusting mess if you didn't use a sink. i'm all for pointing out factual evidence that someone is pretending to be your average redditor when they are in fact a massive corporation, but saying bokeh means they're a shill is a bit of a farce for me.
i bet if you drink dog shit, you'll have shitty breath. if you don't drink dog shit, then i'll have to drink coffee tomorrow morning. i roll high stakes.
it's time for kenny blankenships most painful eliminations of the day!
reminds me of my childhood, except the balls were smaller and wrinkly and my uncle's
is there a non-slo-mo version of this? it would be funnier at real speed.
i am a horrible person. this made me happy beyond words. i kinda wish i was the guy that threw it.
kid threw a curve ball around the little girl to pull this off. incredibly impressive.
it's funny how children regardless of pain, their first reaction to something unfortunate happening in front of people is to be as overdramatic as possible.
*"i'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life but thank you all for playing with me."*
oh man...he stuck it *out* right as it hit him too...that's pain.
i hope in heaven i get to see slowed down gifs of my greatest blunders, and finest finesses.
you can tell the age of reddit is going down. all the overwatch references, top votes. old quake/unreal references..... * circkets *
regular speed and *then* slo-mo shoukd be the standard.
that guy has the worst reactions imaginable. it's like his subconscious reflexes are trying to harm him.
i like subs like this. nobody ends up dead. its great.
as a guy that really put his ass on the line for the team this kind of irritates me seeing how performances like this are ridiculed instead of admired.
a compilation video with a wicked backing track and the right parts put into slow-mo.
you say that, but there's a lot of old farts like me that play overwatch because there's plenty of characters that don't rely on precise twitchy hitscanning.
quake is an m-rated game released in 1996. you have to have been born in 1979 or earlier to have played that game at the recommended age, making you 38 or older right now. reddit's average person was never *that* old.
i feel like until the last year or two this was always standard procedure in video clips...then all of a sudden everything changed. i'm thinking slow mo just became more accessible to the average idiot uploader.
i just look at him and say, "ok?" as long as he replies with "ok", i'm good. he's 2.
without googling anything i'm gonna go ahead and ask. where? spike website or something?
it's like he was evolutionarily programmed to die.
i think it's impressive that he keeps getting up and doing his best to defend the goal. he shrugs off that first kick like nothing and is ready to take a second and possibly a third if need be. that's dedication. i also think it's hilarious that he got hit twice in the face. it in no way means he's a bad player, but come on... that's just funny.
that comment is practically /r/aww material compared to some of the shit on here.
when shooting slo mo, a lot of phones *only* shoot in slow motion. so there's never a regular speed version to upload. the rise of slow motion mobile cameras is why more and more times now, you only see the slow motion version. before, if someone wanted slo mo, they'd slow the video down manually. it's just that no one ever thinks to *speed* their slow motion videos *up* manually
karma whoring is basically his job, so he might as well.
funniest thing i ever did was ad jungle veigar. ended up losing but not because of me, i actually pulled off everything a good jungle was supposed to be doing. enemy team was laughing so hard that our best player was ad veigar.
this is like laughter crack. idk why it's so funny. it shouldn't be that funny but it freaking cracks me up.
dagobah, jolly rancher, cum box, and so many more of the greats.
same for you, lol i see you x-posted this to /r/wastedgifs :)
i can look later tonight once i'm not longer at work but there is actually a website that streams it 24/7 that i watch all the time, better quality and no need to click around. i found it in a different thread about mxc a few months ago.
what were dagobah and jolly rancher? i know cum box but not the others
don't ask questions you don't really wanna know the answer to.
in the netherlands they're closing prisons because there are not enough prisoners
holy shit!! i know him! i babysat his kids in ny until he moved up to vt! damn, never thought i would see him on reddit! you got a good police chief there, i will tell you that!
people need to stop posting pictures of themselves holding a sign on the internet. by the end of the day, his text will be replaced with "would make an excellent setting for a gay porn franchise"
yeah, this might actually be happening in the netherlands, here in usa we have private prisons fighting to keep cannabis illegal, bribing judges, basically doing the opposite of this.
bit of a long story to get to my point. last year i took a tour of the eastern state penitentiary. it was one of the first prisons in the us that was used for long term prison sentences. it was an audio tour (narrated by steve bushemi) and i leaned a few things. penitentiaries are named so because the inmates were serving a penance; kept in silent contemplation of their sins. before this time, prisons were merely holding cells used until a trial occurred or sentence was rendered. the sentences were simple to carry out: death, stockade, ear nailing, shipping, etc. i have to say, there is something too be said for a quick punishment: criminals aren't institutionalized, cost is lower, etc.
fellow burlingtonian checking in, things like this make me proud to live here. that and seeing bernie walking around in street clothes to catch a meeting by himself, national celebrity be damned.
so if one wanted to move to the us ( in this day and age!? are you mad man!? ikr), vermont seems like the best bet, eh?
if would help if private companies weren't allowed to run prisions
this is a reassuring sentiment. happy to see there (might? maybe?) be a trend recently against private prisons here in the us.
fellow burlingtonian here. chief del pozo is legit. i'm no police sympathizer, but everything i read and hear about this guy is fantastic. he seems very intelligent, with a fantastic sense of morals and values, and a vision for what policing and criminal justice should look like in the 21st century. we are lucky to have this man leading our fantastic police force.
on the enforcement side, officers need to see themselves as "peace officers" first and foremost. no serious crime? help old ladies cross the street. help people change their tires. that stuff isn't beneath you or a waste of time - that's the highest form of your job!
watch 13th. this won't happen in the u.s. we make money off of small petty crimes and make it virtually impossible for people to be successful citizens outside of prison time, regardless if they fix their behaviors or not. greed is a hell of a drug.
well he's probably one of the good ones, but sadly he's not the norm. i doubt for example the burlington pd have a quota system, but a ton of places do. &nbsp; 50 bucks says fox will never interview him on o'reilly or the kelly file, and instead will get some authoritarian like sherrif david clarke on once a week to tell us how "comply or die, tolerate the nsa, and don't dissent" is the "new american way", but still, good for this guy in the pic. hopefully he's teaching criminology classes when he retires
in order to do that, we have to start viewing prisons as rehabilitation instead of punishment.
and renting out prisons to norway. norwegian prisoners are sent to the netherlands, because there are no vacancies in our prisons.
*and they're drowning in crime! it's the end of the world! rape and murder on every corn--* what's that? everything's fine? the violent crime rate is actually *lower* than the us?
burlington police are pretty damn legit. gave me plenty of noise violations but they were always warranted. vt also came so close to being the only state where police didn't kill anyone last year, then they shot a drug dealer in december.
do you usually think you'll see a specific person you know on reddit?
crumple the piece of paper. can't photoshop all the intricate shadows.
but don't you dare say a word against it, or you're "soft on crime".
could you elaborate on what's happening in the netherlands?
i forget where i read it but apparently steve buscemi volunteered with the new york fire department after 9/11!
i'm going to be in burlington next month! i'm so excited! my best friend has lived there since 2004 and i lived there for the summer of 2007. haven't been since 2012. i can't wait!
i think this is one of those **shoot for the stars** scenarios. i doubt he wants prisons to create a concrete plan in which they all shut down by the year 2056 or some such. he's advocating for a change in the way you view prisons and their purpose. he's advocating that prisons should aim to give inmates the help and life skills that increase their chances of rehabilitating once they're out. prisons should help their inmates meet 'early release for good behaviour' requirements. should advocate for parole where possible/reasonable. a privately run prison (basically any american prison) that gets paid per inmate is going to the do the exact opposite. they profit from repeat offenders and have no incentive to rehabilitate or parole prisoners.
fortunately, that stuff happens way more than you would think. unfortunately, that stuff never makes the news. only the 1 in 10,000 officers that abuses their power makes the headlines and people assume that is the norm.
fox would put him on o'reilly's show and just beat the piss out of him. "there's going to be criminals and you don't want to jail them! this. is. a. police. chief. in. america. people. "
can anyone explain to me the logic behind the police having a quota to fill? is this not creating crime or at least expanding it? that seems wrong
this idea that most police cheifs are bad is such bullshit. the minority of bad cops need to be handled but the vast majority are professional.
yeah, that'd be nice, remember the backlash when obama tries to allow felons to disclose their status during the interview instead of before it, or when we made it so felons could never vote ever again for the rest of their lives?
isn't this basically the start of the plot of johnny english?
i was skeptical until stoopwafel, those are the delicious little toffeeish cinnimonyish disks right?
hmmmmm.. ...... ... ... ... .. . so. can we start exporting our criminals over there?
so the dutch should build a wall to keep out norwegians because they're only sending their worst, their murderers and rapists... i mean, i'm sure their are some nice norwegians, but not those that are coming over. and i bet norway is paying to send them over as well. til netherlands/norway is really the european us/mexico
something... wouldn't work in america because... something... homogenious population... taxes... socialism... rabble rabble rabble
you're challenging redditors, never challenge redditors
you can. just make the whole paper white in photoshop and put the text over that. it doesn't have to be good to fool most people.
so then agree and calmly explain that you should be soft on non violent criminals because throwing them in prison does absolutely nothing for them just make sure you express both non violent, and that they still severely need help
i'm not sure him saying it's idealistic means he thinks it's impossible. just that it doesn't matter if it is possible - it's still the direction they should head towards
basically we didn't have enough prisoners to put in the cells so we started renting them out to other countries (e.g. the danish and belgians sent their prisoners to stay in our prisons) but that wasn't enough either, so instead the government decided to just close a bunch of prisons instead.
but do go for halloween, because dang is their haunted house game strong.
good luck trying to get heady topper if that's on your list of things to do.
1 in 10,000 huh? i'd love to read that source, but let's not pretend that every act of abuse is plastered in the media. additionally, i'm sure the other 9,999 were busy hiding behind a billboard with a radar gun, as oppossed to making a visible presence to deter speeding.
its not about individuals being good or bad. its about a system which rewards loyalty over what is right and shields its members from the "justice" it imposes on the public. a good person can and often will behave "badly" in this type of system and a bad person will behave worse.
if bad cops aren't being handled then by literal definition their police chiefs are bad. it is literally their job.
just had some, they're delicious. i don't know about the cinnamonish thing, you must be looking for something else. it's basically cookie + caramel + cookie. source: am dutch. jodenkoek.
(i am aware that you're joking.) well... the norwegian criminals have been crowded out by foreigners. the prisons were sufficient to deal with homegrown baddies, but in the last 10 or so years foreigners have really stepped up. so norwegian criminals are shipped to the netherlands to make room for lithuanian burglars.
"fundamentally, states have totally different types of barbeque and pizza, so they're like way more different than any two european countries like france or australia. it just wouldn't work because we guarantee free speech which no other country in the whole milky way does, and plus we don't have the money to spend on things like rehabilitation because we're the world police and ensure every other country on earth is safe from terror, so basically we're like the country equivalent of jesus, except our sacrifice is greater"
i found the secret ingredient to peace its maple syrup.
oh shit i know the dude! i saw him on the front page earlier today. what a coincidence
well i bet redditors can't build a fusion reactor... /hope
this. if you can't put people in prison and make millions out of harmless criminals with things like a medical issue with marijuana, what else can you do?
growing up in the hood i feel 50/50. on one hand i have all my friends either overdosed, in jail for heroin trafficking, or too fucked up from the drugs. and on the other i have the same people who are ruthless criminals that will steal whatever is not bolted down or purpose target those trying to stay away from drugs. i love these people but i'm sorry to say they need tough love. i kind of wish instead of locking my friends up police would crack them over the head with their baton every time they were being scumbags.
this is basically what cost democrats the white house over and over until they wised up and bill clinton ran as "tough on crime" (and was, vastly expanding the programs responsible for police militarization in the name of the war on drugs). however good rational approaches to crime are, they are absolutely toxic for politicians. it's just too easy to trot out murderers and rapists and be like "tommy democrat wants these guys walking around freeeee! eooooooooooooo!"
oh wow. that's a good thing right? unless the reason behind it is that crimes go un(der)punished
i've heard! one year for sure, and philadelphia is close enough to make an overnight trip out of it.
it's always on my list. it's usually not hard to find in burlington though. did something happen?
the majority of bad cops are handled. the minority that aren't would be the result of bad police chiefs, like you said.
isn't it the other way around? in selecting who's sent to the netherlands, they choose the ones that has no family or other close contacts in norway that would help their stay in prison. so norwegian prisoners with family and friends in norway will no be sent. it is rather the lithuanian burglars without any family that get sent to the netherlands.
seriously though, maple syrup makes you eat pancakes, and who's going to go risk their life in for power and glory after eating pancakes?
they likely have quite a few pelletiers, tremblays, roys and gagnons so it should be part of canada along with minnesota and pre-election michigan.
hey i know it might sound crazy, but to you this would just be a random naked woman.
i bet redditors can't get a girlfriend. who isn't my mom.
/u/underdog_rox said "vote" but i'll amend that to say "specifically vote *in local elections.*" the ones where you have the greatest chance to effect change. actually take the time to read about or even call individual candidates and see what they want to do and how they plan to do it. get involved with your local precinct by calling and recognizing when you see things you like and when you see things you don't. i just called two months ago cuz i saw a rare bicycle cop cruising in my downtown. i told the chief i liked that and would love to see more foot and bicycle police cruising and chatting. if you're really ambitious, you can actually get involved with city politics, up to and including running for office. homegrown mayors of smallish cities is very much still a thing. no law degree or wounded cop resume needed.
we can't, without major constitutional reform. the founding fathers made it difficult to pass/change legislation because they wanted each law to be carefully deliberated, but back then they were dealing with 13 coastal states and a relatively homogeneous electorate of anglo-saxon landowners. today, america is extremely divided and won't change anything unless there is a dire need to change it immediately.
those type of people need some real help/rehabilitation. throwing them in a jail cell for a while and kicking them back out on the streets with nothing gained or learned isn't going to improve anyone.
a politician is only as good as the electorate. you need a rigourous, thorough and varied education system to run the ticket of "i'm doing these emotionally unsatisfying policies because they get objective results that are good for everyone." and actually win. voting is a skill.
hurricane irene flooded out the alchemist (the brewery that makes heady topper). they didn't have much space for a few years. good news though! this summer they opened their new brewery and it's wicked easy to get here
it's easy, it's just about timing. find the drop off schedule online. or if you just want to drink some and not take it home, go to one of the many bars downtown and it's usually available.
"handled" meaning quietly fired or shuffled around without consequences.
i don't think there's a specific johnny english themed subreddit. shame though.
well you can't save everyone but you can certainly try. also very important is what you do with them after they are released.
had a look, and, apparently, yes. mostly. according to the prison service, as of a little over one year ago, 193 prisoners were transferred or in the process. 26 of these were norwegian. 20 of the norwegian prisoners objected to the transfer. so, fortunately, it's mostly foreigners, who should presumably not be any less at home in the netherlands than in norway. but it's gotta suck to be a norwegian prisoner and get shipped off against your will when prison capacity has unquestionably been busted due to "tourists".
if it's in the eurovision song contest it's good enough for us!
i'm a 9th generation vermonter and am roughly 75% french canadian. can confirm, we're basically quebec lite (except we know how to drive and we aren't assholes (usually))
to be fair, minnesota has a lot more lingaards and olsons than french heritage names.
sadly, i fear we are in aforementioned "dire situation". we have been slowly conditioned to accept this but if you take a step back and look: we are truly in a bad place as a nation.
well, vote for the people without an interest in keeping prisons the way they are
exactly. and some people even make more gang connections in prison than they would have if they were placed in some sort of rehab program.
so certain political organisations would benefit from communities receiving poor education is the flip side of that right?
no, that notion of yours would fall again under the misconception the /u/gronkalicious was telling you was bullshit. when an officer gets canned for abusing their authority or shady ongoings, you can be sure most departments make sure they let their citizens know loud and proud that they don't tolerate that behavior.
we are both our own continent, in europe via eurovision, in asia via the asian cup and antartica via our territory there. 4 continents in one.
both the baby and mom not giving a fuck is perfect.
we have 5% of the world's population, 25% of the worlds imprisoned population.
hey vote for me, i'm the right person, plus i'm endorsed by your party, and in addition i'm **tough on crime**. people get elected based off of those last 3 words, it's fucking ridiculous.
most can't actually. there are employee privacy laws that restrict what an employer can say about you in most states unless there is a public proceeding associated with it or the individual consents.
i think you meant send them back to the under-funded, deteriorating, forgotten hell-hole that they probably came from and then send them back to prison. the american way seems to think that access to good education, decent housing, community building programs, and the criminal justice/prison system are all separate problems when indeed they are one conglomerate problem.
and you're the most important/infuriating territory in risk. you have it all.
who the hell gets out of a car like that....and then starts towards a cop like that? he should consider himself lucky he only got tazed. holy stupid...
woah woah woah! not so fast! if the sub doesn't exist, you make it exist! that's always the solution!!
you forgot them not being able to find meaningful employment ever again as well.
i communicate with my small human with a series of whistles and clicks.
the smile at the end. it truly is all about the little things. (missing my kid that went away to college last week.)
hey, that's how i check to see if my teenager is still alive!!! crack the door open, hold up a fry and when she grabs it, i know not to call 911.
that little paw coming up and snatching the veggie straw is dreadfully cute. quick story: my wife, then-3 year old son, and i were on a road trip. i gave my wife a slim jim and our son asked for some. i nipped off a piece and handed it back to him. a moment later, i see his little hand extended with the piece in it and hear him say in his adorable toddler voice, "it's too.... hot."
i was expecting baby mouth, but that was just as cute.
i think this might be the cutest thing i've seen all year
just like a little yoda and you are luke training on dagobah
i don't buy the baby story. that's her parasitic twin growing out the back of her neck.
this should be posted in r/aww. both the baby's hand and you, giggling, are adorable.
i've never seen a post with this many upvotes. but damn it if this gif isn't worth it!
i once dated an african lady who didn't speak english. we just clicked.
man your kid must be real smart. i've never seen a baby in my class.
i feel for you. when my daughter left for foreign exchange school in bolivia i cried so hard after dropping her off that the sky cap man came over and hold my hand. he kept saying, "it will be alright." he'd been seeing kids leave home all week.
if it makes you feel any better, going away to college made me really realize how much i loved my parents. we had some rough times in the prior years, but since i've always loved the time that i spent at home with them.
another trick is to text "pizza" and if your teen immediately appears downstairs, he or she is alive. prepare for fallout if you don't actually have pizza.
that reminds me of when a baby eats a lemon for the first time and they don't expect the sensation.
i'm a nanny and one time the 4 year old girl got a yeast infection. she said, "my bagina feels spicy."
i gave my friend's 2 year old some pop rocks in the hope that it would be funny but she barely even made a face! i was expecting the lemon face but she actually liked them and didn't seem surprised by the popping sensation.
why do babies love these things so much? i honestly think they're gross but both of my nephews devour them.
one day there'll be a post where it's a chick and one of the top comments isn't something about her appearance
wonder how many people didn't get the joke and just up voted because they thought it was a cute story about people getting past barriers

i actually had a baby in my numerical analysis class. he used to bring his mom everywhere, such a nerd.
every time i hear things like this i realize how fucked up my parental relationship was. i never missed my family for a second and am very happy to be away.
i hear babies' tastebuds are extremely sensitive. it's why baby food is so bland and tasteless. so a lemon is like, holy shit fuck my face is going to shrivel up into itself and implode level bad.
perfect, now someone change the veggie fry to an upvote.
even more impressive when you realize how fucking quick that dude is punching, too
oh, one of my professors used to bring her baby in class quite a few times. he was a good baby.
y'know, i did not have high hopes for a link from someone called /u/snotbag_pukebucket, but you've really shown me wrong. thanks, snot.
i struggled with this. what's the man that carries your luggage?
yea, going to college made me realize how toxic my parents are.
really you don't find the following amusing? *forehead? more like five-head! can't tell if boy or girl! (also, /r/swordorsheath) if dude, you are probably a virgin who would be delighted if his mother would make herself available for him. if woman, you have daddy issues and your dad/uncle/grandpa/etc has had their way with you.*
oh... i think my kid is broken. she loves spicy things... lemons, dill pickles (with extra garlic), etc.
it's reddit tradition for the comment explaining the joke to get twice as many upvotes at the joke itself. for a website whose users like using the term "whoosh" so much, people here aren't very good at detecting humor / sarcasm unless it's slammed in their face.
to be fair, i really do think it's the best thing i've seen so far this year. mom's expression is heartwarming
*downvote the face at the end is just begging for it
mine did too. we even got to play with them, which was quite fun and a nice relaxing way to take a break from studying and class.
*if you are such an attractive woman that i can find no fault with your appearance, you surely are employed in the sex industry and frequently perform fellatio.*
i have twins and we always feed them dinner before us, but we know they'll end up wanting to eat our food as well. i thought i was slick by putting hot sauce on my food so they didn't want it. turns out my son is just a vacuum and loves hot sauce. his sister tolerates it but doesn't love it like him. if i'm eating hot wings he'll usually eat a few wings worth of meat covered in frank's by himself. he's only 20 months and is in the top percentile for height and head size. he's literally going to eat me out of house and home when he's a teenager in puberty.
my kid had her first bite of a dill and a lemon when she was 8 months. her face was priceless but now she absolutely loves pickles and somewhat tolerates lemon
upvotes are used as "i already knew that" buttons.
viola is alright but i think the cello is better.
this is precisely why i do not wish to speak line.
you should make sure that he learns how to cook. he might eat you out of house, might as well make it a delicious ride!
i'm calling morse code 'line' from now on. your delivery had me chuckling.
of course i used a translator, what am i? some kind of freakin' nerd???
it was here on reddit. then the son of the professor showed up and we learned that the professor is also a bodybuilder.
the reason it calms babies instantly is because this way of holding them restricts their ability to breathe normally. it should only be used by trained personnel. it is not advised to use it "just to quiet the baby". most of the time crying means there is something wrong and shouldn't be ignored/stopped like that.
ya know who used morse code? that's right the god damn military...but probably it was the nerds using the radios...shit...here's my lunch money
what's the son have to with with the professor being a body builder?
i'm going to donate your lunch money to morsecode.io, because looks like their hosting bill has got the better of them. what if you're the last person that ever got the chance to nerdbeeps?
i feel like my kitten is like this to my 14 year old cat. she's so small she has to practically jump or pounce to get on him. it's either going to be to attack or to lick the back of his head. he never knows which the kitten will do so he tolerates and let's her control the situation but you can tell he's still on guard.
yeah. my gf slaps me across the face before she kisses me, too.
i have a gsd and a cat. can confirm. they are either mortal enemies or best friends. and the pendulum can swing very fast!
correct me if i'm wrong, but i remember hearing somewhere when a cat licks the top of another cat's head (or in this case a dog's) it is showing a sign of dominance, as if to say it's in control or it's the leader. so (if i'm not mistaken) this would be the cat reminding the dog who's in charge.
dog - i just want to play! cat - i don't believe you. fuck off! dog - look! see, i can lie down like a good dog! cat - you're...kinda cute i guess. *inch closer* ... *inch closer, swat!* dog - not the face!! cat - oo okay, you're cute. *lick lick* dog - :d
the cat was just helping him get that piece of food of his face.
somehow i feel like a lick in the world of cats isn't a kiss but something more nefarious like 'let me see if you are tasty enough to eat'.
my sisters each have a dog. they are about the same age, but one is 40lbs and the other is 11lbs. the little one thinks he's the big boss. he will attack the larger one and she will dramatically fall over as if he knocked her down.
yup. my ex had 2 cats (bro and sis) and a german. the german and the male cat got along great, but not the female cat. however the male cat would switch sides multiple times a day. hilarious to watch.
sounds about right. my cat licks the top of my head all the time.
idk, cat's also lick each other as a "lets be friends" move. the cat is visibly annoyed but also doesn't use it's claws when it smacks the dogs face my guess is the cat doesn't understand the dog is playing and the dog doesn't understand that the cat isn't playing so when the dog lies down the cat is like "we don't have to be mean to each other"
i've seen them do it to each other simultaneously.
i was waiting for some type of behavioral explaination. this seems good to me.
but i'm also pretty sure that, in the dog world, licking around the face/mouth is a submissive act. so essentially, the cat showed it's dominance while the dog thought that it was being submissive. a proper stalemate.
so i should stop letting my cats lick my hair? maybe i'll start licking their heads and see what happens.
nah, it's affection.. cats don't show dominance that way.
i mean, humans reward dogs who listen. this car is probably doing the same.
"i've put in my recommendation with my servants. they may keep you"
dogs play with mock/simulated aggression as well. but as anyone with cats can tell you, mock aggression becomes real very, very quickly when one of them takes exception to how the other one is playing.
but if dogs play like this as well how do they not understand the behavior?
giant teeth, huge claws, predatory eyes... imma touch it. steve gibbon.
he's risking death just to smack a kitty. i'm seriously wondering what would happen if they caught him. would they kill him?
did they add comic style punching noises in this nature doc?
my parents' pug beats up their bernese mountain dog. the pug is the size of a large cat, weighs about 7kg. the bernese mountain dog is 6ft tall when he stands on his hind legs, and weighs 55kg. the pug goes full on bezerk mode and has declared himself biggest dog. when the berner gets tired of his shit, he just sits on the pug.
so, i should lick my cat's head to assert dominance?
no, they're both exhibiting play behavior. cats flip their tails like that when they're entertained. the licking is the end game, it's how the cat has won. you can see how the cat's objective the whole time is to get closer to the dog. think of the game where you put your hands in someone else's and then try to pull your hands away at the same time that they're trying to slap your hands. every time the cat gets closer without triggering the dog to respond he's won a round of it. but the dog doesn't realize that the lick at the end is the point of the game to the cat, she's trying to entice the cat into a more robust wrestly chasey game like dogs play.
before they do that, though, they do the "bow", where they lower their chest down and spread their front legs apart. that tells the other dog "whatever is next is me playing with you"
dogs have a very distinct posture right before they want to play, where they'll flatten their front half against the ground, and they'll tap you and then run away, and then run back and tap you like they're teasing you. whereas cats will just hit you over and over again.
there are some crossed signals in terms of body language though dog tail wagging - excited! cat tail switching - angry! dog exposes stomach - submissive! cat exposes stomach - touch me, i fucking dare you! and so on
cats play to win. dogs play to have fun. dogs are "fuckin casuals".
the way cats and dogs show excitement and playfulness is diffrent. we know dogs wag their tails, bow and bark and breath rapidly. cats on the otherhand gets a stiffer posture. the tail will be straight up. the ears as well. cats like making contact by rubbing their body against you or the playmate.
when a dog flips on its back and exposes its belly, it's a sign of submission. when a cat flips on its back and exposes its belly, it's a sign of fucking war. when a dog wags its tail, it's a sign of excitement. when a cat switches its tail, it's a sign of anger. also dogs seem relatively immune to size differences whereas cats seem very conscious of it. so your 100 pound dog will shove its gigantic head right at your 9 pound cat to show friendliness and the cat freaks the fuck out.
yes! and one of the few videos where it enhances rather than distracts, just the right amount without going overboard
my older dog, 4 years, about 20 punds, got to my pup when she was smaller than her and taught her who the head honcho was
kudos to your parents for them pushing the bernese to be nice. too many people don't and figure the little dog will learn a lesson when the big dog flips out. rarely have i ever heard of the little dog not ending up injured. :(
if you try it, please record it and post the aftermath on here. i have a feeling like your cat would challenge your attempt at dominance with a quick smack to the face. i know my place in my house, and it's not above my cat :(
i never noticed until this comment, but that's how i played with me dog. i'd flatten myself down and imitate her posture. then her tongue would come out even more and she'd look happy. then swap a few slaps to the hands. she'd swat back. then surprise chase! stop, repeat.
i adopted a dog who had no clue what a play bow was. took her so long to figure it out, almost a full year.
cats also have physical traits associated with playing or being ok. ears up, relaxed body, absence of hissing, etc..
they're the console gamers, whilst the cats are members of the pcmr
i wouldn't say that now, it didn't take long to realize "wait, what's with the cartoony sound effects?" unless this was originally for a kids' show or something, i don't see why they felt the need to add that; a monkey smacking around some tigers is engaging enough.
the real answer is that all dogs should behave like that, not just big dogs. my parents 95lb lab mix dog was used for training fighting dogs when she was a puppy and the only dogs she gets along with are well behaved dogs. she gets along with 90% of big dogs and probably only 20% of little dogs. the problem is training. the little dogs shouldn't just be looked at as if they're cute and don't need to behave.
did someone really make...is this a real...? did i just see...cat tongue being...? does it...? redditor.exe is broken.
really? i am the mum of my cats, i can scold them, i can hold them down and groom them. and they are very loving and content, it's just that they don't resist (very much) when i have to clip their nails or whatever (to be fair: pills, they *massively* resist - but even so they don't harm me. they just wiggle a lot, clamp jaws shut, fake-swallow and spit the pill out...) my cats have only ever hurt me when playing went too far (and then i corrected them) or when extremely upset and afraid, which happens very very rarely. they don't deliberately hurt me, they would never dare. but they're not timid abused flowers or something, they climb all over me, steal my stuff - they just know the line
my cat would get a smack back.... my cat knows just how far she can push me, and she doesn't go any farther. she knows i won't put up with it. doesn't stop her from climbing into my lap when i'm home, not does it stop me from cuddling the shit out of her.. but if she goes into bitch mode? i'm the bigger one...
then try to look right over there to your right at no. 10 :) it's a pretty ridiculous rule. it's not like the page is going to open itself. the link still has to be clicked on by the user who makes a conscious choice to do so. but, no, let's just have a rule that takes away that choice from everyone, and that'll be the end of that make-believe, blown-up problem.
except if you have a dachshund that insists on a formal play request. if you do, and skip the play bow, she will bite you. my other dog knows this from lots of experience.
the cat washes the dog because their relationship isn't at that "unspoken play" point yet. the licking is the cat's version of a bow. "oh! oh! haha, nah, i'm just fuckin' with you, much larger lumberbeast. you're cool."
yeah it's different with every dog. my daschund/heeler mix will just run up and bite a dog on its ass to initiate playtime. most dogs understand and start playing right away. in fact i don't remember any dogs reacting poorly. they sneeze a lot to indicate that they're not being aggressive.
please don't get me wrong, my cat is very comfortable being handled and is generally a big cuddle bug. i just think that if i try to actually lick her, that might change
i don't know when it will ever *not* be too soon for that one. it was *so* incredibly heartbreaking! ;_;
my understanding is that, to cats, the one doing the grooming is the dominant one.
blame bran for that one. three eyes raven told him to keep off the tree!
game of thrones. if you're not caught up with season 6 then you really shouldn't know. it's a pretty big spoiler.
i have two males, and they will both start taking turns grooming each other, but they both get more aggressive as they go, fighting over who grooms who, and it always ends in a wrestling match.
ahh, could never get into game of thrones, unfortunately. i tried, but just couldn't. thanks, though!
man if i could give a picture of myself to people for christmas i would save sooo much money.
i didn't think you could snail mail karma, but i'll be damned, here it is.
you should totally take a picture of you wearing the shirt, make a shirt of that, and send it to him.
that's awesome! i missed out on it this year. soooo gonna take part next for sure.
ggg /u/vernetroyer knows his stuff, what an awesome gift, even comes with an instant karma pack !
not sure if the gift was the t-shirt.....or the front page/karma...
sweet, glad your secret santa delivered. i know a lot of people got .....shorted.
he is awesome. seems to have a great sense of humor. but holy shit does that guy get white girl wasted. i saw him on some celebrity reality show a while back and i'm pretty sure he crashed his scooter into a wall and pissed in a house plant
anybody know if whoever got snoop or bill gates will go public with what they got?
seems a bit against the spirit, honestly. i've done secret santa on numerous accounts half the experience is gifting based on interests and post history. this would've been sent to anyone regardless of who was matched with verne. theres no gifting, really. just publicity.
that is awesome how do you sign up for secret santa?
vern is a god damned prophet! 8k upvotes and counting. bet he didn't think you'd make it to #1 on all of reddit though.
my dad was like a textbook narcissist. he gave my brother, who he abandoned at birth, an autographed picture of him for his birthday. it was so fucked up. i still laugh about it to this day.
i was thinking the same thing! i can make people insanely happy just by sending them a pic and signature.
i would have loved mad up-votes. my secret santa flaked on me this year and it was my first year doing it. /:
i didn't think you could snail mail karma, but i'll be damned, here it is.
or even better, send it to whoever gets you as their secret santa next year and tell them to continue the trend. in 30 years it'll be one hell of a shirt!
i honestly thought i was going to get dog shit because of all the horror stories, but after the excitement of getting this, i'm doing it next year for sure!
at least you didn't get all excited after mailing yours and waiting for the yes i would have mouthed when mine was shipped. but no this year my secret santa gave me disappointment and a sense of unfairness in the world.
be careful...i was really excited about participating this year...got my gift sent out the first day and i was really excited...my giftee never acknowledged my gift and my santa never sent me a gift... looking at the stats they provide it appears 27.4% of people that signed up have a santa that didnt ship their gift by the deadline and only 18.5% of people who shipped out their gifts have received a response in the gallery...i guess i'm just sad :(
/u/vernetroyer please come and be recognized with upvotes. you're overdue in centuryclub.
they don't even do the ama nowadays! that's what pisses me off. not that i don't like victoria, but when i read "victoria's helping me out with this ama today by phone", it's just not the same, and i'm instantly turned off from the ama. i know it's an exact transcription, but i just prefer the celebrity to actually type it out and click submit on the comment. it's more personal, more real, less "just another publicity stunt" to me.
snoop dog is better about this than any other celebrity i can think of, if you check out his profile (/u/here_comes_the_king) he regularly comments, mainly at /r/trees and usually doesn't even bring up who he is
honestly i love the tshirt and picture, the karma was unexpected but amazing to say the least
grandparents, mothers, etc love that kind of thing.
you are an idol in my book, have a merry christmas and a happy freaking new year p.s. your role in austin powers made that movie one of my favorites, keep on doing what you're doing man!
the upside is that next year, they will match you with someone who didn't flake out on their last match. i really like getting matched with someone who got shafted the year before because i feel like i'm putting an extra big smile on their face. hope next year is better for you.
it doesn't really work this one. it's split a bit strangely. still, good bot.
but, after this, you will be disappointed next year! better stop when you're at the top!
over the course of this next year, definitely do enough exchanges so that next year you can join us for plus plus, and be a part of those people that know how to not be dickbags.
hopefully, you'll get rematched with someone awesome. if not, let me know, and i'll send ya a gift.
i liked him better in charlie and the chocolate factory
he should upgrade his username to /u/vernedestroyer
i don't think he qualifies. isn't it 100,000 link karma *or* 100,000 comment karma?
iitemp3stii is my idol too, truly an inspiration. favorite quote from him has to be the time he said "he sure did get them" in that thread a few minutes ago.
really? i got flaked on last year, signed up for re gifting and got flaked on again. didn't sign up this year cuz of that bad experience. would have if i had known this. d:
what sucks is that my santa has been pulling my info, and even did today at 10:33am. hoping he still comes through.
i didn't do it this year, but after seeing all this, i can't wait until next christmas!
exchanges over reddit as a whole,or just from secret santa? i didn't get to apply this year,so now i'm pretty interested in doing gift exchanges!
for being lostanddelirious you got a good soul on ya. that's really kind of you. but i couldn't ask something like that it's too generous. edit autocorrect
i preferred his performance as an ewok in star trek
it took about five minutes for someone to make that account.
i thought it might have gotten maybe 100 and then passed by, never front page with 5000+
too bad the vote fuzzing hit it harsh. it was at 11600 about a half hour ago, and now it's at 6500.
nice shortcut using 9.3k. typing 9,300 always grinds my gears.
if you order through redditgifts, sometimes stuff doesn't ship for a few days, so give it some time. i ordered a gift for my match on tuesday and it didn't ship until today.
let me know if you send him a gift if he sends him a gift and i will get you one.
i liked him as yoda in harry potter. "levio*sa* it is not, levi*o*sa it is"
omg the guy from fantasy island looks so young! he must work out!
wait till you see how much karma i get from reposting it.
i can't tell if you are being serious. ambiguous sarcasm is the best kind of sarcasm.
hah! you're either going to love or hate it. in the bio, the guy said he wanted to learn salsa dancing, so i went onto amazon and found the most amazing, over-the-top "learn to salsa dance" videos and sent him those. i thought if you want to learn how to salsa dance, you might as well learn it from a woman in a skin-tight sequined bright-red ruffle-hemmed flamenco dress and a guy dressed as a matador. it cost about $30.
let me know if you send him one and i will get you one!
he was also pretty good as dobby the house elf in the hunger games
ever thought you just have a vagina that is super huge ?
jesus christ, i didn't know if it would actually finish, or stop riiiight before it completed the snake.
not just cnn, a whole slew of media the hill, buzzfeed, daily mail, nyt, politico, plus a few more as well. all barred.
it wasn't just cnn. it was also nyt, bbc, politico, la times and buzzfeed.
that "enemy of the people" shit near the bottom scares the fuck out of me.
i firmly believe that democratically elected leaders should have no say in which questions they answer and which ones they ignore - they answer to *the people*, and should behave accordingly. when the press asks politicians questions, it's pretty much like a health inspector questioning a restaurant owner, or a boss asking an employee "okay, what is going on here and what should i know"; if the matters discussed are not classified or confidential, politicians should answer, by default, anything that their employers - the electorate - ask them. a politician saying that "yeah i'm not going to answer your question" makes my blood boil.
from what i've seen in other articles bbc was banned as well. they exclusion of multiple mainstream news sources should be a red flag to all you americans... freedom of the press is in danger here...
silencing the press is both terrifying and un-american. i hope some of the establishment republicans realize this and stand up to the executive branch
this is a dangerous precedent. sure, the wh can say it was accidental or just a rushed gaggle, but it seems a little too convenient that the only ones excluded are the ones that trump constantly derides. i'm an extremely concerned citizen right now. freedom of the press is one of our core values -- the founders believed it was paramount to a free and functioning society, which is why it is in our bill of rights.
is there a precedent for this in past administrations?
i never thought i'd see the day where it becomes difficult to focus on work or social life at times because of an unending level of dread slowly rising with everything i see in the news. i can't keep up with the insanity and have never before had to balance "being an informed citizen" with "not being depressed 24/7". oh and i'm a white male. i can't even imagine what this is like for those minority groups being actively targeted or singled out. actively removing press with a gigantic liar in office right now? i'm at a loss.
now that the gloves are off the media can finally stop being afraid of loosing access and start getting down to real investigative journalism. let the torrent of leaks and 'unnamed sources' begin. somewhere out there is the woodward of our generation.
now he (they) lost it completely. news like breitbart are still allowed to share this right wing propaganda. i hope that the voters will realise that they brought batshit crazy evil into the white house.
it's ironic that the dickwads crying about "delicate snowflakes" elected the most delicate snowflake there is.
it seems like trumps 30 day plan to destroy isis was really just a rough draft of a plan to destroy the media so that no one would ever say he is wrong about something.
cnn reporter-"what's your opinion on climate change and the push back on your policies?" trump-"that's not a friendly question. tired of these hostile people,sad!" fox reporter-"why are you such a great president and how do you do it!?" trump-"now that's real news right there, great question."
i just don't understand how anyone can defend these actions. even people who only read brietbart. how do you honestly say that it's okay for the white house to bar a news organization from a briefing? how can you say that it's acceptable to only talk to the people that agree with you?
given that every single word the administration speaks at press conferences is a lie, this will probably help cnn provide more honest reporting of the president.
so when exactly do we, as citizens, draw the line? this is getting completely insane.
i love the bbc, didn't make it about them, didn't throw it up as a martyr story. the facts were given about the story and the fact that they were barred was a footnote at the end. proper journalism.
the hill even!? jesus fuck that was about as far right as you could get without being laughed at a few years ago...
associated press and time boycotted the meeting to stand in solidarity with their press brothers and sisters. a fox news anchor defended cnn and even called out the trump administration for what they're doing. interesting times we're living in.
jesus, it's like the 'invite only' town hall meetings they're doing here in wi. don't want anybody asking tough questions, so block them from coming
"and while the new york times was kept out, conservative media organizations breitbart news, the washington times and one america news network were also allowed in."
and they allowed breitbart news, the washington times and one america news network. unbelievable.
* "heard someone say" * "everyone is saying" * "people are asking questions" he uses these weasel words all the time.
remember that the entire premise of his birther theory was a "a reliable source" in a tweet. and, just this morning, the white house reports on the fbi were all by anonymous wh sources. it's a fucking joke.
we should all be able to admit at this point that we elected a typical crazy old grandpa that just watches fox news all day and has no actual understanding of the world or how anything works.
but here's how the verbal hand-waving works: "they weren't 'real' news outlets. they were 'fake' news outlets."
so by his own definition we're heading towards dictatorship?
but he's had such a stellar record of clear transparency until now!
so can we call trump a dictator now? his words, not ours.
this, a million times. ultimately, the president answers to *the people*. not *some of the people*, not *just the people that voted for him*, all of the people.
trump also said he wants to open up libel laws so he can **sue the press for "defamation" if they report negatively on him.** this is horrifying but not surprising. please, end this now before it gets to that point. if the potus can break this precedent, he will have no trouble breaking the next one.
should be a red flag? we've been waving the holy fuck we have a fascist for president flag ever since november and jack shit is happening. the republicans have zero interest in going after trump. they don't care. they've thrown any pretense of impartiality or ethics out the window.
they really can't say it was an accident, as the article claims that white house officials stopped reporters from cnn/nyt/etc at the door and basically said "you weren't invited."
i am from germany and even i share the same feelings. i cant even imagine what it feels like to be an american right now.
yea... you're not an arab muslim. consider yourself lucky :(
same here man, same here. middle aged straight white guy and this is fucking terrifying what's going on.
i'm honestly afraid to look at how /r/the_donald is probably supporting this. it's sickening to think that there are so many people who are either so easily manipulated or genuinely hate the constitution and democracy in this country.
the people who voted for him are a lost cause. it's up to the rest of us to get our shit together now. almost half of elegible voters actually voted in the last election. we can never afford to be so lazy again.
yeah, the one bright spot here is that this isn't russia, with small, limited-reach news outlets that are easy to bully. american media is a multi-billion dollar industry with reach all across the world. if the white house goes to war with the press, it'll be a fight. and not just against intrepid reporters who can be discredited (or poisoned), but against an actual *industry*. the press still has some weight behind them. it's not perfect, but its not nothing.
yeah, some people in the uk hate the bbc but i don't get it. from what i have seen, they set the bar for (mostly) unbiased and fair journalism.
i wonder if we could convince the onion to send a reporter to the white house press pool. if all that's left is breitbart and infowars, the onion could be "the most trusted reporting from the white house."
you mean the company that has a ceo in trump's cabinet was allowed a seat?! /s (this is woefully, insultingly corrupt.)
breitbart is on the national security council... let that sink in.
fox isnt even reporting it edit what i meant was at the time fox didnt have anything on their website about the ban, now they have the line "media outlets accuse white house of blocking certain press from covering event" fucking "accuse". fox still isnt certain if they are or are not banned
same in ohio. rob portman's team looked up everyone who had requested tickets and canceled the tickets for anyone who wasn't a registered republican. i wish i had known that in advance, since i switched my registration from "unaffiliated" to "republican" this past year so that i could vote for someone other than trump to win the republican nomination.
apparently the wall street journal was also there, but has stated that they did not know that some organizations were not being invited and would not attend such gaggles in the future. ap and time actually just refused to go when they found the conditions. interesting to see how this plays out... by the end we could have just breitbart at these things (although this is very unlikely).
buzzfeed is split into two. one is primarily video and entertainment division(which is also a major source of their revenue) and the other is a news and investigative division. the latter is headed by ben smith formerly of politico.
saw one of trump's explainers, sebastian gorka, the other day saying that trump's statements about the unprecedented size of his electoral college victory weren't untrue, because he prefaced them with "i guess..." in other words, trump wasn't lying about it, he was just making it up. which apparently is ok. sadly the interviewer didn't press him on why the president can't find these things out for sure before he talks about them.
basically since this whole nightmare started, it has almost literally been onion-worthy content and saying it as fact and it scares me. i usually laugh and shake my head when someone takes the onion seriously, but what do i do when someone says onion articles as serious stances? ... that was rhetorical. i cry and eat pizza at home as the world burns down while watching disney movies in my cat onesie.
the rest of the world has clearly caught on. why can't all of america admit it?
think about it. there have been a bunch of people pissed off for the last 8 years because obama was president. the angered a lot of people, and they've been stewing over it for two terms. now these guys elected a prime example of the attitude they had about the obama presidency. a prime fucking example. an unintellectual fuck who can't put together a well thought out sentence. just a bunch of phrases to express these primal ideas with vague words and phrases like "they," "you have," "everybody's talking."
these fake media making fake quotes from fake interview. fake news. *sarcasm*
yes. and he's the spokesperson, so i'm not sure how else you spin it. this is straight from the horse's mouth.
if he doesn't get impeached in a year or two, america is going to fall into a dictatorship. lead by mother fucking donald trump of all people.
i don't think you're serious, but for all who do take the post seriously: answering these kinds of questions is like pr 101. if you don't accept the premise of a question, answer the question by negating the premise of the question. e.g. "i'd love to answer a specific question about policy, and not what you like to do on the weekends." if this kind of question stumps you--and you give a soundbite--then you deserve to be nowhere near a camerawhich is why spicer is terrible at his job .
that could backfire on him. correct me if i'm wrong but to sue for defamation wouldn't the original statements have to be verifiably false?
am i the only person waking up anxious every morning?
is fox actually reciprocating or is it just shep smith? i'm pretty sure the front page of fox news the last few months have been siding heavily with trump and company. lots of articles about how trump is targeting fake news, lots of "bias alert!" articles, and too many opinion pieces about how the liberal media is losing its mind. shep is the only voice i've heard that has actually stood up for the first amendment. and he's being vilified in fox news comment boards and people are demanding he leave the network to work for the liberal media.
can you describe what it would look like if someone was removing the first amendment?
their angle is "but obama did it!" even if that's not true.
there's been several studies on the bbcs apparent bias, what most of them find is that in any two sided issue, both sides tend to think the bbc is biased towards the other side. for instance they get almost as many complaints for having a pro-israeli bias as they do for having a pro-palestine bias. it seems everyone wants to believe the bbc is biased against them.
similar deal here in the u.s. with npr. yes, it leans left sometimes, but its reporting is most often committed first and foremost to the truth. it's also thorough, thoughtful and captivating. i'm not sure why they get this heat. maybe it's something to do with public media.
the newspapers though, ugh, don't even get me started, murdoch.
actually fox business correspondent was not allowed in.
prostitution was the allegation. she attempted to sue but i believe it was thrown out. the daily mail is utter trash; just because they attacked the wife of someone i hate, doesn't mean i'll suddenly start respecting them. in fact, quite the opposite.
it's draining the swamp!!! can't people see how amaze balls dear leader is?
they are. just saw it on cuvuto and they had their own reporter on as well as an independent one slamming this. fox's actual reporters aren't on board with this shit.
what an unprofessional asshole. i don't care how conservative you are, this is the guy you want representing you?
i'm wondering: i know that first amendment protection means "free speech" can't be met with reprisals from the government, but is the president putting his toe over the line here? nobody in the press (in this scenario) is going to jail, but the president in his official capacity is clearly insulting, marginalizing, and ultimately punishing the press.
that is not the first republican to basically say he only represents republican voters, which is flat out wrong, and is the kind of thinking that kills our democracy
i feel like they should have rebranded the serious side
there is no way to spin it. that's why i absolutely can't wait to see him try.
they'll spin it as "they weren't really news outlets", and probably "they weren't banned, they were just not invited."
i don't think for a second that trump realizes what he's doing. there's someone else pulling the strings/manipulating him. to him all this stuff seems logical.
i don't think trump is the scariest one. he a crybaby dipshit, but the people in his administration (like pence and bannon) actually have a brain. we have another bush being controlled by cheney situation.
there's a reason trump is getting glowing praise from the likes of erdogan, putin, duterte, mugabe, orban and other despots. he is exactly like them.
no. the president can't make laws by himself, when it comes to internal affairs. he only has the power to veto laws that congress passes.
oh i totally agree. my point is that this paints defenders of trump into a rhetorical corner. a) he didn't do it b) it's a totally different scenario c) even when the press though that he had, they had a similar reaction, even though he's a democrat.
god, i hate how they always deflect the blame to something else, they're so fucking slimy.
the events from 1933 to 1945 would have to have been fought before 1928. later it would have been too late. one must not wait until the fight for freedom is called treason. one mustn't wait until the snowball becomes an avalanche. one must stomp the rolling snowball. the avalanche will not be stopped konnts mir nicht verkneifen
totally agree. i love npr, i have yet to hear some seriously slanted story. they do interviews and whatnot and op ed pieces but it's presented as exactly what it is.
inaccurate fact is an oxymoron is it not? if it is inaccurate it would not be a fact.
now instead of a boring standard swamp, we get a wacky cgi shrek swamp.
if newspapers and cable-news channels are like computer-sellers (e.g. hp, dell, lenovo) then the associated press would be like manufacturer of processors (e.g intel.) they do a good chunk of the "reliable and unsexy" work which serves as an important baseline that others build upon, combine, and sell to end-users.
ap is the largest newspaper operation in the us. it runs under a nonprofit label and allows all of its members to borrow from each others content. chances are anything you read in a local paper that is of national relevance has been written by an ap reporter that wasn't locally based.
some of the morons under those comments...how do these people dress themselves in the morning?
because they're next. remember, if trump had a choice, he'd probably love having just one source of news for everyone under his control.
i have to imagine shep smith will have some choice words.
born on third base and acts like he hit a triple.
as i understand it (mostly from watching the west wing, so don't trust me too far on this), the white house invites them in, which they aren't required to do, and host these press briefings, which they also aren't required to do. which means technically they can do whatever they want. it's obviously better taste to have a good relationship with the press, and obviously better for elected officials to be seen as not psychos (which the press has some control over), and obviously better for the public and all of america to know what's going on.
at this point i'm just going to register as a republican. why not? we all should. we can give our representatives hell for not standing up for our "republican" values and we can primary trump right off "our" ballot in 2020. if they seriously think having the letter d on my registration card is what's actually important to me, they're in for a surprise.
no kidding. before i just learned about the split, if someone had cited buzzfeed as an actual source i would have had trouble taking that person seriously.
it's like if tmz had hard-hitting coverage of the rwandan genocide.
as was shown recently on last week tonight, (quoting a comedy show? stewpid librul) much of trump's base legitimately believes that all of the news outlets trump calls both "fake" and "very fake" are indeed that and refuse to even lisfen to those "lies." it is impossible to reason with them right now.
i'd say it's bannon. check the guy's speeches. he's pulling trump's strings amazingly well... he's the one who should be the target of our wrath. and if you check his speeches, where he's going next is terrifying...
our allies mourned. our enemies cheered. every single time i've asked a trump supporter about this, i've gotten the same reaction: "who cares!?"
to be fair, he could probably issue a poorly written executive order on the subject that would just be blocked a few days later.
and how again will the guns be used to prevent it?
its incredible really, they'll deride obama as being shitty and evil in one breath, and then claim trump's not bad because 'obama did it!!' in the next
trump drained the swamp only to fill it with nessy and all her unhatched egglings.
it's like the local paper dude who goes to *every* city council meeting. no one wants to do that, but god damn i'm glad somebody does
it's not just for newspapers either. pretty much every newspaper, tv station, cable news network, radio station, news website, and university with a journalism school subscribes to the ap's services. they are the news outlets' news outlet. the authority.
oh the replies to popular tweets are worse than youtube comments. i just ignore them.
bannon does not enjoy fox. bannon wants control, not servitude or a partnership. he wants to control the media, narrative and what the narrative is. fox is merely a platform he can use for now, but eventually he wants breitbart news to be the dominant mouthpiece of the right and the neo age nazi's.
while reading trump's words verbatim, it's always tough to figure out whether this is actually what trump said, or if it's someone just meme-ing out trump-talk. his voice plays out in my head, and as a non-american, his thoughts and words sound muddled af.
if you watch "the making of trump" by pbs frontline, they interview his former classmates at his military school. his classmates described that since their world view was so limited, they relied on sources like playboy and bond to inform them of what adult life was like. the classmate interviewed goes on to say that as they graduated, most of them got out, realized that view of the world wasn't real, and grew up.....but that trump admitted to them that he is still the same 16 year old boy viewing the world through that lens.
wasn't it mulaney? that dude is genuinely hilarious.
or if mcdonalds opened a michelin starred restaurant
where is he going next in your opinion? i'm at work and don't feel like delving into bannon's brain right now...
'so this is how liberty dies ... with thunderous applause'
and this is the problem with a lot of trump supporters. they don't see the global implications of all these actions. they don't realise that what trump does in office ~~can~~ is already affecting global politics, and very much has the potential to start a wwiii if he ticks the right boxes.
every article i read from the ap is pretty much just state the facts, the people and not much else. it's like a very generic but vanilla event occurrence reporting. it doesn't have to go in depth or deep, itll let others build up and fill you in on the back story. fair and balanced just tell us what occurred today kind of news.
trump is a master at saying a lot of words but not communicating anything of substance. he speaks vaguely, has a few favorite adjectives that he uses repetitively, and repeats previous statements with different words. very easy to mimic, and can be quite humorous, but ingesting the real deal has about the same nutritious value as eating a bag of chips.
like hell i will! *throws tea in nearest body of water*
huh, i'll have to check his stuff then. i tried watching his sitcom and it was atrocious
you never know. mcdonald corporation invests in other restaurants including chipotle at one point. it is not inconceivable that they might have ownership in some fine dining establishments.
he is no master of talking and no saying anything. many politicians do and is usually hard to notice, with trump is incredibly obvious.
pour that shit right out, into the nearest harbor!
his voting base were mainly the the poor, dumb and wanna-be strong men.
all pbs frontline prgrams are available online for free, it's the magic of publicly funded education programming and possibly the last bastion of consistently decent investigative reporting from us soil. www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/
oh i'm sure there are plenty of organizations who would love to take trump to court.
hey, don't group all of us poor, dumb people together. i didn't vote for the guy.
well that's the problem with democracy. you have to give a shit about everyone and not just the people you like.
frontline is great. i find their documentaries to be informative and quite unbiased. the way they presented how the election unfolded was great. they also did a piece on the syrian war and then did one on the government held area in damascus and did a really good job of showing how the syrian people living in government held areas felt about the war.
worth mentioning that trump's proposed budget calls for killing pbs funding.
ugh every time that place gets forgotten someone brings it back up again.
i'm worried that trump will have an andrew jackson moment, you know something like, "[justice roberts] has made his decision, now let him enforce it."
only in nc does snow cause your car to burst into flames
the car on fire just makes that picture 1000% more funny
i live in north carolina. we are all going to die. please help us.
just left the area a few days ago to head to key west. i regret nothing.
they always show pictures of stores running out of eggs, milk and bread. like the south sees warnings of snow and immediately gets a hankering for french toast.
hides in the background while everyone takes it out on nc folk. lives in ga
2.5 feet yesterday here in buffalo, but we're equipped to handle it (most of us anyway). i won't give the south crap for not being able to deal with rare weather.
we got more snow than that for sure, but it came down very quick and i think it caught a lot of people off guard. combine that with a lot of people who can't drive in the snow, and you have a mess. we do have a lot of plows across the state, but remember that nc has the second most highway lane miles, right behind texas. during a storm the highways are the first priority.
well, they probably are able to cope with hurricanes better than us in the north. we have fleets of snowplows, piles of salt and sand, and people trained to use said things, while nc doesn't. not saying the drivers don't handle it poorly, slow the fuck down and take your time, you're all equally as stupid when it comes to driving in snow. your jacked up truck is just as vulnerable to the laws of physics. source: minnesotan.
actually, there was a lot more than 2.5 inches that day. this is the south. they don't often get snow in any amount and don't really have the equipment to deal with it when it comes in any amount. couple that with the lax safety inspections (read mostly bald tires) and it is the perfect storm. it is best to stay home if you can when you are here and it snows. on another note, if you do get stuck in this kind of thing, you won't find a nicer bunch of folks to help you get out.
"it's not moving, better just keep it floored, should move eventually."
when it snows in texas cars literally just flip over like a dog wanting it's belly rubbed.
this was some idiot in i think either a charger or a challenger who revved his engine so hard trying to get out of the snow that he caught his car on fire.
we got a foot of snow in northern minnesota this week, schools opened 2 hours late, i had to work at 6 am.
us down here in atlanta would like to have a word with you.
i live in charlotte, nc... snow makes everyone retarded. as if people here weren't bad enough drivers already.
north carolinian here. i can confirm we have run out of milk and eggs and have begun to eat our young.
i imagine the lady with the phone just casually ordering some pizza delivery or something
this should be at the top. people weren't having trouble that day because of the snow. it was because every road in the city was a sheet of ice. i've lived in cleveland for 30 years where it snows all the time and have lived in raleigh for 2 years. i know a thing or two about driving in the snow. the ice was unlike anything i've ever seen that day and made for horrific driving conditions. and on top of all that, raleigh probably has two plow and salt trucks in the entire city. i was driving near where this picture was taken at glenwood ave that day. there's no way an average car can get up and down that hill when it's covered in ice.
another thing that's never brought up is the different terrain. i'm from east tennessee and have been traveling to chicago for work a decent amount this year. the folks in chicago like to bust balls about pictures like this. chicago is fucking flat and the roads are all parallel. shit's a lot easier to drive on when there's no hills and you don't have to turn. my drive home from the office i have to go up and over 3 or 4 moderately sized hills with decent grade on curvy roads that have been lightly brined.
i really like this description, because as an atlantan, the exact same situation exists here. also, northerners like to brag about how well they can handle snow, but then on the news you will see 50-car pileups in places like boston, chicago, and minneapolis.
i'm from canada and we deal with snow all the time. when i see a picture like this, i never think 'lol so stupid they don't know how to drive, it's so little snow compared to what we get'. i always figure since you're temperature probably hovers at just 0c, it starts as freezing rain which is a pain in the ass even over here. add the snow you mentioned, some lack of experience (i mean it does play a factor, here we drive in snow and ice as early as october/november and as late as april) and it's a shit show. not sure if everyone here had snow tires or even all seasons on, but that plays a big factor in collisions too. i mean i guess i'm saying people shouldn't judge too quickly.
yep. went for the standard grocery run last night and now the kids will be having pb&j's on hot dogs buns this weekend. i've heard cereal and orange juice pair well together...
go to the butterfly sanctuary! trust me! my girlfriend dragged me in but it was magical!
nah man. we kill for milk sandwiches. get with it :p
freezing rain turned ice storm is the devil. magically turns everything into a freshly zamboni'd ice rink. trees and power lines becomes like leaves in fall. not even a musher can navigate in those circumstances.
as a vermonter, freezing rain and ice can be worse than 2 feet of snow
they also didn't let people leave work until the roads already looked like this
not only that, but everyone in that picture is a native new yorker that "knows how to drive in the snow." no, you fucking don't. because it snows here once every three years, maybe, and you've been here two, and the conditions are not parallel. and, now, not only do i, a native, have to deal with my own inexperience in driving on snow and ice, but i have to worry about your cocksure ass and your "expert driving" killing me too. protip: when you're at your office, and all of the locals say "shit, we need to leave," fucking leave! i was home by noon that day, safe, with a giant mug of hot tea, while my s.o. was sitting on creedmoor road for six hours, because she's "used to indiana, so this is no problem."
atlanta native, i'm just gonna stay quiet and hang out with you.
as a nc resident, people here also don't understand that slamming on your brakes or making sudden turns makes you slide when going over ice. this is when people know they are on ice.
"hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* "hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* "hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* "hey, i'm stuck in the snow. can you help?" "sure i'll be right over." *gets stuck in the snow* repeat ad infinitum
it's bizarre how people will respond to loss of traction on snow or ice with pinning the throttle which causes even less traction. a modicum of common sense tells you that spinning the tires beyond the point of traction, you know, causes a lack of traction. it's like their only thought is "gas pedal equal go. me no go. me need more gas pedal. that make go." meanwhile there's the unmistakable sound of spinning tires (or for most cars, single tire). i watched a guy take around 3 minutes to move 15 feet in a parking lot because there was a lot of ice from the night before and he was red-lining the fucking engine. he even got out twice to look at his situation before resuming the pointless single tire spinning. dude, you would have moved faster by trying to go slower. edit - since some people are getting pissy, i witnessed this in a northern state, close to canada, where we get regular snow. we had around 10 inches just this december.
it seems next to impossible for an engine to catch fire from the driver reving the engine too long. isn't there a cooling system?
"hmm, maybe if i got this blowtorch to melt the ice around my tires..."
ha! i'm a genius! the friction from spinning my tires in the snow will melt it around me, thus freeing my vehicle. what could possibly go wrong?
houston with even the hint of winter precipitation is like the apocalypse. people buy out bottled water and canned food, batteries, generators, it's insane. and then nothing happens.
it's all those trucks made top heavy from the giant gun racks. to counter that you need to have a large pair of solid brass truck nuts installed.
can confirm. i live in austin. a couple of years ago we got 0.5 inches of snow, so work and everything else shut down. i'm from the northwest where 0.5 inches doesn't even count as snow, so drove to breakfast without any problem. saw multiple flips and crashes on the way. still not sure how austinites managed to do that.
well that was good fortune. better chance of getting it covered by insurance, just blowing the engine would be 100% out of pocket. i'm certainly not advocating doing that, just saying that he acted so incredibly stupid that it probably worked out ok for him
in nc, we just wait for the sun to do the work of snow removal. schools will be closed all next week.
in iowa we just get several feet of snow, no school delays or anything, and then the school principals yell at kids for not leaving 4 hours earlier and being late. the only time we'd ever really get cancellations is if it was so cold that kids could literally die while waiting for the busses
after bing watching the walking dead was expecting a different walker.
i heard about fights in the grocery store over bread. people go insane over french toast around here.
why are people buying milk and eggs? if power goes out those go to shit fast. get non-perishable items. ya'll should know better, same food stuffs you get for hurricanes you get for ice storms/blizzards w
the same thing happens during the first snowfall every year here in mn. the ground is still pretty warm, the first inch of snow melts, then the extra snow and cold on top of it causes it to freeze, making a nice layer of hidden ice. a few years ago (2014 i think?) we had the first snowfall with the requisite inch of ice, and then it got so cold that the ice layer stuck on the roads for 2-3 months in some places.
what is a milk sandwich? up north we have milk steaks.
that's what people don't understand about winter weather in the south. the snow accumulation doesn't matter, there's usually freezing rain, sleet, thawing snow that freezes again over night. i've lived in nc, and in co. driving in powdery snow is not as hard as driving in ice. winter storms are also less frequent in the south, so for most municipalities it actually does make more sense to just close everything for a day once a year or so, than it does to maintain a fleet of snow plows.
the northeast us got pwned by one of those back in '97 or '98.
in canada when it freezing rains, we grab the skates and the hockey sticks and go play hockey on the roads!
snow is easy to drive in. ice is hell without studded tires.
ha haha hahahaaah hahaha hahahahaaah hahhahaaa! i lived in atlanta 15 years and finally got out last august! now i'm in--- oh shit. i'm in new jersey.
charlotte has over 70 trucks for this, we just purchased 12 more last year to deal with the completed 485
unfortunately common sense isn't common. when you grow up with cold and snow you learn when you're 2 or 3 and you slip and fall on your ass that ice is slippery. when you grow up in an area with poisonous insects it becomes habit to shake out your shoes before putting them on (something i need to be reminded of when i visit friends in these places).
if the car isn't actually moving and the engine is redlining the cooling system does t work so great. it's based around air moving through the radiator which doesn't happen when the car is not moving.
the coolant can only take you so far. that's like saying that because my computer has fans that it will never overheat no matter how much i overclock it and tell it to do.
well, as a russian for whom 2,5 inches of snow is a normal january in moscow, i've seen a ton of truckers with actual fire torches warming up their engines because diesel here sucks
if you dont want your cars to explode go to africa. (or australia)
open it right outside of one of the many military bases. you can just resell the fire cars to unwitting fng's for double the bluebook value with a 22% interest rate. source: was an fng, got bamboozled. became salty, watched fng's get bamboozled.
for real though. i live in oklahoma and worked at lowe's during college. anytime bad weather was supposed to happen we were packed. one year corporate had to send us a delivery truck full of generators because people kept buying them. like, were putting their name on a list. an 18 wheeler. of generators. at $500 a piece. the store made bank that week.
at least texans buy non perishable items, over here in atlanta it's bread and milk, two of the most perishable items ever. always, and only, bread and milk for some dumbass reason. also, same outcome.
i thought it was the coal smokestacks and 19' confederate flagpoles.
it snowed 21 inches in 2 days where i live. but we know what to do, and have the equipment to clear it all in about a week. all main roadways were pretty derivable within a day. sucks that you folks have so much trouble with it, but it honestly is pretty understandable. when your driving on the freeway it feels like you are in control going 60 mph or w.e you drive, but once you get into a situation that you need to stop, most of you don't have winter tires, and really going that speed on snow / ice, you don't have a hope in hell.
so you're saying if i screw something up on my car, i should set it on fire and claim incompetency?!? car insurance companies don't want you know to this secret!
if it won't work it can go the way of old yellow.
nc just isn't equipped to handle snow in the way northern states are. nobody has snow tires/chains, nobody has any experience driving in snow, we have a limited number of plows, etc... snow is just no bueno here.
that just happened in in co, my nephew tried telling me there was a snow day and i went all "boy, lying to me this early in the day is gonna bring he demons out of me cause there is only a few inches of snow on the ground!" then i checked the temp and saw it was like 0 degrees and said oh ok dude go play a video game i'll make some breakfast
nope, that would be the end of the show. frozen zombies can't walk. just pop their brains with an ice pick on a stick and when spring thaw comes around the zombie apocalypse is over. i'm surprised they went as far north as dc with the plot. it gets below freezing for days there. kind of sucks when you realize this is only a warm climate show.
if it makes you feel any better, as a minnesotan. we understand. we just like to give you guys shit. ice+snow fucks our shit up too. the *only* real difference is, the northern dot's have huge cache's of salt in giant mountains, and large containers of liquid salt spray stored throughout metro areas, so whenever the freezing rain starts, they hit the highways immediately to put down a layer of salt. most of the southern states just don't have that infrastructure because they really don't need it most of the time. but ya, we had a good 1/2" of ice with a good 9"-10" of snow up here a few weeks back, and trust me....it was a complete shit show in minneapolis.
as opposed to summer, when you grab your inline skates and hockey sticks to play in the road?
yup, here in texas all we get is ice if it gets cold enough and it's the worst.
strange. perhaps the news team got the last part but reported that as the total? it was certainly reported as 12 trucks. i was in shock when they said it. btw, thank you for the correction.
what places do you speak of? i need to avoid them at all costs
i'd also be willing to make a bet that the type of person who would choose to continually rev their engine in this manner is also the same type who would not be the most meticulous in their car maintenance...
so just have someone in front blowing into the engine while you rev it forward then?
i read that and laughed out loud for real. i am in canada and it's -31 celcius right now. nobody moves, nobodies happy. the kids watch television and adults drink and play cards. we wait for march when it hits a balmy -10 again.
i've learned some of the craziest cold weather engine tricks from russian guys. most of them incredibly dangerous but i guess where they learned this stuff you either get your truck running or you die. one guy's battery was dead and we didn't have jumper cables so he pulled the good battery out and held it upside down with connections touching directly on the dead battery. not something the average american would think to do.
in australia your car will bite you and is poisonous though.
the best snowblower i ever owned was purchased during a blizzard that was way out of normal for that area. we'd get snow, but not like that. every snowblower was sold out except this monstrosity that nobody could afford, and i was stupid enough to not care. i could have leveled antarctica with that thing. it stayed at the house when i moved away, the new buyer wanted it so much he made it a condition of the sale.
"i'd uhhhh like to return this unused generator."
bread, milk, and eggs. because if shit hits the fan, you're gonna want some french toast.
as an outsider living in georgia right now it is the strangest thing i have seen my entire life. went to get dinner yesterday and it was absolute mayhem at kroger's. there were literally twenty people in line for the checkout. i was very confused until someone told me it was on account of a prediction of 33 degrees and sleet today. i mean, what do you folks do with all that bread when it snows? insulation? traction? does it become currency in case of societal collapse?
if you have those, and god forbid -- a lightbar, there is no number of truck nuts that can help you. what you have to do in that case is unload your atv from the back and proceed as if you were muddin' in very cold mud.
i grew up in fort worth, and live in d.c. now. people up here don't believe me when i tell them texans use sand instead of salt.
the local problem in west texas is the high rate of morons we have. we've got the guys who feel that a 4x4 truck can do 100mph out on city streets in the ice and snow and "shale handle it jes fahn", and then they scream through a red light or stop sign and take out a bunch of people who were minding their own business and now you've got a bunch of people in the hospital, some of them die on the scene. and the excuse? "whale ah have a pigyep truck, it shoulda stopped!" bonus points: 8 out of 10 of these accident causing morons don't have a license or insurance. and half of those lost their license due to drinking and driving.
yep. i always get a good laugh out of southerners freaking the hell out over an inch of snow, but it's really about the capability of your infrastructure and your preparedness level. governments in atlanta or birmingham aren't going to spend the money to have enough snow plows sitting around on the off chance that it will snow. add in the fact that people aren't used to driving on snow or ice and you have a disaster. the thing a year or two ago (don't remember exactly) where the entire interstate around atlanta shut down for hours was part overreaction, though. y'all don't have to rush home as soon as the snow starts to fall. here in utah, i spent my morning being outraged because roads hadn't been plowed from last night's storm by noon. there were a few slide offs and fender benders, but nothing caught fire.
no, that would be arson. if it happens on its own, its not arson.
hold on, the dog's name was 'yellow'!? i've been living a lie for 30 years! i've been calling him 'yeller' but- my god -they are american so of course.. with the accent.. i, i need to sit down.
no, there's a lot of transplants in nc from the north, so they have experience driving in snow. but we don't get snow, we get snow, sleet, freezing rain, a whole mix of crap. but people drive like it's snow. there's the problem.
i love how the person replying to my comment from michigan is a jerk, and the minnesotan is the nicest one. i need to visit minneapolis sometime, seems like a great city.
it's not just experience, the cities themselves don't have the infrastructure and equipment to deal with it either.
not to mention, they buy tires that are appropriate for their climate. which to say are likely not snow rated, likely not even all weathers.
florida in the summer, and the southwest because of scorpions.
i sense some hostility between you and your uncle.
hibernation is real. humans just have to be awake for it.
how is this different from using jumper cables? isn't it just the same as long as you don't touch the connectors? edit. not suggesting anything here, i just don't know anything about car batteries.
when my dad died i didn't have a need for his $2000 snow blower with tank treads because my neighbor liked to snow blow my sidewalk and driveway. now my neighbor moved away so i'm going out tomorrow to buy a new snowblower for around $700 that won't be nearly as good as the one i could have had for free 5 years ago. sorry just venting.
excrement hasn't even hit the oscillator yet and i want some goddamn french toast.
we use sand up here in idaho. it is less damaging to the road surfaces than salt is. but the thing is, sand doesn't melt ice, it just gives you traction on top. so you have to keep applying sand, is not just a one-and-done thing. and salt is only useful if it is warm enough.
i am roadtripping from new jersey to los angeles at the end of this month, and dallas and amarillo are two of our stops. should i be frightened?
"enough" snow plows. i think you meant none. heavy snow in the deep south happens maybe once every 5-10 years. there are no plows and no salt trucks. during "snowpocalypse" the other year, kids were stranded on school buses overnight & local businesses invited stranded travelers to sleep in there overnight. and god bless chik-fil-a, yes it sucks that their owner's a homophobe, but they cooked up all the food they had & ran it out for free to all the people stuck on the roads near them. much of my family including my rather old mom were stranded but she was able to walk to safety using the snow boots she bought while visiting me in the frozen hellhole i live in now. i don't know if you can even buy snowboots down south without special ordering them online!
right, i was trying to clean my engine with gasoline while it was running. boy! i am one silly goose!
cary = concentrated area of relocated yankees. also, psa: 4x4s may get you going in winter weather, but they will not stop you. i see so many assholes driving unnecessarily fast in snow/sleet.
nah, they are also correct in that we don't have the systems set up to clear the roads. we don't have plows that go around or salt being put on the road. it is the combination of all of the above that causes such issues.
i love minneapolis. it's not for everyone, but for me, it's one of the few cities in the u.s. that i immediately felt "at home" in. (here and boston). i would recommend never visiting during january-march though....just....don't do it.
midwesterner here. 67% of my town's annual budget is spent on winter road management. salt, brine solution, plows and their maintenance, and the wages and benefits of the people who drive them. *that* is why we can get 4-8 inches of snow overnight and still get up and go to work in the morning like nothing happened.
we live in the southwest. my dad bought snow tires over a year ago and has been keeping them in the spare bedroom. he's so fucking excited he finally got to use them he's called 3 times already asking if i need a lift anywhere.
also, lots of the midwest does this too because of brown-recluse spiders.
the radiator fan is really only enough for idle conditions. that's why you'll see a giant blower in front of or cars on dynometers or other testing setups.
brb calling patent office. but seriously, that fan's for when you're not moving *and* not pegging the tachometer.
it's not really dangerous.. unless the upside-down battery is leaking acid i guess, or if you drop it and kills a pet or something.
up in maine they sell walk behind snowblowers that have bulldozer tracks instead of wheels. no joke. fucking unstoppable. you don't even have to turn the tillers on for under a foot of snow, it just pushes it out of the way.
there's always some way back in the cupboard. no, keep going. yes, all the way back.
colorado checking in. see texas plates ass up in the ditch on the regular.
dallas yes, amarillo no. dallas is a cluster on a normal day. amarillo knows how to handle winter weather (as much as any other southerly plains city).
actually they brined most of the main roads in the last 2 days. so once the initial rain washes all that salt off onto the shoulder we'll be left with pristine asphalt for the sleet/ice to stick to. fun times. p.s. i actually saw that mess on glenwood. i gave up before trying to climb that hill and stopped at a hotel to wait things out. it had taken me 4 hours to travel what normally takes me 30 minutes in rush hour traffic. semi trucks stuck spinning tires on slight inclines, cars skidded off everywhere, fender benders scattered like confetti, people driving with no windshield wipers and trying to see out of a small spot of snow-free windshield stopping periodically to scrape off a bit more. i was so done. lol
god there's nothing like taking the ol' shitty 1995 corolla out at 2am to go hooning on fresh snow.
southwesterner here. it snowed last night, and they shut down the city this morning - we need to stop spending 67% of our budget on party hats and breakfast burritos. but those burritos are so delicious.
you should humor him and let him take you somewhere
even then sometimes it isn't enough. there is a bridge tunnel in norfolk/hampton virginia that is used to get from one side of the bay to the other. in the summer it can take 4 hours or more to get from one side to the other in rush hour in spite of it only being like 4 miles long. when it gets hot people sit still for so long their cars overheat.
yea the fan is part of the system, it's not what cools the whole thing. it's like having a ceiling fan on in your home and expecting that to keep it cool during a hot ass day with the windows open.
people were literally *volt*ing over the turnstyles to get to them.
just cook it on the hood of one of the burning cars. problem solved.
that's how i learned how to drive. we used to chain a 63 chevy hood to the bumper and pile about a dozen people on it. double donuts in parking lots & unused airport runways- last one on the hood gets a 6 pack. hell yes.
this! pulling air through from behind is much safer than pushing it in from the front.
man, i only saw this guys name this morning and didn't get a chance to read the full story. i was sure he died trying to stop the shooter. i'm impressed he's doing ok.
getting shot 7 times? he has a promising rap career.
thank you for sharing this. what a true hero. i'm so happy to see he is ok. if anyone has a way of getting in touch with him, please tell him he inspired me (and all of us), and i would love to meet him.
random but serious question. is he responsible for that hospital bill? do they have a "hero waiver"? i've always wondered this.
that's the look of drug induced bliss if i've ever seen it.
chris mintz* is his name. not mints. damn auto correct.
seriously, all the headlines about this guy make it seem like he's dead! this photo just seriously uplifted me.
the shots to his chest must have been deflected by the shag carpet god blessed upon him.
where are the other 299 spartans that he led into battle?
i'm glad that when i woke up this morning the only news i've seen about this story is this guy, and i haven't seen any pictures or identifying info about the shooter this is more the way it should be when it comes to these stories being in the public eye
i dont like reading sad stories so i must have skimmed one of the others about this guy and i thought he died...i stopped reading when i heard that he said something about it being his son's 6th birthday. lo and behold the guy lived!!! that's fantastic!!! kudos to his doctors for all their training and dedication to their profession!!!!
god damn that dude's good looking. it's not gay if they're a national hero, right?
what a stud. i believe there are a lot more people like him than we actually realize. i guarantee there are more people like mr. mintz than there are people willing to shoot up schools. it's america: most do the right things
this man *is* a hero. that word is tossed around too much these days for damn near anyone. but this guy. this guy is a paragon.
this may be a weird reaction, but i feel like this guy should never work another day in his life. he is a true fucking hero. we need to put people like this on a pedestal for our society to look up to. e: to clarify, i meant more that we should reward him for what he did, not that he literally shouldn't work again. in a day and age where people get rich for such a wide range of vapid shit, this act should be compensated for the enormous act of sacrifice and bravery that it was.
his face just says damn it feels good to be a gangster.
now this is a use of the word hero i can really agree with. a true hero by every definition of the word.
7 bullets?! if i tried to stop the shooter, all 7 of those would have somehow found their way into my face.. this dude should buy a fucking lottery ticket. now.
yeah. i mean, a lot of people say they'd die for something like this and this guy went through with it. the fact he didn't actually die is pretty damn lucky (for him and humanity) and awesome. the real problem is that the people who are prepared to sacrifice their lives for something like this tend to be the ones that die. it's sort of the nature of the game - natural selection in one of its worst guises. i really hope this guy gets drenched in fertile women because god knows we need more people like him in the world, and his iron balls must harbour some seriously strong product.
he could say it to a job interview. "can you mention a stressful situation you were put in." "i was shot 7. fucking. times. while being a fucking hero."
he's going to school to be a personal trainer too.
attorney here. technically, he is responsible for the hospital bill, but he'll sue the shooter (or in this case, the shooter's estate) for damages and all fee associated with said damages.
a lot of replies here assume he has no insurance. -he's an army vet. might have insurance through the army. -college student. most schools have their own health insurance plans as well. -obamacare. if he doesn't have insurance through the first two, he most likely has it through this. -he could just straight up have some other insurance we don't know about.
thanks for saving everyone, here's your bill for 563,177$.
my exact thought was "*of course* he's fine now, he's so high off of the really good stuff".
i would love it if he had a son named chris jr. or just junior.
the very last sentence is the absolute best way the sheriff could have handled that situation.
honest question here because i cannot seem to find an answer anywhere...but did his charging at the gunman actually have any kind of impact other than the "act of taking bullets in an attempt?" the gunman was killed in exchange of fire with the deputies so obviously he wasn't stopped by the army vet that charged after him.
i wonder how many more years i have before this *doesn't* bring a tear to my eye...
there's also the nursing student who helped stabilize him until the ambulance got there.
it's not gay if you're secure with your sexuality...
it says damn it feels good to have a morphine drip.
just stay active on reddit the next 24 hours. i'm sure you'll find a link popping up soon. it's too early to consider funding, really, the guy and his family are still trying to cope i'm sure.
except this guy didn't exactly dodge them, more like absorbed them and kept going
that's his secret. he's always in mint condition.
i think he already has one. a (nursing?) student tended to him before ambulance got to him, and i guess the only thing he cared about was yesterday was his son's 6th birthday. a man like that sounds like he doesn't want to be drenched in pussy, but rather make sure he is as good of a dad as he can be. this man has his priorities right in life.
"i dont see that on your resume son. i think im going to have to pass." "sir im wearing the medal now from it" "thats nice"
we're sorry, we were looking for at least 4 years experience getting shot at
please like to help this man. one like = one prayer. one comment = ten prayers
it is really that normal for colleges to have their own health insurance plans for students? i've just never heard it talked about my 4 years at college.
i guarantee that dude is going to remember that day for the rest of his life, hopefully in a proud, fond way eventually and not nightmares over it.
pretty sure the guy's name was john jacob jingleheimer smith.
yeah, fuck the shooter, fuck whatever deranged cause he thought he was fighting for.
yeah, seems like the details are fuzzy so i don't want to speculate.
yes. perhaps we should set up a crowdfunding site to create a sperm-bank with only his product? haha.
"that's nice and all but it says here you've been unemployed for over a year." "well i was recovering from -" "i'm afraid we have to reject your application, we're looking for someone who's done a bit more with their life then sit around watching tv."
didnt think about that. im an idiot. but it just sounds like the gunman legitimately took aim at his hands and legs ya know?
it's america. he has the *freedom* to pay the bill.
and he'll likely have a "high risk" asterisk in his file forever meaning higher premiums.
i'm trying to figure out how he got shot in the back while charging *at* someone. and the broken legs? all i can think is that he attempted a charge, missed the shooter and went down from the hits. the shooter then shot the guy in the back after he fell to the ground. the legs thing is perplexing, he might have crawled away and tried to jump out of a window maybe.
let's start a kickstarter to raise the funds to get him to see it. best bet is probably to send me your money and i'll take care of it.
*looks for a job* *gets rejected for being jobless*
shooting in real life is wayyyyyy less precise than movies/games he was likely just pointing his gun at people and pulling trigger.
in canada we have a government program too. it's called universal health care.
land of the mass shooting. home of the astronomical medical bill.
where health care is a privilege but guns are a constitutional right!
yep, like if i get rear ended by someone and my insurance finds out about it, rate raised. it's absurd.
i was in maybe at least 20 grand debt from medical bills by the time i was 21,even being on my parents health insurance. i'm sure i could have done things a little different but chronic issues rack up debt so quick in our health care system in the states.
you can't get money from someone that doesn't have it. that is pretty much a universal thing isn't it?
before and afters were the best on wheel of fortune.
what an interesting name. when ever you are out, do people always shout?
by money order right? i know the mail takes a few days and so does the bank
i think a gofundme account might be more appropriate. sounds like he might need the funds for his medical costs.
exactly. people generally don't know how much impact on your aim squeezing the trigger has. it can throw you aim way off. being scared, panicked, or excited tends to make you yank on the trigger that much harder. also it sounds like they had a hell of a fight over that gun.
everytime i see people in movies hit 20-30 yard shots with a pistol i get slightly frustrated. have they shot pistols? worst scene: the patriot where the main british officer shoots his unrifled pistol with a musket ball and hits someone traveling horizontally across a river while he was on horseback. what the fuck was that?
in quebec we also have a program compensating victims of criminals (crime victims compensation act). it will pay all health cost (even dentist), pay your salary until you're fit to go back to work, etc, etc. it's paid by selling product of criminal activities (houses, cars, etc...)
it's says you get to own guns not get them for free.
if anyone is wondering how healthcare works in america, it's simple. don't. get. sick.
in america it can be a bit different. in some cases, the family or spouse can be held responsible and forced to compensate the victim. if the shooter has no family to collect from, they can then perform a postmortem sperm extraction on the shooter, fertilize an egg with said sperm in order to birth an offspring. this offspring is raised into indentured servitude, and the proceeds of the offspring's labor go to paying off the medical bills of the victim. once the payment is complete, the offspring is terminated.
you can get your items repossessed to pay debt, and any future pay checks you may earn, will have wages garnished. so yeah, don't go around shooting people or causing debt onto others.
yes. the "lawyer" forgot to mention that the shooter doesn't have any assets to sue for.
i always have mixed feelings about this. on the one hand, it's horrible to have a government so deeply authoritarian that it has a list of approved names you could name your children. on the other hand, you have a government that is saving those poor kids from their retarded parents. i'm never going to support civil rights violations like that no matter how fluffy they make it appear, but at least i can easily recognize the good intentions those lawmakers used to pave the road.
with those 7 bullets he could have theoretically killed 7 people. because of this guy, those bullets never accomplished their mission.
there was a teacher who tried to close the door on the shooter but didn't succeed and instead got shot a couple times in the stomach. no one's talking about her.
yeah me too man. nothing makes you feel more helpless than to be continually rejected for jobs for something out of your own control.
the former: if you are talking about in the middle of combat and moving around, very difficult. if you are talking about stupidly standing in the open carefully aiming while being shot at, difficult if the target is moving. if you mean at a gun range, easy, with enough practice. for the latter, that would probably only happen in real life by accident
in america the police spend money from those seizures on military assault gear and open bar, all you can eat parties for the department.
anyone who thinks the us medical system isn't broke, has never had an emergency or a reason to go to the hospital.
names like "4reals" are stupid in the first place but names like lucifer, like, i get it, but there is such a thing as freedom of expression.
true that! i'm not sure how familiar you are with apprenticeships in the uk, but i was once rejected for one because i didn't have enough experience...
you missed the margarita machine. every police department needs one of these first, before they could even think about wasting the proceeds of civil forfeiture on compensating the victims of crime.
you're killing me here, so much quality in this thread. is death covered under universal health care?
seriously. what kind of camp did those people go to?
the fuck? i can sorta see not hiring someone for being unemployed for a long time (yes, it's shitty and shouldn't be that way, but i *can* sorta see their point too, risk wise), but they're literally telling you they wont teach you because you haven't already learned?
well, to be fair the proceeds from civil forfeiture don't necessarily come from criminals here in the us. law abiding citizens get their property taken and not returned even when they are cleared of wrongdoing sometimes. not really fair to just give that money to victims of crime, right?
all those endorphins in his pure little brain when he gets approval from his owner. i love dogs so much.
my four-year old is scared of dogs. no reason, just always has been. yesterday, a big woolie newfoundlander came up to him and sniffled his face. i thought my kid would be petrified but he laughed. i asked him if he didn't find the big dog scary and he said "no mom, he smiled at me!"
i've got some bad news, that's actually a polar bear cub and is going to grow up one day
dogs should rule the world and not humans because they're so pure
they truly are nuggets of compressed love and joy. if i wasn't careful i'd probably have about twelve.
imagine if it was so easy to get people high by saying a few words to them.
that dog looks like every day is the best day ever.
huh, you actually switched the pictures around, instead of just mirroring the whole image.
drop us a modmail if you'd actually like something done bud.
did the pizza on the roof just magically appear? i'm confused
my fucking dog just ate a whole goddam frozen pizza that i was keeping outside to stay cold for tonight's dinner. pure my ass.
have you ever met a corgi? not pure. purely mischievous
yeah i love when they chase down small living things and bite them to death.
it looks like it's berating the young hooligans in its front yard.
huh, you took the time and effort to notice this, instead of just understanding the joke and laughing
because op's account is only 3 months old with a shit ton of karma. its an account they sell to bots to influence reddit.
there's a recent post on r/science about people who used more than 2 social media platforms were more at risk for depression and anxiety, it has like 14000 upvotes
snuffles was my slave name. you shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.
my dog watched me pick up his poop to throw in the weeds. now he poops in the weeds.
i don't think people realize i was agreeing with you.
"oh bother, there's a group of ruffian youths milling about on the lawn! i best root them out before they trample the petunias!"
goldens, labs, newfs, st. bernard's and for some reason, mastiffs genuinely the kinds of dogs that can make someone change their mind about dogs!
wait what? can you explain or at least re word it?
i'm currently working in psychiatry, and the psychiatrists who specialise in adolescent psychiatric cases are really averse to overuse of social media. there has been literature out for a while showing the correlation between this and low mood, and subjectively a lot of the consultants/attendings i've spoken to feel that their case load and intensity has worsened alongside the rising prevalence of snap/insta/whatever.
tell me, summer. if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?
nice job throwing away your dog shit like a proper owner rather then tossing it into the bushes like a lazy cunt.
what about the poor people who get into those weeds. that's not the proper place to be throwing dog shit.
curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the petunias as they were trampled was "oh no, not again." many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the petunias had thought that, we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.
i wonder if it's possible that it goes the other direction, though. to me, it seems more that a teenager's development and personality determines their social media behavior, rather than social media shaping who they are. obviously this is anecdotal, but just thinking about my own adolescence (i'm only 22, so social media was around)...i had a couple of friends who were emotionally immature, so when they got into social media, the way they used it wasn't the greatest. but it's not as if it changed them. it was just one more platform for them to use, for better or for worse. the way they chose to use it wasn't surprising at all. and then there was me and friends with similar personalities, who pretty much used it to ask each other homework questions, plan events, and talk about tv shows.
as a garbage man nothing pisses me off more than having to get 20 dog shit bags out of the bottom of a can. and yes thank you for picking up your dog's shit at the same time.
those poor people just stepped in shit. like we all do. and if that's the worst first world problem they deal with that day then they'll have had a decent day, you whiny bitch.
it's also freezing in his freezer... i would think.
i quickly frost and cool my food this way. it's one of those things that you didnt think you'd need, but you really reallyy do.
guys, it's propably like 0-10c outside where he is and either he didnt want to warm up his fridge with it or the pizza box was too large to fit. it's not rocket surgery, i do it all the time.
that was a great comment 'til it got ruined with an edit.
i'd say so, since it shows up on the share tab alongside facebook, instagram, tumblr, twitter, pinterest, etc. that may not be the best metric. maybe something like a social network?
i put 6 packs on my deck on cold days while preparing for watching the jets on sunday. i need each and every one of those beers to drown the disappointment playing on the tv.

*coming this fall, nbc's newest buddy comedy: bern & cain!* cain: hey bern, did you forget to buy milk again? bern: i didn't forget! the market was out of whole, and you know how i feel about the 1%... *laugh track* cain: i swear bern, choosing you as a roommate was the worst decision i've ever made. bern: not worse than your choice of running mate! *laugh track* cain: well at least i got to choose one! *oooohhhh!*
i like to think they're giggling because they wore the same tie.
mccains biggest mistake was to bring palin to the ticket
mccain is a good sport. during one of his rallies in front of hundreds he got woman asking a question/yelling about obama and him being a muslim terrorist. he said no, no. . . . no. barack obama is a decent gentleman and trustworthy ( not exact the words but it came to this). the people were boo-ing mccain at his own event.
"so he says 'do you love me?' and she says 'no! but that's a real nice ski mask!"
mn senator amy klobuchar on the left, mccain's right.
statler - "hey, these guys are trying to take our gig?" waldorf - "we runnin for president in 2020?" statler - "doubt they'll be running anywhere by then after trump." waldorf and statler - "doh, oh oh oh oh!"
i kinda feel that if this were a picture of hillary laughing with a republican, the comments here would be vastly different.
this is awesome; two guys from the opposite end of the spectrum actually getting along.
i've always respected the fuck out of john mccain, but when he ran for president he was carl rove in a john mccain suit. he went from being a completely reasonable, respectable politician and veteran to a disgusting front for the party line. it still amazes me how drastic that change was.
sanders / mccain 2020. i would vote for that ticket ...make america sane again!
arlo guthrie said something like "on all sides of any issue, there are those who give a damn and those who don't. and sometimes you find you have more in common with those who give a damn on the other side, than those who agree with you but don't." john mccain is the republican president you guys should have elected.
who cares about elections when you have that much money in your bank account? you could buy an african country or island and be the king there
pitch this to nbc. i could see an snl skit coming out of it at the very least.
only if you have recurring guest appearances by biden.
bern and mccain. bern and cain would be a completely different show but i'm too stressed out to come up with witty banter between bernie and herman cain. something something pizza and socialism.
*they're bernie and mccain!* *yes, bernie and mccain!* *one is rebellious, the other's seen pain!*
can we have a back-to-back block scheduling for *bern & cain* and *biden & bush*? that shit would be absolute flame. it'd take place in the same universe, of course. all sorts of crossovers would be possible. even throw in crazy barney frank to act as the irrational neighbor
it was, but not for the reasons you're thinking. mccain lost mostly because obama was unstoppable. palin was a catalyst that helped to unhinge the republican party. she gave a voice to the beginnings of what became the tea party...which eventually led to paul ryan...and mutated into trumpism. the gop was already fracturing by the time bush left office, which is another reason why mccain lost. it might not have been as bad if she hadn't been on the ticket, but it was already happening.
after 8 years of the dumpster fire that was the bush administration, the republicans wouldn't have stood a chance if jesus himself ran
exactly. i don't agree with many of mccain's positions, but he seems to be a classy guy who i wouldn't be terrified of running the country. it's pretty clear that he is in politics for the right reasons.
(shakey old lady voice) *he's - he's an arab!* jeesus. i'm glad mccain immediately denied that. trumps response wouldn't have been as endearing.
for some reason people choose to interpret disagreement as hate. its absurd. its toxic. it needs to stop.
the people in that video honestly make me cringe. makes all republicans look bad.
john mccain is a well-respected politician on both sides. he lost because of sarah palin.
a good guy who despite being former pow is a warhawk.
he would have been a great president, too bad for karl rove and south carolina, and too bad obama didn't come along 8 years later
yup. pretty much why he and romney lost, and trump won. both mccain and romney are decent human beings who wouldn't "go there" to pander to racial fears of uneducated white men. all while trump was pointing at president obama and screaming kenyan muslim at the top of his lungs.
most all of them do in fact get along. political theater is a very real thing and people buy it all day long.
they'd both love to see trump impeached. this is not the ends of the spectrum. also, they're both awesome.
you can tell this is /r/pics because it's marginally civil
2000 mccain was reasonable. 2008 mccain thought that a complete moron was qualified to be vice president.
i really think you're overestimating their wealth by a huge margin lol
or they could pull a republic of molossia and becomes presidents of their own little pieces of america!
i really thought larry david was an awesome bern, too.
biden would be the plot catalyst next door neighbor.
and just like that, tmbg's purple tupee is playing in my head as bern & mccain.
they're bernie, they're bernie, they're bernie and mccain-cain-cain-cain!
i can imagine a fandom for this on tumblr with far reaching theories and a shit ton of rule 34 probably, because internet.
yeah but i don't understand, is it a dark situation or a comical one?
it's gonna be interesting to read historians and sociologists looking back at the 2008 election with a greater perspective. the obama campaign's momentum was partly because of a well organized campaign and likeable candidate, but also the overwhelming tide of frustrations, hopes and dreams of the american public. people who wanted a change saw a lot more in obama than was reasonably expected, and envisioned promises he himself never made. there is an animated music video, vote 4 hope by mc yogi, that is a pretty good summary of what people felt and were wanting out of obama.
yeah, and now the republicans have the biggest majority in, what, 80 years?
yeah, because jesus was a middle-eastern jew handing out free healthcare and food to the poor while having pretty negative relations with money lenders, and thus would have run as a democrat.
2008 was an election year where i wasn't scared of either obama or mccain winning. i knew they differed but both were men of honor and integrity.
she's wrong, but i can't help but think how many poor old people read things on the internet and don't know it's a scam and it's a lie. they are from an era where the news was pretty straight forward and you didn't have some jerk off blogger writing "obama from kenya!"
i do wish he wouldve said that even if he was it wouldnt matter, but it was a nice moment
exactly, me and my sisters absolutely couldn't agree less on lost things political. and i have friends as well that are in the same boat. but i love my sisters to death and i find nothing more enjoyable that breaking bread and drinking beer with those same friends i don't agree with sometimes.
i think one of the biggest problems (recently, at least) is that with a man like trump, and the issues present during this past election cycle, it's so easy for people to take things personally. as someone who benefits from the aca, it's hard for me to listen to an acquaintance tell me it's terrible and should be repealed without a replacement. i'm sure that any woman who's had to deal with sexual assault must have a hard time listening to someone try to defend what trump said on that bus. those are just two examples. when your opinions and ideas go against the well-being of another person, it's easy for that person to see it as more than just a disagreement.
as a conservative moderate, every day i hear more of the same complaints and hate from republican politicians and regular people ("obama was a disaster, repeal obamacare, drain the swamp") and not actually talking about solving our problems is a day i get closer to jumping ship to a third party despite the power the party will now have on washington. people like mccain who want to engage in civil discourse and work to find compromises and solutions across party lines are becoming a rarer and rarer thing on both sides.
eh, i don't think you should group the entire crowd. i heard some people gasping and booing when mccain started saying positive things about trump, and that woman who said he was arab is a moron, but there were people who clapped near the end when mccain continued to defend obama.
except the economy was in the shitter before election day. no one with an r next to their name had a chance nationwide. we would have had president clinton in 2008.
except ted cruz - everyone has hated, does hate, and will continue to hate ted cruz
no, these are deadly enemies! it's not like they all are alumni of the same schools, send their kids to the same boarding schools, join the same country clubs, and take donations from the same big players. they are totally different!
yep. career politicians have a whole lot more in common with each other than with you or me. after the cameras go off they go play a round of golf or have lunch together.
mccain doesn't want to see trump impeached, i'm sure he just wants to influence him.
if biden is invited then obama will too, the gang gets high and talk politics while an angry trump complains on twitter about not being invited.
implying that they have more than one? or are you offering to suck anybody's genitals, as long as u/ballsandglue approves?
of course both pairs would share a bed, without it ever getting sexual. leave that to the fan fiction
it's really interesting that you bring that up because in some ways i think trump represents the tide of frustrations, hopes and dreams, of many americans too. if /r/the_donald is to be believed, many of those americans are the same ones that had hoped for enormous change form obama and are now putting their weight behind a candidate whose policies, but also mannerisms and behavior, ensure large change.
i think jesus would condemn this entire country based on consumerism alone.
the christian left is a thing (however small) and they are wonderful people.
the thing is, who were the 1 or 2 strong republican opponents this time around? i didn't think anyone was particularly strong. if mccain ran, maybe he'd have had a tougher time, none of the other candidates this time were strong. and hillary hasn't been elected many times, but she served as secretary of state under obama and has been in politics her whole life. she lost because she *was* qualified, and to many americans, that means she is part of the problem.
this is funny because a few days ago someone posted his picture in old school cool and reddit shit on him. post of picture of him and bernie and reddit loves him.
i was only afraid of mccain winning because of palin. had he had a more sane running mate, i would have probably selected him over obama. but the idea of palin being a heartbeat away from the presidency was just too damned scary.
i was talking about this with some friends recently. if it's true (and i hope so) that means eventually we'll be way better at rooting that stuff out. but, something will replace it. we were musing what things we might not pick up on easily when we're in our 70s, because it'll happen. my friend was like, "yeah, like we'll accidentally walk through a pepsi-beam, where a restaurant has an invisible thing that makes you crave pepsi. so i'll be like wow, i really want pepsi even though i normally don't like soda. and my son will say "dad, you're standing in the pepsi-beam" and point to some little pepsi icon off attached to a wall pointed at me. and i'll be like, no, no, i just really want pepsi."
the way she says "no?" when mccain says no is really depressing. she really believes it and doesn't understand when her guy is telling her shes wrong.
thats a pretty interesting perspective, never really thought of it that way. people in their 70s and up are probly the people most affected by fake news. like younger people that talk about pizzagate as true already have had their minds made up so it doesnt really matter to them, but 70+ people on facebook who probly joined to reconnect with old friends probly do legitimately get tricked by that stuff
i agree with you, i saw this happen with my own grandma during that election. what is a little disconcerting is that she said "arab" like it was such a terrible thing. not muslim, not extremist, just arab. that basically like her saying "but he's black!" however, that generation is generally pretty xenophobic, that's just how it was. baby boomers will soon be replaced, and a little more tolerance will come with that.
my mom's in her sixties and has never had a computer or internet access until recently when she and my step-dad got smartphones and tablets. they are swayed by everything. it scares the shit out of me.
that has absolutely no substance. mccain openly said he wasn't an arab, not "oh well maybe but we dont know we should look into it maybe kinda."
the problem for me, and i'm guessing others, is that while i don't hold people's politics against them and won't refuse interaction, when they start to hold my politics against me and make a problem out of it, i refuse to try to interact with them anymore. i'm a socialist - in socialism's purist form - and one of my friends is a laissez-faire, anarcho-capitalist. neither of us are offended by the others beliefs - confused, maybe, or not understanding, but there's no problem. people, it seems, have forgotten how to peacefully disagree.
this is exactly why people are so upset about this election on a personal level. so many of the policies are personal attacks on people's rights. saying you support that has turned personal. access to weapons and climate change are big and daunting enough to think about it as a broad issue of disagreeing, but possibly a civil discussion. telling someone you value someone who wants to take away reproductive rights and their life-saving healthcare system is a direct hit.
i honestly feel so ostracized as a conservative leaning moderate. my family is ultra conservative and my friends are very liberal, so my opinions get shit on from both sides. it's pretty tough, especially when my stance on most issues is conservative leaning but i couldn't bring myself to vote for a person like trump. oh well, at least i get the privilege of living in a country where my views won't get me shot.
i agree, i really hope the bottom falls out in 2018 and forces statesmen back into power and not these petulant children.
yeah. the democrats perhaps should have saved their ammo, so to speak.
yeah but i imagine it's a result of being criticized and examined for every little choice of speech, clothing, reaction, facial expressions for so many years, to such a degree greater than most male politicians. some people who knew her in the past said that she got more reserved over time in politics. colbert said to politico? that she was pretty charming and charismatic in smaller groups of people but became robotic and fake in larger groups, like stewart mentioned. it's tragic in a way.
pre-determined/robotic seems like the complete opposite of panderer..? *confused*
except the texans who keep voting for him, apparently.
sorry, canadian here. but i was under the impression that bernie doesn't take donations? i thought that was a big selling point of his
pence becomes president of trump is impeached. so he probably does.
calm down. everyone will suck everyone's genitals eventually.
it's interesting because obama and trump supporters want the exact same thing, albeit in very, very different approaches. better jobs, less taxes, a safer country, better healthcare, and more opportunities for their children. with the progressives, obama was the answer because of his messages of hope and the fact that he was so different from career politicians. with the disenfranchised rust belt and others, trump was the answer because of his message of anger and frustration at a system run by elites that doesn't work for you, was so different from career politicians. taking out the rhetoric, lies, and party politics, we all want the same thing and if both sides stopped pointing fingers and accusations, we would be able to achieve so much. unfortunately, human nature -- anger and greed -- will always be a stronger driver of politics and policy.
no i think this election was a lot more about voting against than voting for. i still haven't found a single republican voter in the real world who thinks he is going to be a good president they just voted for him as a vote against hillary because they hated her more than him. ya there are people out there who truly supported him but they aren't nearly as many as the election might lead you to believe. that and this was one of the lowest turnout elections in a long time if i remember correctly.
there is merit to this statement. one black friday i was in line for easily 16 hours at a best buy. the crowd had become hostile over people cutting in line. the policy had to come and supervise to ensure no violence. the energy had became extremely negative. then a man came with a giant cross and started preaching, calling us idolators. now as a christian i dont advocate this approach, but as he preached i had to ask myself, "when's the last time i put this much time and effort for god as i have trying to get this new tv on black friday?" i didnt have an answer. he was right. i felt convicted of my idolatry and consumerism. i no longer participate in black friday
jesus does to every walmart what he did to the vendors in front of that church
you're right. he probably would have run as a socialist.
i can't stand 90% of mccain's policies but by god you won't find me speaking poorly about him as a person or question his motivations as a politician
that's actually a pretty amazing thought, i'd love to muse about shit like that with you guys. thanks for sharing :-p
hell, my 50 y/o step uncle posts baloney articles a lot and it takes me all of two seconds to realize there is 0 credibility from the site, the writer and the claim.
i tend to not hold older people to a high standard when it comes to knowing exact facts if something that's a lie is being spread. younger people who aren't checking sources, i have little to no respect for.
am i so old that i don't know wth pizzagate is or were you just making something up...?
i am illustrating that the scenarios were similar. in fact, almost identical. in both cases, a member of the audience accused obama of being a foreign muslim to deligitimize him. the **responses** of the candidates were very different. we are agreeing here.
day after election someone was talking about how "liberals need to put on their big boys and big girls panties and get over it" and i almost exploded about how this isn't american idol, this is the future of our country, extend a little empathy if people are concerned about a madman running the country.
i feel you on the whole "stuck between two polarized groups" thing. i'm a college aged liberal who leans right on certain issues (some states rights, gun rights, etc), with uber-liberal friends and profs and a mostly ultra-conservative family. i just want to compromise on some shit man, not scream the other bastards down.
that may be part of the issue. if she'd been as genuine throughout the campaign as she was in her concession speech she may have had a better chance. it probably wouldn't have erased the kilimanjaro of shady shit throughout her political career, or the ongoing fbi investigation, but i think the fact that nobody could relate to her was what killed her most. everything she said sounded focus-group approved. people proved that they would rather hear simple, digestible, and somewhat offensive speeches than a bunch of pretty words with no real meaning.
he took donations from the public & likely some small businesses. he didn't take/want donations from wealthy establishment elite
not half bad. yeah, it's all bad! oh hohohohoohooho
i would put good money on the bet that you are a lawyer, legal assistant, or have had many forays into the legal sphere... though i am not so sure as to bet any services to any genitalia that are not my own.
shh don't say their name. i heard they find their tendies that way.
the problem is tribalism. the battle of team red vs team blue has fucked this country beyond belief
oh boy would i like to introduce you to my dad. he is a **yuge** supporter of big cheeto and would enthusiastically extol the virtues of the orange colored buffoon if you'd loan him your ear. in fact i know several unapologetic trump worshippers, what i have never encountered is a person who liked secretary clinton. every clinton voter i know (including me) voted for her either because of her party affiliation or because she wasn't donald trump.
did you get out of line that day? can't really blame if you didn't after 16 hours, just kinda curious.
it shouldn't take jesus to make it evident how crazy and harmful the whole concept is.
a young middle eastern man confronts walmart for their policies. what happens next will warm your heart!
what's the christian left's stance on abortion and contraception?
we have prescription meds that have a side effect list as long as my arm, but marijuana is schedule i.
seems fair, ignore the equal stupidity and ignorance of the older generation, the generation running government and making the tangible decision, and blame the damn kids.
i feel your pain, i'm in the exact same boat. liberal-leaning moderate with a few conservative positions, ultra-conservative family, ultra-liberal friends. fuck, where i work is a mixed bag but even there, everyone is either reallllllly liberal or reallllllly conservative. i can't talk about politics at all except on the internet because i'll get my head bit off from both sides. i made the mistake of admitting i support both feminism and men's rights once. yeah, never getting into that one again.
by merely mentioning frozen then fried processed chicken pieces, you have doomed us all.
the problem is those damn wedge issues: gay marriage, abortion, etc. make no mistake; those *are* very important issues. but it's the strong opinions about these issues, on both sides, that keep people from uniting around the other issues that they agree upon.
i am part of the christian left. but we're diverse. i would say most christian lefts are cool with contraception, but not abortion. i say both have to be legal. i don't like that abortion exists, but until we create a society that stops unwanted pregnancies before they happen and better supports moms, abortion has to be legal. ideally, abortion would never have to be outlawed. we would just make the world such a good place that no one would seek out abortions. that's never going to be the case though. so they should be safe, legal, and accessible.
yeah let's hold different people to different standards, it's only fair to everybody...
that's why you add a laugh track, so they know when to laugh. it makes it funny
you are hereby awarded 500 "reasonable christian" points and 10 tokens of religious levelheadedness. can be reclaimed at any angry atheist near you for a variety of services, such as moral support or a backrub.
right, like, the fact that something disturbs me =/= a need for government to ban it to make me happier. and as far as judging the women who have abortions. i am not even able to carry a child so i've never been in the situation of one and don't really think it's appropriate to judge or condemn. especially since i haven't exactly done anything to make the problem better. idk tho
you should work at the big bang theory they'll love you there.
how could an atheist give me moral support, if they don't have any morals at all? checkmate atheists.
judging the women just makes no sense anyway. judge the society that got them there if you have to judge someone
are you allowed to point a finger gun at the president?
obama wiped a tear from his eye when he said joe was a brother
when you want someone to wait around in case you die, there's nobody quite like joey b.
as i watched this moment on live television i knew in my heart that it would forever be immortalized in gif form
i think obama should resign a few days early just so joe gets to be the 45th president for the next week. he deserves it.
every time this gif repeats an angel gets healthcare.
what's amazing about that hand signal is the subtlety of it. it's not your standard finger gun "you're the man" gesture. if you look closely the thumb goes back towards him first, clearlt indicating - "we did this together barry".
joe biden was one of the best things that ever happened to american politics. what a raging pity he didn't run for president.
i think i speak for at least half the country in saying i wish we could all go back in a time machine to 2015 and convince joe to run. perhaps it wouldn't have made a difference, perhaps trump's momentum was going to work against anyone, but i doubt it. without the constant email bullshit, i think joe could have curb stomped trump.
damn, joe has so much to cry about right now *but obama....we never even got to shoot the rebuplicans...*
when you go to wink but you don't know what eye so in all the confusion you end up winking both.
as a layman with no clue on what i'm talking about, couldn't the vp assassinate the potus and pardon himself?
you can try, but the secret service are packing finger guns of their own. i doubt you'd even get your thumb up before you were finger gunned down.
pfft. you think joe biden is afraid to cry in public?
i told myself not to cry when he mentioned biden. they showed him do this, and i started to cry.
when biden was announced as the vp, i'm pretty sure we all thought he was the lame white dude to take the edge off the cool black guy. turns out biden's a g.
god i respect joe biden so fucking much. he grabbed the hand of the first black president of the united states, and literally walked into the fucking darkness with him. it could have been an *awful* time for them, but he didn't give a fuck. he double fisted his ice cream cones and said "let's fuckin' do this, barry."
when a black man calls you a brother, you know it's real. source: is black, can confirm.
wait! they'd have really made him president if obama died? i thought that was all just a joke.
organize an inauguration ceremony that would embarrass the shit out of whatever blowout trump has planned, with voluntary celebrity endorsement...
can you imagine what the biden/trump debates would have looked like? such a wasted opportunity.
i am still going to miss joe biden in the onion more.
how? i honestly have no idea what he's done in the two terms. to me he always seemed like the cool grandpa just hanging around
i agree, with the added bonus that i think joe biden was actually much more in tune with the working-class american than hillary. he wouldn't have been seen as so elitist and establishment as hillary was.
that's actually a really interesting question. i definitely wish he would've at least thrown his hat in the ring, but it's not very clear why hillary lost to me. part of me thinks a lot of democrats just couldn't support her, given her transgressions, and they would've voted for joe. but it also might've been that the media hyping hillary and saying she had a 99% chance of winning made people think they didn't even need to vote. the democratic turn out was pretty terrible compared to when obama ran, whereas the republicans got pretty much about the same amount of votes as they did in both of those elections.
well, then it would still have been establishment vs bernie. the same thing would have happened. the best thing joe had going for him was that he was quiet in the background while hillary had 40 some-odd years in the spotlight with the last three years being nothing but projection to a 'coronation'. let's imagine a team with a quarterback who telegraphs every throw. you're probably not going to win the superbowl that way...
neither of them are dying. both are being cut loose. barrack is going to get some much needed sunshine, and then be back campaigning so the democrats can take over the house.
please delete this before mike pence gets any ideas.
clever idea but no. murder would fall under state law and president can only pardon federal crimes.
poor guy has a right. wife and daughter die in a car accident. then his son dies of cancer years later. whole family gone, all while attempting to maintain a country.
and then made god damned friendship bracelets for each other. *sobs quietly*
you should see who they're going to make president when obama leaves office.
is this a reference to something? yes, vice president become president if the president dies... it's been that way in the us for some 200+ years now.
the host of the apprentice is now the president-elect of the united states. biden having a week as king doesn't sound so far fetched.
if he runs in 2020 (not out of the question) he'd probably be limited to only one term, though i'm not entirely sure how partial terms count in the context of that rule, so i could be totally wrong.
i don't really know what biden's style of debate is, but i'm sure it's entertaining.
honestly it's not like any intelligent person thought trump did well against clinton so not sure what the difference would have been.
imagine someone giving a gold sprinkled douchebag a good solid 'dad-style' kick in the ass in front a televised audience, yeah it would have been like that.
at least now he'll be able to wash that bitchin' white trans-am.
joe's brashness would have been a perfect match against trump.
people just fucking hate hillary. and with a little help of our comrade putin and trump had it on the bag.
mine will forever be "school bully not so tough since being molested".
as long as vp was able to cover it up long enough to get sworn in, he could probably get away with it. i mean, he's have to be pretty good at coverups, but i'm assuming that the vp has enough connections and experience to potentially pull it off.
"don't forget to watch that scene from porky's i told you about"
you mean to tell me that the joe genes are not going to be passed on?
it was cool having a couple of best bros in the white house after whatever the fuck bush and cheney were.
*googles* oh haha yeah very funny reddit, but seriously who?
i mean i'm not american, but don't you guys have arnold schndwehrfiuewrfiuewyrger as a governor, and wasn't reagan and someone else in films too? and a couple sons of presidents became presidents? seems like more of a popularity contest than anything. yes i know technically all voting is a popularity contest, but you know what i'm talking about here.
my grandfather literally thinks obama won't step down and will instead declare himself emperor. i'm not sure what they all will do when they can't blame obama anymore.* *they'll probably still blame obama.
biden v. palin, biden v. ryan for reference. they were slaughters.
a debate with trump might've ended in fisticuffs. biden' the kinda guy that doesn't take to overrated time-share salesmen.
i know a certain sneering vp that did a whole bunch of stuff.
been saying this for a year. joe has a habit of being too honest, brash, and sticking his foot in his mouth, and in a "normal" election, would have been a bad thing at points. but in this election? he would have been the perfect anti-trump. but his son passing messed with him, and he admitted he just wasn't up for the campaign trail mentally.
"man brings lunch from home to cut down on small joys" which is so true.
i wanna live in this universe, not the one where donald trump manages to become president... :(
wait, i'm pretty sure the president can't pardon himself actually. so congress (or whoever) would just impeach him, and then he's pretty screwed.
in the uk, an unflattering picture of a politician eating a sandwich was widely believed to have been a serious factor in his election loss a few years ago. pictures of people eating are usually easy fodder for mockery. biden manages to take a picture while eating - eating an ice cream no less, a food well known for making a mess and making the eater look stupid - and it's a cooler picture than 90% of pictures of people astride motorbikes. this shit could have been his 2016 campaign poster and he would have won in a landslide.
no we're still good there, he has at least 5 grandkids from his sons beau and hunter and he has a 2nd daughter
sith lord and his apprentice? the twist being that cheney was the sith lord, and he made his apprentice leader to deflect the scrutiny that comes with being a leader. it was a brilliant play.
i'm honestly getting excited just thinking about this
uh, ok. i'll second this, but i'm being 100% serious. it. would. be. blameless. and epic
how many times do they have to be wrong before they realize they're hysterically against a person without any evidence, while supporting a person who the evidence has been piled on against? fuck i hate some of humanity, genuinely, a real cancer holding back our civilization and happiness.
no one can remember any other veep debates except this one. biden made ryan look like a hapless little child. it was great.
oh, i remember that one. he laughed like 90% of the time. it was awkward.
it helps when that vp is fueled by pure hell energy. if cheney turned into a swarm of bats like dracula and flew back home i'd only be slightly surprised.

potus can pardon anyone including themselves against anything but impeachment.
didn't cameron get photographed eating a hot dog with a knife and fork? still won.
now i want to see a movie were bush and cheney are actual sith lords and scream unlimited power.
arnold is a genuinely nice and intelligent guy from what i gather. trump is... well let's just say he dislikes a lot of people unfairly and is not well informed. that coupled with his tactics and straight up rudeness... i don't like things the way they are. if arnold could be president, i would vote for him over a lot of people.
his debate with sarah palin was also memorable. she tried to claim senator biden didnt know what it was like to be a working class person, and joe masterfully talked about his experiences in being a single dad.
it was a grown man laughing to himself while a child tried to lie about all the amazing things he could do. it was glorious.
"god finally gives shout-out back to all his niggaz"
hmm, so i guess the potus could pretty much do whatever they wanted so long as the house was willing to go along and not impeach them. that's a bit unsettling.
nah, man. bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but he had to go back to his home dimension. he spent the rest of 2016 taking people to live with him.
donald trump was the face of the birther movement for 7 years. it's why he got the nomination in the first place. because he was able to be completely and openly racist and that appealed to enough people.
omg my dad say that believes that michelle is trans woman and that obama is gay. i am like "dad, i am a trans woman, if anyone would know. it would be me. i have excellent trans dar. i can spot on of my people like that. and besides you know how much i would be celebrating if she was." also "if she was that doesnt make him gay, she's a woman, he is a man."
w's whisper campaign in 2000 against mccain was one of the my first steps away from the gop. i was so happy he was nominated in 2008, and i actually had two decent choices for president . . . and then palin happened.
you think you got it bad, i'm currently living abroad in a muslim country and just went back to the us for christmas with my wife to visit her family--a bunch of southern, trump supporters who seemingly do nothing all day but post things to facebook about obama being a secret muslim, or how wind farms will stop the earth from rotating. it was two weeks of them antagonizing my wife and i in every possible way just to goad some debate/fight. one morning i went down to the kitchen to make coffee. no "good morning," no "how did you sleep," just an "obama is smuggling terrorists into the country so there will be an attack during trumps first 100 days." what a great way to start the day.
he called her on her shit, but went a little easier on her. (optics, i guess.) he was relentless with paul ryan. you could see pauly getting flustered. i still laugh when i think about that debate.
holy shit i've never seen this before and that was savage
actually it's because leo won that oscar. it upset the universal laws
someone once said "being black you have to be 200% better just to be seen as normal". i can literally find no fault in the actions of first lady obama while having the seat of first lady. none, her mannerism, etiquette, activities, language, actions are that of the highest caliber of what young women should strive to model themselves after as a role model in both her marriage and her position. and this is the person with more headlines insulting her than any other female person in the world. it truly boggles the mind. if i was in her position, i'd have cursed every single one of you out, twice, on live tv, as obama looked in horror as i let you know just what i think of idiots who don't know anything talking shit about my husband.
i wonder how different the world would have been if mccain had of beat bush in 2000. i think about this a lot. i really think that was a huge dividing line in our history and not a lot of people realize it. maybe decades from now we all will, i dunno.
wait... just real quick... do people really think wind farms will stop the earth from rotating? is that really a thing? my feeds are a nice little bubble of relatively liberal thinkers (i'm from nyc) so i'm incredibly naive when it comes to the levels of stupidity in this country.
wow... that really sucks... i'm sorry and embarrassed that other us citizens do that. i've just stopped having a conversation the moment it goes into a trump argument recently, i just stop and go away. there's no convincing or winning any of those sort of "arguments".
it was a master stroke. ryan came in so far up his own ass believing his bullshit and biden played him like liberace played the ivories. that was and still is how you know a seasoned politician vs a poseur. i would have given anything to see biden square off against the cheeto messiah. biden would have had the stones to know when trump would have rolled out the bullshit half truths and countered it savagely.
i asked my dad why he was hating on her? that she didnt do a thing wrong. that he was only trying to hate on obama. and that it hurt me that you consider her a man. if it was true that she was trans. that shut him up really quick.
i think more people wonder what would have happened if gore hadn't been fucked by the electoral college/biased judges/almost definite floridian vote rigging
but don't you know that they think "clever people" are merely the tools of the devil.
lol. i love how kid one goes into slow clap mode when kid two rolls off as well.
before watching: *wow finally a gif about great mom reflexes* after watching: *oh, okay*
according to people on xbox live, the only strong reflex my mom has is her gag reflex.
slight similar story: i tossed a party for a friend (dani) for her birthday. she ended up getting drunk along with another friend (jess). well i helped dani by holding her up while she puked in my yard. at this time jess stumbled on the other side of me and decided to start her own pile of vomit. i noticed that her hair was getting some extra treatment from the waterfall of vomit so i let go of dani to grab jessica's hair from becoming string candy. but go figure the moment i let go of dani, i noticed in my peripheral that she goes head first into her magical pile. i just let it go and let her accept her own fate and got myself a beer and a bucket of water. the end.
any time that i see 'dad reflexes' it's going to be amazing, and any times i see 'mom reflexes' on this site it's going to be something embarrassing.
didn't even realize he was the cause of the phone at first. this gif is awesome.
not his fault, clearly the first day with his new hands.
that man's arms need to be declared a threat to national security. before we know it his wild flailing will start a nuclear war.
"i'm helping!" "yay. i helped!" "yay! he's picking up a phone a lady dropped."
omg i saw this gif multiple times ...and always thought it was about the baseball player , didnt even notice that guy hahah
you're ridiculously lucky you shut your eye. i have no idea how that would have turned out if you hadn't, but i can't see the idea of blindness in that eye being too farfetched.
that guy clearly doesn't care if he has teeth embedded in the back of his skull.
i thought that was a fake kid until he started moving on the ground
is it just me or is the kid throwing his head every which way, *while getting his head thrown every which way*. like there were some head movements that couldn't have been explained by the jerking alone... seems like a great way to fuck up a neck.
i like how the guy pulled the kid away as if he just rode a bull.
i tried to deep throat a pretty small pickle the other day. it was really hard. i have a new found respect for people that can deep throat.
i have you tagged as being a funny guy and you don't disappoint.
you learn, as a parent, to make a mental note of random things that you don't particularly need right at the moment - i.e. "the other shoe", the game controller they set down the night before, the particular squeak the floor makes next to the snack cabinet, and any number of other objects...makes them think twice about trying to pull a fast one on you.
the computer room, thats cute, i remember when those were a thing.
i like the impressed look on the mother's face. looks like baby number four will come along soon.
even the mom in this case has a hard time fixing the situation after the dad saves the child
can confirm. was working on the car and the gas struts that held up the hood were questionable. daughter had her hands up by the rad. i was turning away when the hood suddenly let go, and out of instinct my arm was under the hood stopping the impending disaster. shoulder got a bit wrenched but my little girl was ok. a few weeks later i had my head near the engine checking something and the hood came down on my head.... can confirm: dad reflexes do not work on dad. went into the house with a headache and ordered a new set of struts. hood now opens itself.
this makes me so fucking angry. what an idiot parent. learn to fucking look both ways.
i feel bad for the kids, they didn't chose to be born by a woman with absolutely zero common sense..
jesus christ. this plays like a fast and the furious movie
and he walked down to get to that row just to touch the player. the guy was a fucking bull in a china shop after he showed up.
it's more than just that, he also drenches a woman with beer at the end too...
yeah this gif is funny, but it also makes me irrationally angry. have some god damn spatial awareness!
same. i've seen this several times and always see comments like "well give him a break he just got his new arms and doesn't know how to use them yet." this whole time i thought that was a bit of an overstatement commenting on how it took the player a couple seconds to pick up the phone.
yeah, luckily i was a huge pussy back then. i still am. but good thing i was then too.
even if the glue didn't cause damage by itself, i'd bet removing it would come with a high risk of doing so.
no, he's fine. they're rubber until they're about 6. but that kid looks like he's 7. he might not be so good at math and reading after that.
the trick is to swallow as you do it. you'll lose the pickle but it's certainly a fast way to eat. source: i'm the only dude i know that can successfully eat a banana in one bite.
sounds like a good way to choke to death on a pickle. seriously, though, don't stick anything small like that inside your body that you'd be upset not to get back if you lost your grip.
lpt: make a really tight fist with your left hand around your thumb (like an idiot might punch). i have no idea how, but it suppresses your gag reflex. i read it a while back and use the trick every morning when i brush my tongue. another slightly farfetched lpt: if you feel like you're about to cry, just spit. it almost instantly eliminates the urge. i think i read that one in a book called sparrow hawk red in like the 4th grade. it's stuck with me ever since.
conversely, as a teenager, i had started catching on to these little things (particularly the noises) and took full advantage. coming home late? don't ever step directly in front of the first stair, step to far right of the second, skip the 3rd entirely, all the way left on the next 3, middle of the next 2, then left, right, and you're on the landing. never ever walk through the middle of the hall way, and when you go to open the door, always gently but firmly pull the knob before turning it so it doesn't make that loud clicking noise.
my roommate loses everything, once i see something i almost always remember where it is. at this point i'm basically his life's search engine - *"alexa, where are my keys?"* *"in the kitchen next to the microwave, dude."*
she's so impressed that she picks the kid up by his leg, then sets him/her down on their head
seriously she's just dangling her by the leg, pull her up!
you should have just wedged a 2x4 in there, you got swindled by the strut industry.
and also don't cross roads between vehicles, where you're damn-near impossible for drivers to see until you're already on the road.
all cars in that street are facing the other way. maybe this guy was going the wrong way in a one way street?
also, if you are going to have a favorite kid, at least be a bit subtler about it.
i feel bad for the older one, mom doesn't care *that much* for her
i saw that part, then when i rewatched it i noticed he also caused the phone fumble.
what episode is this from? i just finished 1-10 on netflix and don't remember this part.
that must be one hell of a trick to show at parties. might bring up some questions though.
damn! thanks dude! i'll give both of those a try.
and now you have a whole set of new tells that your parents already know ;)
it all comes down to looking like you don't care or aren't paying attention but in reality you are watching every move.
"fuck this kid, i want that man's dick in my vagina!"
speaking as a dad, sometimes they're the same thing
well the dad is also like, "my work here is done, do your part." and gives zero fucks
that's what the wife said. but $35 shipped to my door is worth not having to dig around for a piece of wood.
if you back the video waaaay up, he also caused the baseball player to fall into the stands!
dude just walks into the scene and fucks everything up. and cheers about it.
actually she got off super lucky i guess they were small little surface scratches, but would have been worse had she blinked more or rubbed her eye at all
young adults who have their computers in their rooms, i assume. not married people with seperate bedrooms/computer rooms computer rooms were more common or at least seemingly so as kids tend to get computers in their rooms as they grow older
clearly he's a young grandpa. his power was eroded by time seriously though, i wish to not fuck up like that when i become a dad.
i can't imagine the panic until you figured out the kid isn't injured
nah i think its just his back muscles. im a straight man and i took a second to appreciate them.
have a 2 year old. can confirm. takes some practice but you can eventually go into this half-sleep state where you're still monitoring for suspicious movements/sounds/kid trying to kill themselves
isn't it half pretending to sleep to avoid talking to wife?
i was mostly joking. but my genetic makeup is like 40% white trash, so i was at least a little serious
at the beginning of the video he convinces trump to run for president.
that dude definitely cruises down the street at 15mph straddling the lanes and leaves people at red lights all the time. i can feel it.
eyes are tougher than most people think. though nail glue is a bit much.
that how it rolls through my head too. i always thought i'd come off odd explaining the intuitive probabilistic calculations thing but it's exactly how the scenarios play out for me.
probably did it on purpose. kid was probably being a dick. i ain't your dad, kid. sit down or eat pavement. source: uncle
step one. don't let your kid stand up in the fucking stroller.
how can people not die/get paraplegic during that? i think i would certainly be dead after such a feat.
"suspicious sounds" also includes total silence, which usually means something really bad is going on
that part is a few minutes in. if you look closely at the start of the video you can watch as he accidently topples a little kid into the gorilla exhibit at the cincy zoo.
maybe it's just being vaguely scared shitless all the time. the little fuckers spend *all damn day* trying to kill themselves.
that's not quite as bad as what my uncle made me eat.
one time it was because the kid was at the bottom of the pool. it was maybe 3 mins of too quietness. shook the water out of his lungs and now he only has a slightly worse case of autism than he already had. please note, this was not my kid, just my pool, however i no longer bang chicks with kids.
well at least he has an exemplary resume, including being the chief engineer of deepwater horizon.
then you are a half-dead ruin, unable to do anything, sitting on a high-tech throne barely keeping you alive... and slowly failing with every passing century. not to mention you're forced to watch your empire slowly crumble from the inside _and_ outside pressure. and all because you had some shitty sons.
i know it gets said a lot but i'm really surprised how many of us make it to adulthood.
wait a minute, pools give kids the tism? i was told it was only vaccination! my whole world is a lie!
that wasn't his first gig in oil and gas. prior to woking for bp, he was a ship captain for exxon.
yeah but there's a 50/50 chance you're going to ascend to literal godhood after you die. a trillion frenzied worshippers gotta do something to the warp.
he'll eventually learn to pull the trashcan instead of pushing it when he's older and wiser. hopefully in the next few minutes.
that was everything i wanted it to be and more. i would have been satisfied with the 3rd wack to the head but no the kid just had to get blown around too.
i respect his commitment, 12 year old me would have noped back to mom way sooner than that.
inanimate objects piss me off more than anything.
poor guy. looks like the wind kept taking it. thank god no one has me on video trying to wheel two down the driveway at the same time and having them crash horribly into each other.
it's more entertaining to see this kid fight a trashcan than it is to watch a ufc match.
at first i was like "what an idiot." then i was like "he could just pull the damn thing, but at least he's keeping the lid down." then the lid pummeled him again and i started wondering what defect he has. then the damn bin tossed him aside like an apple core and i'm convinced the damn thing is possessed.
i think the question on everyones mind is: where is he going with that. my garbage can voyages are strictly vertical. from to street and return. never lateral. never down the street. seems like this kid is up to no good.
geez, all these people criticizing the kid... he looks to be about *six*. even smart kids aren't great at problem solving at that age. he probably weighs about 45 pounds, and he's dealing with gusts strong enough to blow that trash bin down the street. he's going to go flying regardless of how he tries to move it. the only people to criticize here are the adults not helping him.
what is it with americans and having no plants in their yards it looks creepy and barren to me (im from nz)
i remember when i was this kid's age, and my grandpa asked me to take the trash up to the end of his long driveway. that week's garbage was rather rancid, and the nasty odor was wafting from the can as i pushed it in front of me. i kept stopping every ten feet to force down my gag reflex. after i finally got done and got back into the house, my grandpa was looking at me as if i was 'special'. "you realize you could've just pulled that trashcan behind you, right?" he said in a slow and even tone, and i was so embarrassed i didn't look him in the eyes for the next couple hours. since then, i pull the trash behind me now.
this kids struggle with the trash can reminds me of calvin's (of calvin and hobbes) imaginary battles with his bicycle as he was being forced to learn to ride it.
i never pull these cans by their handles. trashcans with wheels are the bane of my existence.
little guy is dedicated though, if you're gonna be dumb, you better be tough.
mom woulda just told me i don't get no dinner until i get the trashcan back where it belongs. my choice.
12 year old me didn't have a bin with wheels but he was expected to move animal feed with a small tractor and trailer.
i love shit like this. nobody gets hurt (unless pride counts) and everyone can laugh afterwards.
yup. that trashcan was really dedicated to wrecking that little kid.
you're doing it wrong. you've gotta side step while pushing one and pulling the other. keep them away from each other.
the kid was no match against the trash cans superior striking ability and ground game. it completely can-handled him.
my buddies and i went camping on a windy weekend in the appalachian mountains. watching my buddy trying his hardest to put up a tent on a windy day was so entertaining. friends will help each other. real friends will motivate the other friend's struggle while having a laugh at his expense.
see the wind ? it blew his can down the street, now he has to bring it back home. source : 45 degree street denizen
strictly vertical? what's your maximum altitude? how high would you say you are right now?
it looks like a new neighborhood. here in the states suburbia is a real thing... fewer people live in urban city centers, everyone's moving into the suburbs. the suburbs are frequently built with dozens or hundreds of new homes at a time built on old farmland. the grass is rolled out onto the lawn using sod. there is a tree sapling on the parkway, odds are 50% it'll survive though. in the usa there's very few laws or restrictions preventing developers from buying up large swaths of farmland and building a few dozen homes. there's no population requirements, nothing says there needs to be a need for new homes. if this neighborhood is still around in 20-30 years it'll likely have more trees, bushes, etc.
here's a dumber story to make you feel better. my uncle once asked my cousin to put a bunch of sugar packets in a glass container for a babyshower.... 20 minutes later he checked on him and saw that my cousin had seriously spent 20 minutes opening all of the packets and emptying them into the container. he was 23 years old.
my grandpa would let me fail. then he'd show me where i failed. i always knew when i saw him repressing laughter, i was in for a lesson. he was never mean about it, but i didn't make the same mistake twice. as an adult, i wish i had that guidance. i'd still be removing 87 tool bars from ie every week, but it'd be worth it.
or charlie brown's kite, or trying to kick the football!
after seeing your username, i'll bite. explain more?
i thought the same, kid stuck it out to the bitter end.
i was actively rooting for the wind. i'm a horrible person.
i had that same choice, but unfortunately for me i was a willful little shit. i went without food for a day and a half until my mom finally gave in and i got to wear my light up shoes and and batman shirt to school.
12 year old me would've loved a tractor. instead i got to buy my own shit.
after reading this comment i was like "man.. that's a little harsh. you don't even kno- oooh, heh heh. that's clever."
unless the person being scared freaks out and punches/attacks them out of fright or natural reflexes. in high school we had a teacher with ptsd. a kid didn't know this and snuck up behind him, teacher ended up punching kid in face.
i'm trying to figure out how to get three. i can tilt one and push that one and tilt another to drag behind that one and put in the left hand. last i grab the third and drag on my right, but if i hit any snags i am a goner.
[-----------------------------------------] bout this high
i rather enjoy that both of these stories have the older, wiser person wait until the child has finished doing the whole damn thing backwards before offering a better solution. it's the gentle malice of age.
haha...yeah, pretty much every kid had dumbass moments like these growing up. it's just a matter of learning these lessons the first time to make sure we fuck it up less next time.
the fuckers just never roll straight. when you pull by the handle the can goes where ever the wheels want it to go. i always just manhandled them from the front. that and like in the gif the lid always finds a way to smack you in the face. and when the wheels inevitably fall off the cans always fall down. and people being cheap they just prop it up with a brick or try to "fix" them.
maybe it got blown down the street and he had to go get it?
everyone is calling him dumb but he's stealing those cans to sell profit
as a parent, i can say: kids usually only cry when being watched.
kid's not dumb, he's a kid. with more determination than most adults i know these days.
dumb enough that he can't figure out to turn that thing around and pull it behind with the wind keeping the lid closed.
look at this 1%er with his light up shoes. if i wanted light up shoes mom woulda told me to find some lightening bugs and smash 'em up on my feet.
damn it seems like it might be really hard to get out on your own
i thought everybody watched george lopez? i used to love that shit back in my day
my daughter's ex bf really like to scare people, a lot. my daughter has ptsd and other issues, so she didn't like it when he did it. one day, he got her really good in the bathroom. she just laid down on the floor and had a full on panic attack with crying and screaming. the ex bf initially just stood there for a moment, not understanding what just happened before he tried to console her.
it gives you a frame of reference for the lesson. source have kids if i tell them a better way they wont listen let them bust thier ass doing it the hard way then tell them. next time they are doing it the right way.
live in an area with high winds. high winds and they will go until they get stuck up against something. whoa to you if the wind is blowing from your house across an empty corn field that has been harvested. your bin will be on the far side of the field.
so you wouldn't have turned the trash can around and *pulled* it either?
you try thinking on your feet when you keep getting whacked on the head like that.
remember you are looking at it from the outside. in his shoes you have to deal with anger + frustration which cloud better judgment (and hence the learning process)
look at this guy with his fancy mom. if i'd wanted a mom the cops would have told me to go hug a pile of bark.
just gotta elevate yourself with your elbows a bit, then grip the edges with your inner knees and pull yourself out with your hands. probably really easy for a slim and flexible kid actually
maybe it's just because me and my family are mexican, but i never even considered that people may not have watched that show.
so wait. that wasn't the first time? and he knew she didn't like it. wow, no wonder it's ex.
yup. that's how my father did it too. smash your thumb with the hammer, "i warned ya, that's why i said hold it this way."
i'm still somewhat confused... unless he didn't have a dust pan.
i suspect that the word you were looking for there is "woe" rather than "woah". :-)
you make it sound like he's in a high pressure situation. he has tons of time to think about what's going on here.
this is reddit so we have a lot of armchair specialists in all sorts of areas, including but not limited to trashcan pushing.
actually i did have a mom but bark is funnier
the more likely situation is he just tips the thing over
i mean, my wife hates to be tickled but that doesn't mean i'm not going to do it...
i do the same with my kids. i'll tell them the right way, they'll insist they know better. i say "fine, go ahead. do it your way. don't come crying to me if you get hurt." then it fails miserably in exactly the way i told them it would. moral of the story: mama's always right!
sounds like he was pushing it out the door. started with right at the door and pushed some out and then kept backing up a little and pushing more.
care to fill the rest of us informed folk in on it?
have you learned nothing?! you should pull the trashcan...
but he doesn't really have much room to shift his weight and it's on wheels.
i just now realized why you crochet instead of knit
right?! every time i tickle your wife she'll yell but deep down we both know she likes it
go to the r/todayilearned subreddit, some japanese spirit named betobeto or whatever it is was the topic of a top post from there
you guys are assholes. i tickled /u/obliterayte's wife *once*, and she told me she hated it, so i stopped. i haven't done it since. i'm a great guy.
look at this guy with his "awkward" social interactions. in my day...
very nice gesture and farewell. i hope y'all use and enjoy those. my great grandmother was also a quilter. one of my most prized/sentimental possessions is a quilt she gave me, the last one she made for all i know. every time i use it it makes me a little sad, but also weirdly happy that i have something to remember her by and to keep me warm when i need it.
my grandmother made afghans for all her kids and grandkids for when they were married. the year before she died she gave me mine saying "i give up waiting."
what you see here is a collection of what a lot of people would place pretty high on a "what to grab" list in the event of a fire. my grandma wasnt so much a quilter but she loved crocheting and her blankets were always a favourite gift for her 50+ family members (the lucky few that is.) when she passed away in 2013 and it came time to clean out her room at the nursing home it was a pretty special gift to find that she had one baby blanket tucked away in a bag under the bed with my name on it. that was always a gift and she definitely gave dozens of baby blankets to my cousins over the years. she wanted to make sure that, although i had yet to have kids, there would be one for me as well. i don't plan on having any, so i've put it in my will to take that blanket with me when i finally kick it. i am sure those quilts will be well cared for and will likely outlive all of us
daaaaum quilting is hard! that's an amazing accomplishment, and very neat way to celebrate it.
my grandma was undergoing chemo and her church group took turns knitting a prayer blanket for her (praying for her as they knitted). i got it after she died and wrap myself in it whenever i need to find some peace. i'm sorry for your loss but cherish your quilt!
100 for every special occasion? so she had like 2 million of those puppies?
i received an embroidered table cloth from my grandma a week before i married. with it was a note she written in 1975 the year i was born. in the letter she apologized that she probably wouldn't be there. she had died when i was 10.
this is so beautiful. my grandmother is also a quilter and she tried desperately to get me into it as a teenager. she owned a shop and would have me come and work there. i hated it. now, twenty years later, i'm super interested in quilting, but she's too tired to really teach me anything. it's one of the greatest regrets of my life. i'm definitely going to suggest placing her quilts out for display when that sad time comes (it's not too far away). also, i really love your username.
i have several quilts made by my grandma, her sisters and my great grandmother. as they got older, the workmanship went down a bit and some of the color combos are interesting to say the least but i treasure them knowing that this is a tangible connection to women no longer here. i even have a patchwork quilt made entirely of polyester squares that was made by my grandmother in the late 60s/early 70s that is still in daily use (ugly as hell but super warm).
condolences for the loss. my mum died last week as well. it's weird. hope you guys are doing ok and remembering the good times.
hahahaha, luckily i've already got my wedding date picked out! we picked what we thought was a random date about a week before her passing. coincidentally, it was also her and my late grandfathers wedding anniversary. really amazing how these things seem to work out.
my grandma passed a couple of weeks ago and one of the last things that she said to my girlfriend was that she was sad that she wouldn't see us get married. of course my girlfriend was happy to hear that she wanted us to get married, but it was also my grandma's not so subtle way of lighting a fire under my ass to tie the knot. well played, grandma.
i'm imagining what it'd feel like if right now i looked over at a chair in my single-occupancy apartment and saw my dead grandma's "for when you get married" quilt.
a quick read through the headline made it sound like she had 104 unmarried grandchildren.
i have two, which i treasure dearly! she was truly an amazing woman and i am reminded of her every day when i look on my couch and see my beautiful quilts!
it's amazing, isn't it. the thing is that if you were to ask someone what they thought of their handywork most would scoff at the idea that what they do to simply pass the time could become something so valuable to a family. your great grandmothers hands were all over that quilt... to think of the time she would have spent sitting there working on it... the frustration she would have felt fixing an error... what her thoughts were about who she thought would end up with it... daydreaming fantasy dreams as she toiled away.. what they would have been. there is life in that quilt that most would never understand and she probably didn't either when she was putting it there to begin with.
i'd hate to be the one grandchild who doesn't end up getting married ever
my grandmother passed away in december also at the age 84. she was also an avid traveler and cross stitched instead of making quilts. i bet our grandmas are hanging out in heaven with each other swapping stories and having a grand old time... my thoughts are with you and your family.
just curious do you know where in upstate ny? im from there as well and just curious if its a name i would know lol
yeah, my grandma made us a wedding quilt, one of the last that she made. only my sister and cousin got one after us, she just can't spend the hours hunched over it anymore and her vision isn't good enough. i would immediately grab that quilt, no question about it. the last quilt she made was with my aunt, taking favorite t-shirts from another aunt who had recently died. i've never seen people crying like my cousin was when they gave it to her. quilts are great, the time they take really lets you know how much you mean to the maker.
that's so sweet. my babysitter (who was like another mother to me) had stomach cancer and she would sew little pillows and crocheted two little blankets for me. they are a few of my most prized possessions. i was only 3 when she passed but i've never forgotten her for a day. i remember going to her funeral with mini pink carnations. i wish she could have seen me grow up.
aww that's so sweet that she saved one for you. this thread has me crying.
that's an amazing gift. she must have loved you very much. were you very surprised when you received it?
going to be rough on your partner though, going through life wondering if the affection is real or if they were just the key to getting the sweet quilt. "sure, tits_mcgheee says 'i love you' often enough... but now that i think about it, have they ever said it outside of the room with the quilt?"
i've recently started to live alone and my grandma has recently started to cry about how she misses me... even though i only live 15 minutes away and visit every two days. i said to her, "grandma, what are you going to do when i get married and move away?? then we'll barely see each other" her sad expression changed in a moment and she tsked, "you think i'm going to live long enough to see you get marrried? pfffft" and rolled her eyes. wat
that's awesome! i'm glad to hear you actively use yours too. for a while i had it kept away for fear of it getting damaged. then i realized she would have wanted me to use it.
this is so wonderful. quilting is an expensive and time-consuming hobby, and many quilters only gift quilts to those they love and know will cherish how much love and effort was put into the quilt. i'm so sorry for your loss, op, and hope her quilts bring you some comfort.
in sure she is proud of the person you have become, /u/tits_mcgheee
may i ask what nationality/ethnicity she was? my armenian grandmother used to make similar quilts and also made 5 for us unmarried grand kids. thank you for your post!
this... so much this. my grandmother made quilts for everything it seemed. she would do various kinds and different thickness. when we moved to our new house, she had me bring the color swatches i had picked for my bedroom and made me a special quilt. it was a summer quilt that i spent many a hot night huddled under because it was the only blanket that breathed. i feel so happy to have those quilts - and when i have kids i'll gladly pass them down.
haha, well fortunately after a while the kids double as farm help.
my grandmother passed last week at the age of 84. i'm one of 10 grands who each have a quilt. if these other two grandmothers are anything like mine, then i'm sure they're laughing, telling amazing stories about everything, and sharing a margarita.
morristown, new york. a tiny little town on the st. lawrence river bordering canada.
well you grew up having had that influence. out of all the people we meet in a lifetime not many have the staying power to find their way into the minds of strangers on random days in random corners. her life was so bright that even now after all this time she remains relevant. she may not have a physical body and i am not one to believe in any of the afterlife type stuff, but i do believe that just by you disclosing that info and how it will play into the rest of my day is indeed, in a way, life purest. she may not have seen you grow up but you grew up to who you are as a result of her still being with you... and i imagine she always will be. i love carnations.. my fav actually.
i want to cry, but i can't. i have dry eyes ( really, no kidding)
yea i cried esp when i realized she wouldn't be there for the wedding.
i'm a quilter and can absolutely say, no matter how plain or fancy a quilt that i gift is, i gift them to be used. i expect baby quilts to be worn out, holes worn in them, the fabric to be stained. i expect wedding quilts to be loved, the couple snuggling together or separately or with the family pets. i tell everyone i give a quilt to that if their quilt needs some kind of extensive repair, to return it to me and i will figure out a way to keep life in their quilt. :)
my family actively uses almost every quilt we have. my sister and i actually only sleep with quilts instead of other blankets. and all our quilts are family made from great grandma to grandma to mom all being pretty good seamstresses. i can tell you without a doubt that that quilts given to family are meant to be used. when they wear out turn them into decoration or get them patched.
if you have more than one, put one of them away in a safe place. my great grandmother knitted me a quilt that i used for years. it eventually disintegrated and now i have nothing. i wish i would have saved a piece of it.
i've gotten into quilting, though just lap quilts so far. it makes me nuts when people say they're too pretty to use. i cross-stitched a quilt top for my niece when she was about two and my sister instantly put it away 'so it wouldn't get messed up.' my niece is in her early 20s now and i don't think she ever used it.
that is very sweet that she did that, but as a person who is not planning on ever getting married i would be very sad if i couldn't have my quilt lol.
it really does lend to those who say a handmade gift is best. i am thinking case closed. it makes me wonder what future generations will hold onto, if anything, that could possibly compare. i usually give the standard gift card type gift but somehow i don't see my little niece one day in the future coming across a macy's gift card and having a sudden sense memory of her dearly departed... as she sits on the floor of her attic with legs crossed pressing the ancient retail gift card to her face while thinking she can still smell me on it before neatly placing it back into the chest where it was found knowing it will be safe... clearly, i need to take up handwork.... for the sake of the warm fuzzies i am robbing from the ones i love long after i am gone
so what you're saying is, to make my life easier i need to have 2 more kids? well alright then.
you can't cry ever? do you tear up with a cold wind in your face? what about spicy food? or you dog getting run over?
growing up we had a bunch of quilts from my grandmother and i had no idea that they were special. we hammered them as kids, like rub on concrete abuse and they were indestructible, just iron. several times when we went to see them she would fix them and we would carry on. i love that you are keeping the tradition alive. awesome. :)
my mother in law gave us a quilt over thanksgiving that my husbands great grandmother hand sewed. when we got home, he went to throw it on the bed, and i immediately freaked out. the idea of my dog laying on a 100 year old quilt makes me want to cry.
i can't wait to have someone in my life who is a quilter. i want to learn so badly.
you sound like one of my ex girlfriend's best friends.
not to derail, but after getting this far, the word quilt looks really weird
it disintegrated before you could save a piece? i am unfamiliar with the physics of quilts.
this is exactly what happens to me. i make something cool for someone in my family and it goes into a drawer and is forgotten about. i'm sure they don't realize how much more insulting that is than just letting it get worn and ruined. i don't even make things for anyone anymore. like, i didn't put hours into something for it to be looked at once and put away.
i'm slowly nearing the point where i'll have kids. how are you finding two? as hard as poster above makes it out? we are thinking either one or two.
i am indian, we eat spicy food for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. not crying. do you want me to get my dog run over, just to find out if i can cry or not? cold wind? i live in the tropics. sorry buddy, i can't help you.
haha for me basically any life event merits a quilt. "oh, you've got your own place now? quilt!" "you got a new job? quilt!" you get a quilt and you get a quilt! ;)
find a local quilt shop! the one near me is always having beginner classes, i think they even let you use machines they have there (they are located inside a sew-and-vac shop, so it is pretty convenient). and i think i've seen them through our local parks and rec center too? but i'm completely self-taught, from youtube and blogs and stuff.
the way i started was i bought a yard of one color, another yard of another color, cut them into squares and sewed them together. get a couple yards for the back and some natural batting for the center...it's easier than the fluffy stuff. start sewing. you first quilt or two will be lumpy, bumpy, lopsided, and odd. someone will still love it. it will still be warm. never be intimated by someone else's quilts.
i think it's a pretty common sentiment among us quilting folks. :)
damn him/her for asking all the wrong questions. now my lazy ass has to go look up dry eyes.
this right here. my family are all big quilters. i have about 20 and all were gifted for some reason or another. my mum has cancer and already quilted 4 baby quilts before she passes, just incase i have 4 kids, i said what if i have 5? to which she replied, 'you're an idiot if you have more than two, so i made you 4, even you are not dumb enough to have 5." needless to say a sense of humor also runs in the family.
i once went with one of my library volunteers to a quilt show in fort worth. i can see how owners would be a bit timid to use such beautiful pieces of art. the truth is though they are even more beautiful when loved and utilized. i'm glad quilt makers emphasize this notion.
carrie fisher on death in an interview last month: rolling stone: do you fear death? carrie: no. i fear dying. anything with pain associated with it, i don't like. i've been there for a couple of people when they were dying; it didn't look like fun. but if i was gonna do it, i'd want someone like me around. and i will be there!
damn. after all that work to get herself healthy. this sucks.
i was just watching her on a christmas special episode of qi or 8 out of 10 cats, one of the british christmas panel specials filmed a few days ago and she seemed so lively and full of humor. it's depressing to think that someone who appeared so healthy could die so suddenly. seeing her in interviewed in the uk, where she was flying from, and talking about her plans to see her mom on christmas is just heartbreaking.
she has become more powerful than you could possibly imagine
really sad. i was hoping she would pull through. i'm just happy she was able to partake in the new star wars before she passed. we are really packing in the celebrity deaths at the end of the year. rip
she was the most funny person. a few years ago i met her at the star wars celebration. it was the last day, on the last hour of the event and i was the last one in a queue to get her autograph. as i was about to greet her, someone tapped on my shoulder, it was femi tayler, the dancing twi'lek, asking me if she could get before me and hug carrie. they were so happy to see each other it was a real pleasure to witness that. a few minutes later, still very happy, carrie fisher greeted me with a huge grin and, pushing a box of cookies, told me to take one. as i politely declined, she waved her hand like a jedi and told me "you want to take a cookie". all my friends over there were jealous beyond measure and i still cherish the memory. today we didn't lose the princess of alderaan, we lost the princess of our hearts.
obviously star wars, but also the blues brothers. when harry met sally. and my favorite underrated movie, the burbs. rip carrie fisher.
only 60. she's been around for so long that i assumed she was older. at the very least, you can say that she was someone who definitely lived life to the fullest.
this sucks. she led a wild life, but still too soon. was she going to be included in episode 8?
she died the way we should all hope to die: shortly after telling the world she banged harrison ford in his prime.
one of the first true female heroines. she and mark made star wars and the force what it is. sad sad day indeed. may the force be with her forever.
as an aside: credit to reddit algorithms, this post shot up so fast that i found out about this news here first. rip carrie fisher :(
she was the first person to make me feel comforted in having bipolar disorder. she went through the same things i had: drugs, sex, compulsive behavior, suicidal tendencies. after getting diagnosed i searched the internet often, looking for someone who thought like me, that i could relate too. i came across an article titled something like "celebrities with bipolar disorder" and there she was. carrie fisher was not only diagnosed but she was an activist for mental health awareness. i finally felt normal again know that someone i had already loved had gone through the same things i was currently struggling with. thank you carrie fisher, you are a wonderful woman. may the force be with you, always.
find david attenborough, and keep him safe. he **must** make it through!
while sad, it's unsurprising. depending on where you look the survival for an out of hospital cardiac arrest is about 10-12%.
sigh. i knew this was coming but it still sucks. as someone with bipolar disorder, i really looked up to her.
in a way the ending of rogue 1 is now a nice memorial to her in the star wars films. ______________________________ **may the force be with her!**
if i was a celebrity the next four days would be spent in a bunker with a team of doctors.
she is one with the force and the force is with her. rip.
god this year is just shit. and her poor therapy dog. i know that probably sounds stupid, but she took him everywhere. that poor thing is going to miss her probably more than all of her fans combined. rip princess leia.
am i a terrible person for wondering how this'll affect episode 9? unless they already killed her off in 8.
amazing actress, will be missed. just goes to show what a "stable" condition really means...
my favorite baseball team wins a world series for the first time since the jurassic period and then the whole world goes down the tubes. what an insanely peculiar year
is this confirmed? i can't find anything else besides this article from people.com.
my thoughts exactly, she really got in shape compared to how she looks in older photos.
aw, this comment section actually made me a little happier. thanks, reddit.
she'll be in the upcoming episode 8 as well, it wrapped filming.
ya i wasn't holding breath when i heard "stable" since she had gone so long without oxygen. still so sad...
i think they finished filming 8, it's possible this will cause problems for 9.
from what i've heard, her part has already been filmed.
me too, there were articles today about how her mother said she's stable. this is heartbreaking :'(
she was my first hero. as a little girl, obsessed with star wars, leia was everything i wanted to be. and as i got older and learned more about carrie and her life i really did admire her as a person, not just the character she played. rip carrie.
usually my front page is full of things that are hours old, i saw this less than 10 minutes of it being posted.
really? i am still not seeing in on the front page of r/all edit - guys it changed really quick. i went through two pages of r/all and then had to go to r/news to find it. by the time i commented and checked back it was working its way up r/all
i was just floored as a teenager to read that this beautiful icon, that she had similar problems to me. the sex, the substance abuse, the manias, the lows, the knee jerk reactions..... hers was the first book i read where i felt, "wow, there are people who understand, who go through it, too," and was enamored with the fact that she was a movie star as well (not that this was the important part, it was just that, i always felt it would be impossible to achieve any level of success). i just threw out/burned all my cigarettes. i know that her smoking wasn't quiiiiiiite the reason, given her insane coke use, but this was a wake up call for me. her family and dog are going to miss her terribly, and i am finally at a place where i don't want to be dead, and i think my presence would be missed if i were gone. i care about myself more, but the smoking has to go.
episode 8 finished filming in july. you'll see leia on the big screen a year from now.
just go basejumping in a squirrel suit in high winds. obviously death is picking off people with no rhyme or reason.
i reckon the queen will die on new years eve for the big finale
i thought that too. poor gary. he won't understand where his human went.
wondered about that too. they'll have to make it so she passed off camera or something to that extent, i imagine. so sad. . .
if they could recreate young leia in rogue one i'm sure they can cg an old one.
exactly. stable doesn't mean likely to survive- it just means you aren't actively dying. says nothing of her actual condition. she has been "stable" for the last 2 days, but i assume "stable" with severe brain deterioration due to lack of oxygen.
i've seen in the last 24 hours: stable, critical, stable, and now deceased? what?
i think role models that beat personal and life demons are more of a role model than someone who has always been perfect.
sadly your body doesn't forget, alcohol drugs and whatever can do serious damage even after being sober for many years.
they'll probably find a way to retire her like with paul walker
the year after, even worse. the celebrities/musicians/whatever a lot of us grew up with, are all reaching that age range.
me too. maybe i was 10 or so when i first saw those movies? she was amazing. i was so sick of disney-type princesses and damsels in distress that it was so refreshing to see her be that character. to know there were women out there like that. that we don't need to be rescued, we can save ourselves. ugh, incredible, goosebumps just thinking about it.
yes filming finished a long time ago. as for episode 9...
i keep thinking about her little dog too. she took him everywhere. he must be so confused.
she was down for more like 30 minutes. paramedics did cpr on the tarmac for 15 minutes before getting a pulse. passengers on the plane were working on her for 10-15 minutes *before* that. she wasn't going to make it.
as depressing as this news is, other than a spectacular recovery, it's probably the best outcome. i'd much rather hear that she passed peacefully instead of being kept alive for months on machines or waking up severely brain damaged/a vegetable. it is a terrible loss of a great actress.
she was absolutely hilarious on the latest 8 out of 10 cats panel show.
yup. that's why more people need to learn cpr and there need to be aeds (automatic defibrillators) nearby. every percent that number goes up represents real lives.
if leia dies in episode 8, that's going to be hard to handle.
agreed. she was always open about her inner demons and is an inspiration to a lot of people
"death is just another path, one that we all must take"
they might cg her death for a short scene or something. rogue one already showed that disney are not afraid to do that.
that would feel sacreligious just one year later.
yes, it just means she wasn't constantly coding or needed doctors actively working on her to save her life.
made me think of this from skyrim paarthurnax: what is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?
i had to break up with a girl, in part, because she didn't understand how serious cocaine use was. she just kept saying that she would stop eventually and her body would recover. she was stuck in the "it won't happen to me" mentality.
yeah people seem to be forgetting that heart disease is one of the leading causes of death regardless of drug use. diet, exercise, and genetics are just as important, if not more.
holy shit. not one, but two pacemaker jokes in this episode.
that's what pisses me off about all these people saying "stop making references for karma! shejust died". carrie fisher was a cynical asshole who joked about everything and gave no fucks. she would love seeing all this love and attention she is getting and how many people she impacted. but no. we just have to be miserable. fuck that fake bullshit. i'm sad, but i'm going to remember carrie for her great words and the life she led. i'm not going to mope around spouting out fake bullshit sadness.
my guess is if she's alive at the end if 8, they'll have princess leia die at the start of 9.
there going to play "see you again" as she street races vin diesel in to the sunset?
carrie fisher and george michael weren't really in the age range. they died fairly young
this times a million - i always saw her as the first woman who showed me how awesome strong women could be.
to be fair, she looked and acted a lot more mature. when i think of the 19 year olds i know, most still look and act like children.
she may have been killed off in episode viii, they'll pull a paul walker and she'll be killed off screen, or they've already finished filming what they needed for episode ix for her as well as viii. with a series as big and old as star wars is, i think they've made sure to get all the shots they need from the original cast.
you're right, even in the best case scenario fisher's entire chest would have been splintered and she would likely have significant brain damage. the people that were talking about her "getting better quickly and making movies again" don't seem to grasp how bad dying and coming back to life is for your health.
yep. i saw so many people getting excited about that on fb and i didn't want to be a debbie downer but i had a feeling she wasn't going to pull through.
i hope he got to say goodbye. animals, especially dogs, can be devastated when they don't realize where their friends have gone.
that's almost why i'm so surprised, there are aeds in most major public areas these days (airports, venues, schools, etc.). the fact that the number is still so low despite that...i mean do people not know how to use them? worse yet, do they not know where they are? i'm not sure if i'd be able to find one in a state of extreme panic.
after....who dies in episode 7 (i'm not going to openly post that spoiler, just in case), i don't think leia was going to die in 8. i think she was actually going to have a pretty important role in the next 2 movies considering who kylo ren is....(yet again, not openly posting spoilers) i figure lucasfilms has some sort of contingency plan in place, but it's still going to alter episode 9 and potentially even beyond.
pippin: i didn't think it would end this way. gandalf: end? no, the journey doesn't end here. death is just another path, one that we all must take. the grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it... pippin: what? gandalf? see what? gandalf: white shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. pippin: well, that isn't so bad. gandalf: no... no, it isn't.
would probably be seen as poor taste so soon after her passing to do something like that. will more than likely be an off camera death.
people is actually a very responsible publication known to treat subjects with dignity.
i would imagine they were one of the outlets who had a reporter hanging around the hospital. tmz also carried the news right away.
i don't know. it sounds, if you reverse it, he's implying that just because i never was evil, was brought up a good person and stood by my beliefs, i'm somehow *worse* than a person who did some bad stuff but then was really sorry about it.
well you can't change the past. congrats on choosing a better future though.
despite that sadder news, many congratulations to you for the 3 years of sobriety! that's a huge feat and i really commend you for it.
me too. alcoholic for 25+ years. sober 2. started to get myself in shape 1.5 years ago and had a fucking heart attack 11 months ago (jan 25th). take care of yourselves when you're young.
i think this is something people don't understand about cocaine very well. it's incredibly destructive to your cardiovascular system and prolonged use can easily cause irreparable damage.
had a friend in law school who smoked reds and said as long as she quits by 35 the negative effects disappear by 40. denial.
that's funny. most girls i've been with that had a cocaine problem go all crazy defensive when you bring up thier destructive habbit. left my first wife over this.
and a "whats the alternative to "waking up on christmas morning"? not waking up on christmas morning??" joke...
eh, the cgi needs to improve somewhat. it hit the uncanny valley way too hard for me.
i think that's the last thing they'll do; they'll probably wanna draw as little attention to it as possible. but yeah, i have no idea how they are going to do episode 9 now, especially since she was probably going to be pretty instrumental in kylo's redemption:(
carrie fisher is the first character i remember being stronger than the male "lead". as a boy at a young age it left a huge impression on me and i'm sure countless others. fuck fuck fuck 2016.
it's her father who was real trouble. guy was a major player in the empire.
it is an unfortunate state of affairs, but not all that rare, both my grandmothers outlived my parents.
even if she had made it, she most likely would never have made another movie... there's no guarantee she'd even ever be aware of who she was ever again...
but it's not always that way. my 80 year old grandmother had a heart attack and died for 30 minutes. she was brought back and lived for 5 more years without any sort of change to her health. she might be a rare case but there are no difinitives in medicine.
agreed. i expect the same with anton yelchin's role in trek. no easy way to do it... :-(
i believe disney if they did this, would ask the family's permission first. it's only the right thing to do if that's the direction they want to go
you could say that, yes, being brought up good & sticking to your beliefs might be morally superior. but i think that consciously overcoming evil puts you in a position of experience, one that might help you consistently make the right decisions in the future. i would even argue that everyone is equally susceptible to evil, and a perfect record might just suggest that you haven't been properly tested just yet.
thank you! i owe it all to my wife. falling in love with her gave me a reason to live a real life.
yeah i only lasted three days last time i tried to quit.
absolutely. i have only ran one legit cocaine overdose and it was so different than any other overdose patient i have cared for. the heart doesn't forget. it adapts to what you do to it. that is why some marathon runners have cardiomegaly
"as long as i quit meth by june i'll have plenty of time for all my teeth to grow back"
i used to make excuses like this when i was smoking. "your lungs restore themselves in 7 years after quitting." and shit like that. so many long-term factors.
wow, had to leave a fiancee because she couldn't give it up, even after having the "i want children" talk with me. it was kinda crazy, all i wanted was 6 months sober from coke before we had a kid, and she went full on crazy like i was asking for the moon. 3 years earlier she had spent almost a year in rehab. fucking nuts when you can't see the forest for the trees.
i was really impressed, thought it was another actor in facial prosthetics until i saw him speak. those subtle mouth/facial movements are really hard to do correctly.
i feel racing chewbacca on speeder bikes would be more fitting
i'll be honest, it makes me happy she got to be in the last star wars before she went. i didn't like it, but i will always remember her as the leia from the originals.
he looked good for cgi. didn't even remotely look real, though.
one of my grandmas had one son estranged, lost another son to cancer just a few months ago, and is losing her third son to cancer, my father. shit sucks. :/
yeah she was pretty much dead for 30 minutes on the plane while waiting for paramedics. machines could keep her heart pumping, but her functioning life was already over.
i wouldn't be surprised if they write him off as accepting a promotion on another vessel. i don't think it's necessary to kill off his character.
counterpoint: a perfect record might mean that i passed the test every time, while the other thing means that i failed at least once but then got better.
can you explain how it was different to other overdoses?
"meth mouth" is a result of poor dental hygiene and food choices, not necessarily meth itself. meth can cause dry mouth and clenched teeth like many other things, however these can be mitigated. it's important to know that the idea that you will most surely have meth mouth if you use meth at all is a falsehood perpetuated by the government and other anti-drug organizations. i do not support meth use, but even with meth, one of the most destructive recreational drugs, there is still a difference between use and abuse.
from experience: it is very difficult as a health professional to explain to people that *everyone's* lung function deteriorates after roughly age 25 and that smoking accelerates this many times. if you stop, your lung function will still have declined much more in the time you smoked, and the only thing you as a smoker can do is to stop today, not in 5 or 10 years.
well, your lungs do eventually get back to a more "normal" state, but there is plenty of damage done as well, depending on how much and for how long.
they already shot episode viii, so she will be in another one.
he looked pretty damn real to me. i didn't even realize he was cg until i read about it. i think if you go in knowing he's cg then you just look for the flaws and find them.
especially when colbert says "why now?" and she basically says " well, years from now i might have alzheimers and not remember everything." i teared up hearing her say that.
hell, dont even start. stop before you begin. i am waiting on a fucking mri result on my liver and lungs. i smoked for 7 years. 7 friggin years. that was it. i quit over a year ago. i am 28 waiting on a scan for cancer, a possiblity discovered in a routine physical. i have 3 kids. i may have to leave them behind because i used to 'enjoy a smoke'. don't. fucking. smoke.
i think the big problem is there are all those carcinogens. even if you return to normal lung function cancer may occur.
i 100% did not know and noticed immediately. i thought leia looked great until she moved her mouth.
she stopped breathing for ~15 minutes just before the plane landed. a bystander performed cpr until they touched down. so even if the cpr held her long enough for paramedics to take her to the icu, that's still a long time for the brain to go without oxygen. what /u/pepeparty was saying is that even though the icu may have kept her heart beating and bodily functions working, her brain was most likely toast. she most likely would have been in a coma/vegetative state for the rest of her life.
the point of cpr is to supply the brain with oxygen. but really, it can only do so much.
they don't remember, because most of the interview was retconned.
credit to graham norton not changing the set even a little in 3-4 years. also, jackman had time to shave.
i love that first interview. its just two irishman a scotsman and australian getting drunk and telling stories
two generations of phenomenonal actors. oh and wolverine who transcends time and space. must be that healing factor in his aussie blood.
credits to graham norton for being consistently great and involved host whilst still being unobtrusive. it's always nice to watch his show.
the cup of juice turned to wine? that must be our lord and xavier christ.
oh wow! two front page posts about x-men? you'd think an x-men movie was out or somethin'!
2 hugh jackman posts at the top of the front page. looks like just another day of reddit being purchased
he's pulling a tom haverford and always walking on a red carpet.
for us filthy casuals, why is it he can't walk again? surely tony stark or the like could hook him up with some shit-kicking bionics if he asked.
to be fair, they've made the backdrop appear to be seamless. jackman still has the same drink, nice.
if you loved the first interview, holy shit the new one is so fucking great.
it's fun conversation without shoving your nose up the stars ass. that's the problem with american late night shows.
it looks like magneto did a magic trick by making his orange juice disappear and ian mckellen is like "are you not impressed?" but patrick stewart is all like "pssh, watch me make this wine that used to be orange juice disappear."
those two seriously have the greatest bromance ever. of all time.
he gave hugh jackman a similar hug/kiss/butt pat on the show in op.
ian mckellen and patrick stewart might as well be at this point. their friendship is like that of an old married couple.
he's actually wearing my high schools prefect tie.
great, then those of us who don't browse twitter get to enjoy it as well!
what do you mean, those are a tom haverford original. 1 of a limited 10 run of shoes. very exclusive.
highjacking a top comment to point out this is the fifth hugh jackman/wolverine related post to hit the top 5 spot on the front page in the past two days the logan marketing team is currently running reddit, i just thought i'd point out how easy it is for this to happen. this and a til post about hugh jackman are literally the top two on the front page right now, and it was similar yesterday
it doesn't count as manspreading if the guy is hot.
what a world we live in where you have to put that disclaimer in.
if i remember correctly they get to select their own drinks (with alcohol if they want, there have been really drunk guests on the show).
wow. first time in my life this movie was referenced by anyone outside my buddy who i saw it in theatres with. the reference is good, too...which is really crazy! anyway, i have a theory that hugh jackman doesn't make good movies unless he's wolverine, and the fountain has a lot to do with it.
this is semantics, but the timeline thing doesn't work for these movies. there is no scenario where the first class world can become the x-men/origins world. emma frost is an adult (child in origins), xavier is paralyzed (but isn't paralyzed until later in the original world). hell, even between origins and the original film, cyclops is too young. if he was in origins (he was), he'd be over 50 by the time *x-men* rolls around (he wasn't). basically, every time there's a continuity error, it would be equivalent to a different dimension. just like in the marvel universe. earth-350, earth-351, and earth-352.
my roommate and i have started going through parks and rec again because he's never seen it. reddit has been full of references lately i find.
it's only manspreading if your just taking all the space on the fookin tube while obviously you could be letting people in
i live in a big city and use public transportation. speaking as a guy myself, the number of other guys who insist on spreading their legs so that they push your legs and take up space into the other seat is unbearable, esp in rush hour. i don't care how big your balls are, this is about common courtesy.
i watched some of the interview with jackman and patrick stewart. holy crap, how drunk was patrick? i'm guessing he'd had a couple before he went on because he was *so* touchy feely and random.
you'd think they'd have learned not to over serve guests after the whole mark wahlberg thing
they are four glasses in the top pic and two in the bottom pic. explanation: time travel
graham knows how to work a couch, that's for damn sure.
the prestige. batman and wolverine fight over who is better at magic.
and jean-luc picard is british right? (for what it's worth, the only possible explanation i can come up for picard and his entire family being some sort of landed british gentry (in the finest queen's english: "tea, earl grey. hot.") in the middle of france is that britain finally conquers france sometime between now and the arrival of the vulcans in 2063. mark twain was right - we only saw the good bits. where are all the french serfs in the vineyards? what is the federation hiding?!)
yes but it is wolverine the canadian character who has the mutant healing factor and not the australian actor hugh jackman.
the character in origins was a completely different character who shared the diamond ish power of frost. notice she wasn't even telepathic. xavier has a drug that let's him walk, as well as just projecting himself as walking with his mind, so he very well could have been paralyzed before origins. and scott's age is exactly right. 14 in 1979, which is when origins takes place, 17 in 1982 when apocalypse takes place, early 30s in the original xmen movies. so none of those really conflict.
reddit is always going to be full of references to major network television. don't let the circlejerk baader-meinhoff you. which is its own circlejerk. see:futurama, it's always sunny, the office, family guy, game of thrones, breaking bad, seinfeld, the office, south park, all of the netflix originals basically, friends, doctor who, etc. any given day for the past 4 years i've see at least a quarter of this list mentioned on reddit.
i used to really dislike this channel but the guy is weirdly growing on me.
my lord if talk shows were like that in america it would be soooo much better. everything feels so stiff and scripted. graham norton is a god damn national treasure.
this is one of my favorite comments on reddit. probably because i study harry potter in hopes of becoming a wizard, but it's so under appreciated as a comment.
to me that movies plot was a bit of stupid in the end. **spoiler** --- i mean, the guy could've solved world hunger by making an endless supply of livestock or conquer the earth by creating a clone army of himself, but instead he used it for a magic trick.
it's crazy how much i like that episode considering how much i loathe singing in live action movies and the like.
it's a thin line between chicken taco shells and kfc double down
so a few things: origins takes place in the 70s. cyclops is a teenager there. x-men takes place in 2000. putting cyclops at about 40. the guy in the movie is not that old. also, the girl in the movie is credited as emma. and she just happens to have emma frost's powers? come on, guy. there's a ***really*** simple explanation here. the x-men movies have no real continuity overall. they were largely made as a cash grab by people who didn't care about the source material. that's why they had the audacity to turn deadpool into a teleporting wolverine with laser beam eyes.
i can see why you'd dislike him as he tends to get shoved down peoples throats. kinda reminds me of jon stewart with the daily show. a lot of things he says are valid but then mindlessly regurgitated across the internet and memed to holy hell. but he does make a lot of good points. he's slightly hypocritical but hey so was jon stewart.
i really hope you don't think nicolas flamel was just a harry potter character....
its a thing? i was just there the other day and saw no such item.
to be fair, prior to the mcu there was no precedent for that kind of thing, where multiple franchises are combined and continuity is prioritized. even then, that's something that has become a valid criticism of the mcu (and the dc equivalent which seems to just be trying to mimic it), which is that the movies are too preoccupied with continuity or setting up other films such that the individual films suffer.
that's a good point. people going crazy over every video he posts did get annoying. i originally disliked that he just did reactions to already funny videos, and he gets praise for being original or funny himself. i like his original videos hes done a lot more (vape nation was good)
he was a fucking asshole of a drunk, as well. not charming or funny, but still wanted to be centre of attention. which is usually indicative of someone who's an asshole in general.
would it really be that big of a deal if they did?
oh yeah definitely a thing. it's called the naked chicken chalupa and they even have a box meal for it.
wolverine is australian is what he's trying to say
there's been so much talk of corporate manipulation on reddit lately that any positive conversation about products puts me on edge.
i mean, yeah (this would be my top post and get gilded)
alright enough, that's way too adorable and genuine. i wish i will be able to do that exact thing someday
everyone in this thread thinks the teddy bear will be put out to pasture but little do you know that it will be given to the puppy who will love it until it rips its stuffing out
that stuffed dog is going to be the saddest toy story 4 character i've ever seen.
they will be best friends until one day she will cry again. source: have ~~owned~~ loved dogs
protip: if you're a kid and want your parents to let you have a dog, tie a string to the lid of your laundry hamper. name it. pet it. lead it around. teach it to heel. eventually they will realize a dog is cheaper than therapy and give in. (worked on my folks!)
i'm 30 years old. i'm still quite confident that stuffed animals have feelings.
watching this with my dying dog next to me legitimately made me cry for the first time in years.
thanks. now i'm fucking bawling my eyes out. pets are the best. every kid should grow up with at least one.
step 1, hide the teddy bear before puppy finds it.
this is awesome! but if anyone wants to get a pet make sure you really want them. they are not simple gifts! they are a commitment! spread the love of puppers this christmas, or doggos too!
...and teddy was put in the attic, never to be hugged again.
i think my favorite part was how thankful and loving she seemed even with just the toy dog
almost 15 years ago, we did this for my sons 3rd birthday with a kitten. last night, hank the cat died of old age in my sons arms. it was sad, but hank had a great life. we will miss him terribly.
and retired to sunnyside daycare with his pal lotso.
i love how the entire time they're having that deep moment of comfort the pug is just being a pug
pugs are the happiest, derpiest little floof balls.
losing my beagle = worst day of my life. i know this means i have a pretty charmed life, but fuck, it sucked
and all the love that will happen in between will make the crying worthwhile.
i still cry sometime when i think of my dog that died 7 years ago. :(
my older brother once recently said that when you get a puppy you are also getting a tragedy.
part of the reason my fiancee and i are currently waiting is we'll be leaving to travel to our parents houses for the holiday season, and i feel like getting a dog and the confusing the fuck out of it about where it's home was wouldn't be nice. most of the reason we've been holding off on it for the past month or so
be ready to put the work in if you're getting a puppy!
my husband gave in and agreed to get a dog. our boys had been asking for a while, too. he admitted after just a few weeks of having the new pup how much he underestimated the positive impact it would have on the family dynamic as a whole.
when i was little, i would rotate which stuffed animals slept on the bed with me so none of them felt left out.
so am i. and i am in my 40's. i still make sure all the stuffed animals have a blanket when it is cold. *(i may or may not have mental health issues)*
yes the girl obviously asked for a real dog but was happy with the stuffed animal anyway. and then she gets the real dog and is happy beyond hope. you hope for this kind of thankfulness from your children.
i would add, before you get your kids a dog, make sure they are not allergic. got my daughter a puppy last year. then she started having constant runny nose and sneezing. turns out she's allergic to dogs. we refuse to give up the dog so we have to manage the allergies instead.
i realized in this however long clip that my life is shit. i have never been this happy about anything to this second in my life.
i was actually thinking she looked kind of sad and disappointed. i'm guessing she asked for a dog, and thought she just got a toy dog.
read this as sunnyvale and was trying to figure out which tpb was nicknamed lotso
yeah i'm gonna need a feature length film about this asap.
can't you see? they got a new pet! no more grandpa.
pug is a pug's default setting. unless it wants to chase something. which case its a pugrocket setting.
they're lucky the pug didn't hop out of the box and go running out the door.
even better. she's so sweet and grateful and overwhelmed. you can tell she's wanted one for a very long time. this video almost made me want a daughter and a dog. ugh.
the puppy kind of have this "okay, wtf is up with this human? can i wander around? no? alright, thisismylifenow..." totally adorable!!
the day my beagle died was the day i learned it is possible to cry so much you end up sick for a week. it's crazy how much a dog can steal your heart
i've lost two..well three if you include the family dog when i was a kid, he was just a little dog but he chipped my tooth somehow when playing, it was my first new tooth...it's still chipped today. obviously can never forget that dog but i can't say he was mine, ....or maybe i can. my dogs were big dogs, shepard mastif cross and a shepard akita cross, he and she are a part of me...forever. on a lighter note, i once had a rottweiler clamp down hard on my leg because i made a threatening move on his master (my buddy) we were drunk and messing around..... i looked down at the dog, his teeth had pierced my jeans, my sock andw my skin and he looked back up at me... we had a moment of communication with our eyes, he said "if you close your mouth, i'll open mine." i immediately agreed.
i cry when i think about my dog from 30 years ago.
my father died when i was ten, everybody and everything dies. one of the few good things about dogs living shorter lives than us is they usually never know the sorrow of our deaths. they live thier lives within our lives, the love they bring never leaves us and the sorrow of thier deaths is only our burden, not thiers.
your gif has replaced my tears of joy with pure maniacal laughter
oh shit that is perfect, really looks like bewilderment at getting the stuffed animal, and then silent acceptance!
i'll tell my partner you said so. he wouldn't talk back to the waitress.
we need a hypoallergenic dog so a puppy is unlikely--we'll need to take an older dog from a rescue if we can get a rescue of that breed at all.
i have found myself arranging mine so that the predators and the prey are not together when unsupervised (i'm also in my 40s). mental health issues be damned, who knows what those things will get up to when i'm not looking.
i almost wish i didn't already have two dogs, so that i could get my kids a puppy when they inevitably ask for one.
yep, like she was disappointed but trying not to be shitty about it.
my son has a lotso that he refuses to go to sleep without. my wife and i just tell ourselves that he is the nice, pre-abandonment lotso. it makes it easier to not hate him.
the most compelling reason to invent mind reading is to know what the fuck goes trough an animals head when they see a shitty human disguise like this.
ugh i want to get one so badly, but i would feel like a monster because of their health problems and me helping cause more breeding and shit.
he obviously knows hisn girlfriend better than we do. also chances are if the dog had a heart tumor and had to be put down it wasn't an instant thing, she probably had some time to grieve while it was still alive.
why not? theres lots of dogs that need a good home fuck it, just get another one
agreed. it might not have been the exact same day though, he might've just said 'today.' he did say she'd been crying for a long time. might just be wishful thinking on my part. that pug though :3 even if she was a little upset, hard to stay that way after seeing it!!
get the daughter first because if you get the dog first you won't be able to make a video like this one.
i love children who say thank you. i love this child.
it feels like yesterday i picked up my now 6 year old gsd. i am not looking forward to the inevitable.
my two family cats were 11 years old when my mom died. people say cats don't care about people, but that's not true. they were walking around, meowing, for days on end after she passed away, looking for her. even though the two didn't get along very well, they'd both sit on her side of the bed, waiting for her to come lay down and pet them, but she never came back.
wait till jan/feb though, a lot of people buy puppies over the christmas holidays and then dump them when they realize puppies are work.
we find ourselves going out to the park as a family more to watch the dog enjoy himself. we bond over laughing at his antics. we commiserate when he sits on one of us (he's 85 pounds). he is simply pure entertainment and we are making the same memories together. dogs give unconditional love and help the kids feel better when they've had a rough day.
people always have issues with people. this is exaggerated in families. this is even more exaggerated in families with young kids. however, everyone loves the dog. it's a common bond you all have.
joke's on you, antidepressants cancel out the effects.
just erupted a mouthful of water all over my bed at this comment. well done good sir or madam.
whatever you do don't be dozy fucking moron parents who let their kid bring their toys to an unfamiliar place and don't immediately ask where they left them as soon as you see it's out of their hands. also, too lazy to drive back to the picnic spot once they realized they'd left them behind.
that's ok though, it loops after that so you'll get the plushie corgie again... right?
bob, the human is back. no no, don't look. yes bob, i know it's racist, but what can you do? they don't know any better.
just don't do it on the holidays. so many pets get returned because of irrational decisions. if you want to get a pet for christmas for someone else, please get a gift certificate instead. pick out a pet that you both can agree on and feel is suitable.
some people need time to mourn, and a new dog is really painful to them. some people want to pour their love into a new life right away. crazily enough, both types of people can exist without either being wrong!
"sorry, honey, but we *told* you not to open your eyes. it's christmas, so we'll be nice and let you say goodbye, but we're going to have to put her down now and it's your fault."
i don't know how popular this opinion is but it's exactly that that makes life beautiful. when you figure in the uncertainty of the entire universe what do you figure the chances are that you'd meet your lovely doggo? probably not very good. but you did meet and it's just that bit of the unknown that makes things like meeting friends, puppers, doggos, that nice homeless dude down the street all the more beautiful. it didn't have to happen, it wasn't even likely, but it did. go rub that doggo's belly bro.
cats care. my daughters cat will come and sit on her lap if she is crying and rub her tears away with his checks, both claiming her as his human and purring intensively at the same time. when she goes on school camps or visits relatives he pines and sulks until she comes back. when she is sick with the flu he will not leave her side. i love cats
no, don't wait. shelters are near capacity year round and there are dogs who need loving homes now. it's never a bad time to look to adopt!
i played nintendogs when i was younger, it was really cool and can attest to dogs being really cool
i was never a dog person until i made the ultimate sacrifice and got my husband a dog. now i get jealous when the dog cuddles him instead of me.
and the dog loves everyone, don't forget that part. a dog can bring clear, unconditional love to people who might not have it already. dog dgaf who lied or cheated or said mean things. dog just wants to chill with his humans.
and if someone doesn't love the dog, you know not to trust them.
most people definitely love dogs, but there are also many who also don't. for example, when i was a kid, my mom hated dogs, but she eventually gave in and got one for us. and it made life hell. my dad only wanted a big dog, and my mom just hated that he would jump on her and lick her and she wanted nothing to do with him. and as a result, she became more grouchy all the time and would always yell and scream because she honestly hated life with a dog. so while i'm not saying that having a dog isn't great (it was nice having our dog around before my mom gave him away), sometimes it just doesn't work out for certain families, and it's false to say that it always has a positive impact.
hold my leash, i'm going in! (am i redditing right?)
that's why i stopped taking mine. sure, i tried to kill myself a couple weeks later but then i smoked some heroin and i was fine. wubalubadubdub!
no bob, wait! bob, stop trying to fuck the human! damn it, bob!
* sold to a korean restaurant. welcome to the real world with consequences kiddo.
my little sister is special needs and once in a while has these screaming fits, my mom got a kitten for her to see if it would help. turns out whenever my sister has one of her fits the cat rushes right to her and snuggles with her because my little sister does feel better when she can pet her kitty. i swear that cat knows exactly what's going on cause there's never any hesitation from her.
only tangential related story: wife and i both came into the relationship with dogs (that we coincidentally got near the beginning of the relationship). my my dog *hated* her at first. he would tear her stuff when she spent the night, try to push her off the bed, the works. now the traitorous bastard cuddles her more than me.
my dog loves my boyfriend and his mom.... i'm the one who feeds, treats, bathes, and walks the little mutt... but the moment she sees my boyfriend all bets are off. i'm a jealous owner.
we have had fights between our kids stop immediately when we point out their angry voices are scaring the dog. it is amazing how they stop and then both go and make sure the dog is okay. they dog responds to moods so clearly and without hidden motive it makes everyone better people.
not trying to sound like an asshole but you especially have to train bigger dogs not to jump on people when you get them
so your poorly trained dog did poorly trained dog things?
no because he didn't link it... lazy assholes, all of you.
wow. never thought i'd see the proper use of "wubalubdubdub". that being said, you doing okay over there?
wait this is from an actual trial? the timing and everything is so hilarious i always figured it was scripted.
eventually got my shit under control and went back on the ads. still want to die but i'm less likely to do anything about it.
mental health needs to be taken as seriously as physical health; until that point, there will be issues like this.
how does suicide rates compare between veterans and non veterans in terms of percentages? not saying this isn't a problem, but knowing that information would really put this into perspective and eliminate ambiguity in the data. i work for walmart, america's largest employer. if a lot of people who work at walmart end up killing themselves does that mean walmart is evil? not necessarily, you'd need to compare that % to the % of people who kill themselves out of the entire population. walmart employees has a really big population of people, some are bound to commit suicide, if the suicide rates are the same as the general population we will know walmart is not the issue.
to be honest it's pretty impressive how low casualties have been considering both of those wars have lasted for so long. i'm pretty sure there were single days in ww1 and ww2 where more people died than in well over 8 years of combat in iraq and afghanistan.
as someone who knows several folks who are part of that statistic (and have come perilously close to joining it myself), i really wish this knowledge was more widespread. veteran healthcare through the va is a complete fucking joke, and most vets can't afford civilian healthcare which leaves many of these former warriors feeling like they only have one option to kill the pain.
just as a general rule of thumb graffiti isn't the best place to get your facts.
my dad, who was a colonel, killed himself in 2014. west point graduate, served 30 years in the army. was deployed to iraq in 2006 and was injured pretty bad. pretty much broke his back. was the brigade commander for ft drum and ft dix before he retired in 2011. he was a soldier through and through and not doing soldier things + ptsd + survivors guilt + wrong medication = gunshot to the head. the va is the fucking scourge.
for the population in the military, how many would be expected to commit suicide if the wasn't a war? i don't mean to diminish the risk of suicide, but want to better understand the impact of war.
it also shouldn't be ignored that the death toll from the iraq war at the end of america's occupation was over 4,000 american soldiers and over 70,000 iraqis based on conservative estimates. that's what we spent our tax dollars on from 2003 to 2014.
the problem with a lot of the combat arms in the military is that if you show any sign of mental weakness, you get kicked to the side and treated like shit. i was in the infantry for 4 years and had 3 guys kill themselves for this reason. one of my them had crippling ptsd but wanted stripes so he stuck it out.
is it just me or is that some bad fucking photoshop?
how bout we give our honored veterans the same good health care all those politicians get *for life* sittin' on their ass in washington?
no one cares. i mean that, literally. when you're kids, no one cares about depression and suicide because the ones who usually are affected by it are considered the "lowlifes" of society and no one wants to confront it. "oh? he/she committed suicide? must be a loser." and then, when we're adults, we go to work every day, say good morning, make small talk, and yet we have no idea of the mental state of the people we work with because no one wants to really get to know someone else. "oh? he/she committed suicide? i had no idea. he/she always seemed so happy." ofcourse they **seem** happy, it's the mask they wear so that we can even be considered for work.
meanwhile the number of iraqi civilians that died was 10x that.
pro tip: dont join the military if you dont want to kill people or possibly be killed. dont join if you dont want memories of killing people or possibly being killed. its so simple even an american could do it! stop joining fake war efforts,you idiots. no country is attacking america, no country is trying to take your freedoms (except america) so stop joining the military to fight against people who are not attacking you.
yep... have a 2 tour army friend who is ptsd'd to the point of barely being able to make it through his day. his stories about trying to get help from the va are heartbreaking. "the first thing they ask when you have a va visit for ptsd is if you feel like hurting yourself or others... they should really ask that before you leave."
i'm going to be dense here -- are we not taking this issue seriously? are we ignoring veteran and enlisted suicides? and what's a benchmark for success? equal to civilian rate? is that realistic considering the type of work? i feel like this is just another bullshit "awareness" post that doesn't really address any of the details that require thought and work.
medicinal marijuana is great for ptsd, meanwhile the people who claim to support our troops want to crack down on it.
people often think doctors have a cushy job because they get paid well but most of them work their asses off, especially when they are still in school or in residency. residents commonly work like 24-30 hour shifts, sometimes even longer ones. and then they stay to finish documentation. theyre actually at work like 100+ hours a week. even if you love your job, thats way too much time. add to that the pressure of the job and the stress is ridiculous
when i was in middle school, i had a psychiatrist who was helping me with some ptsd and other things. i got ready for my appointment one day but learned that i wouldn't be going because he had killed himself. before he did it, he had written prescriptions for all of his patients for whatever meds they needed. he was a nice guy.
as someone who have an md and possibly killing myself soon i fully agree on this article ............good bye
at least they didn't use vietnam for their statistics
the nationwide suicide rate is 14 in 100,000. for veterans it's 30 in 100,000, which is lower than the suicide rate for engineers which is 32 in 100,000. for people who work in farming, fishing and forestry it's 84.5 in 100,000. according to the cdc
major advances in field level trauma medicine. ww2/vietnam maybe one guy could make a tourniquet out of something? now literally everyone in a platoon is trained on controlling bleeding, and fixing tension pneumothorax (2 top killers in combat). combine that with armor advances, and some of the other technology (not having to send guys into meat grinders like normandy, for one) you get what you have now. not sure how to quantify it, but the ratio of killed to wounded must be drastically changed with our modern conflicts as well.
this number is actually not that high as 500000, but the fact remains that most of the casualties are civilians in an unnecessary war. this should not be ignored, also not in this thread
what do you get from working in that environment? sounds like hell to me.
very true. i was seeking mental health while active duty service and was discharged honorably with a re4( i will never be able to re enlist) and the type was 'personality disorder' so it makes it very hard to get approved for disability. i'm still applying however.
are you being told that by the rumor mill or have you seen that happen? either way it's shitty, but i know for a fact people can be suicide attempt survivors or on antidepressants and still hold a ts/sci job. the real problem isn't getting treatment, it's what happens when you don't
army guy here. i don't know about the other branches, but where i'm at i can go talk to my platoon sergeant at any time to make an appointment with behavioral health if i feel i need to. one of my buddies has regular appointments there for depression.
i am in the army, but i don't see why this needs to be about the military. mental health is a serious problem across the entire population and is underfunded in canada.
for a long time, the suicide rate was about the same or lower in the military as it was in a similar population of nonmilitary. a few years ago it got over, but i think it fell back below.
/u/skypork, what aspect of it isn't? as a veteran, i have 1on1 counseling, group therapy, even a psychiatrist w depression prescription available to me for free (have utilized each in the past, no need these days). hell, they even let my ex and i attend couples counseling sessions at no cost, and our issues weren't even particularly related to my service (we got together *after* i got out of the military, and she was going through her own stuff at the time).
it's a dumb question any time. i am ex army, i hurt myself regularly. i know it isn't a good thing. i wish i could magic it away, but i can't. so i muddle through the same way thousands of other vets do. the question, though, is as silly as it has always been. if i don't want to be held against my will at some facility, my answer to that question is no, regardless of what the actual answer to that question is.
my nephew is in 2nd year vet school. he told me a few already dropped out. why is the suicide rate so high?
that makes sense. i assume the pain and fear is what holds a lot of people back - if a painless method was accessible it would change everything for anyone battling.
i'm guessing this varies a lot by each specific medical field, right? my friend's dad is a dermatologist, and he makes it sound way less stressful than other md careers. i've also heard that dermatology is one of the most competitive medical fields to get into, i'd imagine for that reason
someone please correct me if i'm wrong, but my understanding is that a law was passed relativelt recently preventing residents from working more than 80 hours/week. which is still a lot, don't get me wrong, but significantly better than the 100+ hours it often was before that rule.
don't. find a new career. take a long vacation. you're one of the good ones, we need you
what's up with fishing, farming and forestry? why so high?
this is incredibly interesting. i always take my time when meeting a freshly transitioning vet. it was the hardest thing for me, and really just talking helps. it's almost so hard to explain, but when i first got back, i knew i was different. i knew that i had different mindset, and i often found myself isolated and unable to talk or relate to people except other vets. i'm not sure about the other branches, but specifically with the marine corps, you really don't fully embody the idea that you were living in a completely isolated society, entirely segregated from mainstream society until almost 5 years getting out. it's would be similar to trying to retrain a dog to a new environment.
men are much more likely to kill themselves than women, nearly 4 times as many per 100,000, and make up the vast majority of veterans. it isn't fair to directly compare veterans to the general population when it comes to suicide.
i can clarify some of what i saw while in. the military still follows hippa to the letter, but commanders can ask for a note from said counselor or psychiatrist. if someone is facing ucmj (uniform code of military justice, usually when you do something bad) then a letter is sent to command. the letter states what the person's condition is and what the recommendation of their doctor is. now, no commander can pull an actual medical record or make a soldier pull it for them. they can however ask things like, has my soldier had his immunizations, is my soldier dying, is my soldier crazy, and even those cases are very very very rare. the military is still a federal job and follows federal rules, so medical records are off limits unless the soldier is a risk. i should say that some people can and will do shady stuff, but that's everywhere.
if money is an issue, go to the dav (disabled american veterans)join for 20 bucks or so and they will fight for your disability. they are an awesome resource.
have you contacted a lawyer? until you do so, your application for it virtually goes from the fax machine to the shredder.
it's such a long and tedious process to get $800 a month or whatever and that won't cover anything. if i could have a place to relax for 6 months to 2 years or whatever the process took, then i could probably work on therapy and shit but instead i've found my own way working from home and fuck 'em. i hope you get your shit sorted out with them but it isn't something to bank on unless you have a lot of time on your hands. work with a lawyer if possible.
there's more than that. culture, commander, etc also often play a role. small/specialized units tend to perform better but it's a taboo across the board.
generally, yeah- it's a nightmare to explain for a sc and basically impossible to get tsc with a history of mental health issues. i'm extremely thankful i haven't had to deal with much during my time but i have seen some very talented folks get the boot for getting help.
yeah, i mean, there are resources out there for us. our healthcare covers it. we still have a problem across the forces though, due to the nature of the line of work. some of it is combat related, some of it is toxic leadership in some units. i mean, the lack of control in life on top of all that pressure to perform from above can do a number on people just in garrison. then as far as vets go, i'm pretty sure (in theory) the va will comp vets with mental health issues like ptsd, depression, whatever, but i think the issues have to be claimed prior to ets,just like with knee injuries, back problems, and so on. so if you decide to get out, make sure your shit is all accounted for before you get your dd214 to be safe.
i'm not the user you responded to, but in my experience, cost/funding is the biggest barrier to accessing mental healthcare. i 100% agree with you that mental health for all populations needs better consideration both in terms of funding and social attitudes. however, it makes sense to me that the treatment of trauma experienced as a result of military service should be funded as part of the military budget. it would not make sense to have the military budget cover outpatient therapy for people unaffiliated with the armed forces.
it has to do with the military for incredibly obvious reasons: members of the american military experience mental health issues like ptsd at many, many, many times the rate of the rest of the population. i don't disagree with you that population-wide mental health support would be good. but...you know...the context of this conversation is the picture above. members of our military are committing suicide faster than our enemies can even kill them. it's pretty shocking.
it is everything to do with the military. mental health is an issue affecting all americans, but in terms of being held responsible for servicemen, the government really should pay. think of it like workmans comp for a an injury resulting from the job.
i did some math to back up what you're saying: 2009 u.s. population: 306,800,000 (u.s. census bureau) suicide rate: **0.00119%** *excluding military personnel* (isu.edu) 2009 active duty personnel: 1,418,542 (dod) suicide rate: **0.00214%** so yes, suicide rates are higher than average in the military vs. the general population in 2009. however, it is important to note that 2009 was the highest year on record. if you look at 2008: **0.00091%** , which is lower than the national average. in fact, dentists were nearly twice as likely to commit suicide than military personnel that year.
i agree. i have acceptable mental care from the va. i have my choice of psychologist and have a psychiatrist with medications all for free. even when i was in the service the same was available to me. there was a stigma attatched to it. i didn't care because i wanted to get better. i think the resources are there but there is a mindset problem that keeps it from getting used. i don't think this is a lack of funding issue. this is an attitude problem. the military needs to normalize the mental health aspects. you aren't weak because you are going to mental health, you are in an unforgiving job out under crazy amounts of stress in dangerous situations. you probably can't deal with that on your own without giving something else up like your health (through drinking) or your relationships.
right. isn't that a phrase that carries legal weight behind it these days... if you walk into an emergency room and say "i am a danger to myself and others" aren't they legally obligated to put you on a psyche hold? nearly done it a few times myself during my own non-military related mental health issues... but then you think about what's going to happen if you do and it's like... i'd rather take the chance i can ride this out. wish i had something to offer you and everyone else other than my good wishes.
i get your gist. but i'm not sure if its a dumb question. i think what you mean is that the current consequences to that question are dumb. of which i wholeheartedly agree. in the big picture, that question has to get asked and answered - both sincerely - if we plan to make a dent into this problem. but there has to be legitimate and manageable services attached to the answer whichever it may be. currently and unfortunately that's not the case.
what if the answer is yes? because the treatment is pretty different for actively homicidal/suicidal patients than it is for patients with passive ideation if i had to guess, i'd say 98% of psychiatric inpatient admissions are voluntary. you have almost zero chance of ever being held "against your will" unless you're convicted of a major felony or under the age of 18.
i took my sick cat in to put him down a few months ago. they wanted $250 for it. felt like they were taking advantage of me.
now's as good a time as any to give a shout out to pet health insurance. if you can afford it (and owning a pet's an expensive business, so hopefully you can) a small monthly cost can save you countless thousands of dollars in medical bills down the road. my cat's been sick several times. i'm not sure what i would have done without it.
i've known someone to say they would put their dog down for any medical expense over $500, because at that price they could buy a new dog. i was floored at how cold hearted someone could be towards their own pet.
as i look at my 5 month old kitten who was so happy when we got her home... my heart breaks into two. how can someone be so awful? don't get a pet if it's just an accessory to you!
it's a depressing job. you have to euthanize allot of animals.
yeah, having a car and a garage was not helpful for me, and it's largely the same thing (talking about carbon monoxide). there were multiple times when i had the key in the ignition, but held back for some stupid, petty reason.
i wish if i can do that but unfortunately i invest so much in medicine i don't want to waste all my father money but what's the point if i am a failure why even try ? i just did one of my 3 exams and i am going to get the result in a week i am not sure what i am going to do if i failed it or got a low score it's soooo comparative here i am will not have chance 4 years of depression and 7 years in medicine and then all that for nothing ...... i am done
good point, although the stress of jobs like an engineer or soldier is almost certainly a factor as well.
woah now wtf is this about the suicide rate for engineers? i'm an ee major. shit.
yes the suicide rate for men is 20 out of 100,000.. so the military being primarily male, 30 out of 100,000 seems perfectly normal.
a combination of low income, work-home imbalance, socioeconomic inequalities, general isolation and unwillingness to seek out mental health services
men are more likely to successfully commit suicide, while women are more likely to attempt suicide
this is really helpful information. thank you for sharing this to help me better understand how the process works. i fear the articles i read gave me an inaccurate impression and i appreciate you bringing that to light for me.
no i have not. i'm actually watching my brothers house and the dogs while he's out of the us. but when i get home i'm gonna contact them. there's a company that will help i think it's vso or something that i had applied through so it wasn't independent. i have faith in them. but regardless, i will still explore my options and lawyer up. thank you.
well i am currently unemployed. that income would make such a difference to me. i'm living in a veterans homeless shelter. and i have my release date in a couple months. i'm stressing pretty hard. but with that income i could qualify for hudvash housing in sect. 8 and they only require 30% of income for rent. at least that's enable me to get back to a stable ground and bounce back to being a contributing citizen of society. and who knows, maybe that'd help my depression and mental health issues.
no, seriously, it's not. i've used mflc; there is no way for anyone to "log" anything because there's absolutely nothing to log. you never give your name, they never take notes, there is no paper trail for anything. i get how difficult it is to seek help when you need it, but at some point, you're making bullshit excuses to rationalize refusing to go. don't go and that's fine, but don't spread fucking nonsense to scare off other people who could seriously benefit from the help.
it also skews the numbers a bit that the pool of soldiers who committed suicide is much larger than the pool who served in iraq.
i wish more people knew that getting help for a problem and confronting your fears is a sign of *strength*, not weakness. standing face-to-face with the demons of your own mind is terrifying.
that's pretty silly, army is not a place to show masculinity. it's about performance and result. soldiers need to be in top shape for war, fake pretending masculinity won't help.
in combat units, especially infantry where i am, there is a giant stigma that anyone who gets mental health treatment is a pussy or can't ever be in your platoon again for fear of them breaking down. another thing is fix the goddamn va. one thing they can do is not deny soldiers the mental healthcare they need when seeking it.
there's much bigger issues than costs for the patient, ptsd is a nebulous and poorly understood affliction just like most mental disorders. it requires deeper research and exploration of all methods of treatment. today the treatment for ptsd that most doctors will give is some counseling and lots of drugs, none of which are universally effective. maps is doing an interesting study using mdma to treat ptsd which has had a lot of success.
if congress wants to add another $84bn to the defense budget, maybe they can do something to help keep our soldiers safe once they come home.
it's less shocking when you take into account former soldiers from both ww2, korean, and vietnam. we have a lot of former soldiers and though their suicides rates are higher then average, there are other risk factors that make other populations more prone to suicide. this picture makes you think that it's only suicide from soldiers that have gone to iraq and afghanistan, but those suicides include the older generations that have served as well as this new generation.
my wife thinks it's amazing! unlike psychotherapy the research is also heavily quantatative (rather than qualitative as is the case with traditional treatments) so it's easier to fund - you can say "well research has shown a 90% recovery rate for ptsd with 10 sessions therefore we can fund 10 sessions". it also has less stigma, it literally involves someone writing down their trauma as light is flashed into their eyes; sounds so weird but my wife swears by it...
yea, i pay out of pocket, b/c the vet i go to knows me and when the charge is really high or there is a sudden cost, they let me pay weekly or monthly until the charges are paid off. but that pet insurance is a great thing for most people, and i really should get it regardless. i'm just lazy, even though i know several people who said without it they would've lost their animal. sometimes they don't cover all of what they should, but when you really need it, the insurance can be a life saver and allow you to pay for procedures that could be a few thousand dollars or more!
get trupanion. 90% coverage indefinitely. go with high deductible to cover mega emergencies.
let me tell you... it'll get worse. my cats are 3 years old and i love the chompy little buggers more every single day. i give my wife crap because she used to say she thought kittens were cute but she didn't care for adult cats... now she loves the grown ups even more than when we had them as kittens. congrats on getting a new cat. one tip for you... get yourself a turbo scratcher. my cats favorite toy by far.
while it is sounds horrible, you should ask yourself how much the cat is worth. if issues develop, how much is too much? $100, $500, $2000, maybe $10,000. as sad as it is there comes a point when it's not worth the financial strain on your life. personally as long as it's a tough decision, it means you're a good person.
you just have to take it one day at a time man, one exam means nothing in the long run. even if you're talking about the step exams, you'll look back one day and laugh about them while you're making a comfortable living helping people. there's so much you can do with an md degree you're never stuck, and being a doctor alone is something you and your parents should be proud of. trust me, i'm not going for an md but another professional degree in healthcare and am in a shit ton of debt and things do sort of suck right now, but i have confidence it'll be better down the road. just stick it out dude, you were smart and accomplished enough to get into med school, so you've also got what it takes to make it through.
well i survived the marine corps, but am currently getting a degree in forestry and natural resources. should i be concerned? not that i'm gonna kill myself, i just want a good job.
more suicide attempts for women are *reported*. it is a crucial difference. men are far less likely to seek medical care or psychiatric care so i find it very likely their suicide attempts are underreported.
also the dod (assuming you're us military) has open a process to have your discharge reevaluated. i haven't seen what the process is exactly because it's just sites like navy times and such reporting on it, but it's worth looking into.
this was my first thought, was every suicide counted only if the soldier was on active duty? i want mental health to be taken seriously too, but pitting it against those kia is not the right way to do it..
it's not fake pretending masculinity though, sometimes trauma might affect one guy out of a group and he'd justifiably feel self-conscious about that. "why are they okay and not me?" another worry is that say you're going to be given some sort of career boost, be it ranger school or a promotion or what have you, they might feel that if they're seen as "mentally ill/unfit" they're going to be passed over or miss out on something.
when i transfered from basic to ait, a soldier had just killed herself. my first weekend pass was revoked so we could all attend suicide awareness training. after an entire day watching videos and reading pamphletes we were told "most people show zero warning signs" ... great. you couldnt have opened with that?
i must have a different experience over here in pog land. every unit i've been in has regarded bh as no different than any other kind of health issue, other than the fact they have to emphasize that. if you need medical attention, fucking get it. but yeah, i hear so much shit about the va i hope i never have to use it.
i agree that we need to explore new avenues of psychopharmacology, in addition to all the other areas for improvement that pertain to efficacy of symptom reduction. my master's thesis was on barriers to mental health care, and the literature i reviewed was pretty consistent that inability to afford treatment was the most common obstacle people encountered. no matter how effective an intervention is, it's useless for a client who cannot receive it. that's what i'm talking about when i say "cost/funding is the biggest barrier to **accessing** mental healthcare."
neuro-feedback therapy is an interesting and growing field in the treatment of ptsd.
absolutely correct. another big barrier to exploration of treatment is also the gov (dea scheduling, fda approval, etc). which also includes big pharma "lobbying" and the cronies involved.
still today's treatment is better than ww1 where many faced a firing squad for "cowardice"
not to downplay the problem, but if that's the case then this picture is super misleading.
i just have to point this out; whoosh. edm=electronic dance music on another note that's great that emdr shows positive results and i can only hope that all possible treatments are looked into as mental health is incredibly important.
i understand what you mean i just everytime i remember or see one of my friends d's already started thier residency i get killed inside of how much faliure i am ....it's so hurtful i hate that feeling so much i am so angry at myself i have no love for me .....this is why
then separate it by sex, like the statistics collected by the va. ###suicides per 100,000 ||civilian|veteran/active-service| :---|:---:|:---: **female**|5.2|28.7 **male**|20.9|32.1
failed suicide attempts are not your normal "seeking medical care" -- it's emergency care, and there are usually other people involved. men also use guns a lot more -- a botched suicide with a gun generally requires medical care. though women use pills a lot more, go to sleep, and wake up -- these may often go un-reported, since you may not seek medical care when you wake up.
will do. i didn't know that and never heard it for an honorable discharge. but il look into it. thank you.
yes. i had already asked my psychologist and psychiatrist to write a letter telling them they believe i was misdiagnosed. i have a substantial amount of records showing severe depression and ptsd as well as some other diagnoses. i'm hoping that makes the difference.
and no matter what anyone saids, they will be. no one can outright say that mental health is the reason someone is passed over but they'll find another reason outside the range of discrimination claims. they (people in power) always do.
agree 100%. both psilocybin and mdma have shown huge benefits for trauma recovery and counseling. they've been doing research on mdma in some other western nations for years now, and i've seen quotes from therapists who claim that one session where the patient takes a dose of mdma leads to breakthroughs and progress that usually take months or years to achieve. it really is a shame that the broken, corrupt, vile dea is such a massive barrier to science and healthcare in the us that they would rather blindly stick to their agenda than help veterans of war.
i can't upvote this enough. society seems to have such a disdain for the homeless but the majority suffer from mental illness or addiction.
exactly. no one is going to want you in their high speed unit if they find out you're "defective."
what i've never seen anyone address, is if we really want mental health to have the same "lack" of stigmas as any other health issue: is it an issue if they are passed over due to poor mental health? certainly people aren't given a pass for ranger school because they totally would have been able to make that run if they haven't had their ticket punched by the genetic lottery and ended up with a bone spur, or weak ankles or a hundred other diseases or physical ailments that affect performance. why shouldn't someone be passed over the same way for poor mental health wether it be genetic disease or a condition due to life events. yea, it's not your fault and there shouldn't be a stigma, but that in no way means it shouldn't affect your career opportunities in life or death fields that require peak physical and mental performance.
there are points being made in this thread that mental illness should be treated in some ways like physical illness. your statement is a good flip on that from the other direction, except for it to be valid you had to make the physical ailments in your statement connected to genetics, to imply that their is no way for those physical ailments to ever be conquered or dealt with completely without reoccurence. which is the same impression most people have of mental illness, that it's a deficiency never to be controlled or passed. obviously sometimes it is but more often if treated correctly it can be much like any other physical injury, patched up and moved on from. more so the injuries are often developed in the field, or through duty. mental and physical. it's inspiring to see a soldier's peers rally to rescue and rehabilitate him from a physical injury sustained in service, it should be the same with a mental injury.
10,000....font got smaller...... my prediction will be....... 100,000...font will get smaller
the video was uploaded in 2009, so it will hit 99,999 in 4 years
this was posted 7 years ago (almost 8). i wonder if he's still going?
he should have cut the video short right before it hit 10000.
he's gonna let it go for the rest of his life and at every major event it's gonna just go to the next number like it's meant to and for the rest of his life he'll be the "oh, alright..." guy or we can just start calling him mr. anti-climactic now.
i had a friend that lived in a house with room mates and refused to let the downstairs toilet be flushed because he wanted to see if it would fill up if no one flushed it. i tried to explain to him why that wouldn't work but he just stared at me blankly.
it's value is probably stored in an nstimeinterval which is just a double that represents number of seconds with the decimals being miliseconds. you'd have to wait about 10,000 years for anything interesting to happen. after a couple more decimal places the label might truncate the text displayed. so like it might become "100000:00:00...". or if the font scaling is set low enough then the text would just keep getting smaller.
to think he just kept his ipod charged straight for more than a year.
no dickbutt. no send nudes. no spanish inquisition. no rickroll. my world is crumbling down around me. what's happening?
remindme! 11 years "what the fuck happened to the planet? oh, and also some video or something?"
he had an emotional breakdown immediately afterwards.
4,160 days later: "alright, it's been 11 years, and the result...100,000...fuck me..." cue silence followed by a gunshot
surely someone started this with the original iphone when it first came out? in which case our wait is almost up!
damn, that dog has a good chance of being dead now :/
yeah but at least we didn't wast 416 days thinking about it.
why does everyone assume that he didn't do this in the video?
well if it used primarily for shitting, it would fill up
if i remember correctly that's when the reddit vs. digg fights were going on and some people got oddly tribalistic about it to the point where they would wear the clothing.
yeah, the issue was never really going to be about how the time was stored, specially since a number like 99999 is not a special number in binary form, so there was no reason to expect any special behavior. the thing i was curious about is how the timer would be represented on the screen, since this is such an extreme situation that it wouldn't be surprising if the apple engineers just didn't think that it was worth the trouble to handle it. although a font-scaling system is a pretty simple solution that they almost certainly already had written (i think the calculator does something similar) and just needed to implement.
phone does not have to be powered for timer to continue
what electricity bill? i doubt he sat there and watched the timer the entire time, even if he did, the costs are insignificant. running in the background, this uses magnitudes of less electricity than watching it. so insignificant that a single solitary ant probably uses more equivalent electricity, e.g. energy, over its short little life than this counter takes to keep track of time passing, even if he did it for years and years. and i'm not talking about a giant red ant here. i'm talking about the worlds record smallest ant ever, here. ;) do you really worry about how much electricity your timex watch costs you on your bill? that is just as silly. people concern themselves over the strangest things.
don't most people have their phone on 100% of the time anyway?
he probably doubted everything he was sure about before.
good news is he has a 10,000 hour head start. only 89,999 hours left. 3,749 days later....
depending on how many bits the integer is, the number will most likely go to 2 to the power of n then reset back to 0.
side note, the video stabilization on the 6p sure is shit. came from ios and didn't realize how good i had it. video is hardly usable now for me
are you saying australian's are a bunch of lying criminals?
digg was obviously the winner of that battle in the long-run.
font scaling is built into uilabel. there's a property for minimum font size you set. the text will shrink as it needs space.
he could have just done what you did, then lied about the video.
so current timestamp + 99983 hours ~ roughly max signed 32 bit int? why use signed?
"this is my first time taking this math class" -fifth time-
more like 10 dollars a year. that's kinda on the high side even.
everyone calling this thing a phone like they never heard of an ipod
no it's just calculates the time from the start time when you open the timer. so you just have to wait until the elusive day and power it on.
til: triumphant does **not** originate from describing emperor trump's actions!
emperor trump only requires these emergency powers in order to restore peace and order to the galaxy! once the construction of the ~~death~~ ~~peace~~ trump star has been completed, the state governors will have direct control over their jurisdiction, just as the founding fathers intended.
i read this as "emperor trump is in his third form" and i found that interpretation to be much more amusing.
it could theoretically be a 32 bit clock, with a precision of up to 0.1 seconds you could measure up to 13.6 years before your counter resets.
not sure if you're aware, but it only stabilizes 1080p and below. if you've got it set to 4k recording, you won't see anything, but the 1080p is pretty decent.
99,999 hours is over 11 years (his next milestone). 999,999 hours is over 114 years (the milestone after that). i doubt he's gonna live another 114 years.
pfft yeh right like anyone would lie on the internet.
til: there used to be videos of normal people internet. all we have now are 'uge buildings, 'uge boobies and 'uge stars.
i don't remember what we put that 'i' in for. was it trump i, and then through some comical typographical errors the 'i' was inserted in the middle, and then his beneficent holiness allowed the error to stand, creating a new word for greatness.
the trump star, it would be a giant t floating in space. every so often it engulfs itself in flames and parks itself down on some "urban folks" lawn
now im thinking of trump as a villain in dragonball z, which makes me laugh.
no, he is voted in every time. everyone there votes for him. everyone loves him. /s
you'll find out if they're using 16 bit integers soon.
could also be that the seconds and the minutes are 8 bit shorts and the hours is a 32 bit unsigned integer. which would mean a little less than 490k years of wait time... also there sure is a way to get a headstart on this, or maybe you'll get an answer from apple support if you make the mail funny enough xd
for those wondering why, it's because it doesn't use optical image stabilization (i.e. the lens itself is fixed -that is unmoving- like the desperate pleas of your crazy ex-girlfriend when you tell her you are never getting back together. what is happening is that when recording in 1080 or lower, the whole 4k sensor is still active, but the software is only saving 1/4 of the pixels- the 1/4 immediately surrounding the dead middle most likely. then, using the various motion sensors, it detects when the camera it's moved and counteracts that movement by changing the "frame" of pixels it is choosing to record in the opposite direction.
you underestimate medical technology. he could live to see 9,999,999 hours or 1,140 years 99,999,999 hours or 11,400 years 999,999,999 hours or 111,400 years 99,999,999,999 hours or 1,114,000 years
32-bit unsigned should only go to 11,930 hours. not exactly sure why 99983 hours would be a limit. they're probably both on 64-bit devices but something else is different. a 64-bit unsigned int would go to 2.562x1013 hours. e: fun fact: you could increment a 64-bit unsigned int every centisecond (100 times a second) and not overflow for 2.95 billion years. e2: woops, i think i used the signed 64-bit value. unsigned would be significantly larger. my bad.
i mean, that's just a nice way of saying he's wrong more often than not. if you don't over- or under-estimate, you're dead on.
i never understood the drama behind 'uge. mericans drop the h in herb all the time
i'm imagine his giant face on the body of a massive sandworm.
remindme! 1277 days "i was reminded one day earlier than all these other scrubs"
it is known that much of australia's population is at least part kangaroo
i thought someone made that up; i didn't realize it was actually from the show.
the examples he gave made it pretty clear what he was saying, he'll intentionally over or underestimate things because he knows that he doesn't know the exact answer so he chooses to be wrong in the direction that will disappoint him less.
wow, bro, this guy waited over a year to do what you did in what, 1hr? :d
it's more about his extremely limited vocabulary than the way he says the word. he's got about a dozen adjectives he uses to describe the world and that's one of the common ones.

i don't know where you got this information from but it's not true. we are mainly part koala
well, then this whole thread is a huge disappointment.

i don't know if he's actually checking out ivanka, but the look hillary gives him tells me he was def looking at something a little too intently lol. that's the look of a woman staring at her man and just thinking "can you believe what this asshole is doing?" also love how bill must have felt her glaring at him, does a quick check, then goes right back at it.
is there any proof to what he was actually looking at? i'm going to assume this is just a clever title to a gif taken completely out of context untill proven otherwise. still funny though.
that moment when bill looks at hillary, then continues looking says everything there is to say about their relationship.
hillarys reponse is the most genuine facial gesture i've seen out of all her debates. finally something human in her. it's the look of...i see you...again...
this is the mental conversations they had. bill to bill: god damn ivanka. the things i would do to you. oooh i can imagine it right now *slightly licks lips* i'd bend you over and slide my pe... hillary to hillary: this mother fucker. he doesn't even realize i'm fucking staring at him. i'm just going to keep fucking staring until he realizes i'm fucking staring at him. that'll get him to stop. bill to hillary: fuck off. hillary to hillary: you mother fucker! bill to bill: bitch. now where were we...
what a girl, at least two presidents want to fuck her.
remember the time when the biggest problem in the country was a blowjob?
hillary scoffs and rolls her eyes, typical william
hahaha best part of the gif. he fades out when he sees hillarys face
gw is fantastic. he may not have been the greatest of presidents, but he seems like such a real dude. i hope i get to meet him someday...but i live in the only state he didnt visit as president...
don't forget about w coming in from the right at the end to invite everyone within earshot to 4-wheeling back at the ranch
that moment when bill looks at hillary, then continues looking says everything there is to say about their relationship.
"get a glimpse and look away" doesn't apply to him
exactly, when she made that look i thought, "oh, i know that look. it may not have been ivanka but he was definitely looking at something a little too much." may have been anything but that look on her face was most definitely, "are you fucking serious right now?!"
bill: "oh you noticed? don't give a fuuuuuck" *goes back and stares*
i think he's spaced out. purely a theory but hillary's look is like 'seriously? you're daydreaming now you weirdo?', and his is like 'yep, it's a good one. i'm going back in''.
and she's like "you have got to be fucking kidding me"
doesn't seem like hillary gives a fuck either, the look on her face is one of a spouse that is in on the game.
i think he looks back, notices that hillary sees him, and thinks "if i keep looking, maybe she'll think i'm looking at something else.. and not guilty of---look at the jugs on that mama...."
the number of negative fucks that bill clinton gives is of such magnitude, that cern has decided to ask him for help with their anti-matter experiments.
you can read his lips. "ivanka". its all there folks case closed.
gw bush : guys you realise you are thinking loudly?
for us who didnt watch the inaguration... did she look good?
let's be honest, at least 3 and probably most of the ones that are alive and not blind. for obama, even if ivanka wasn't his type, i'm pretty sure it would permanently excuse him from future insults from trump. trump would be so emasculated and jealous of obama that he might even respect him.
i just wish he didn't turn it into perjury in federal court... :(
she doesn't even look mad. must just be the standard in their relationship.
this was at a funeral (nelson mandela's, i think?)
when your dick still smell like the ms. and the mrs. ain't happy about it.
it's interesting seeing glimpses of those "house of cards" type of moments in real life
when bill was president he was getting regularly blown by his secretary behind hillary's back. she (understandably) hasn't forgiven him for it.
i think the fact that hillary caught him and smiled about it says much more.
"seriously? you're going to do this today, in front of all these people?"
jesus fucking christ that fake-ass reaction cost her a million votes all by itself.
yeah, until they actually show who was standing where he was looking, i am not gonna jump on this bandwagon of "lol bill = no shame."
i was watching live and this definitely happened as trump's kids were making their entrance
that's what i picture in my head. she knows he fucks around, i'm sure she fucks around too. they stay married for mostly political reasons.
she's not surprised any more. she's just like, geezus bill. the cameras are on us. fer fuck's sake already.
as if bill clinton was the first... using presidential influence to get laid is a great american tradition going back hundreds of years.
yup that's what i thought because that's what i would do. if i stop looking it would show i'm guilty.
i thought he was doing the matthew mcconaughey 'alright'
looks like "all right" to me. he only uses two syllables, and ee-van-ka is three. all right all right all right
she looked stunning to me. i don't like trump, but she's hot.
can you imagine how rowdy it must've been with w. back when he wasn't sober and got up to the booger sugar?
i'm an older liberal who lived through clinton, thought w's election was the end of the world, then got through it... ...i miss w now. i miss obama more, but i miss w.
makes sense. white lady cracking jokes to a black president in front of his* black wife at a black icon's funeral
well house of cards is largely inspired by the clintons, so... makes sense.
and it wasn't the first or last affair he had either. honestly i'm sure she feels that the worst part of the lewinsky scandal was the massive attention and public humiliation it brought.
he loves bad bitches and that's his fucking problem
there is a fain squint, a "are you fucking kidding me" microexpression.
you think thats a fucking smile?? that's a death stare followed by a im-gonna-reck-your-shit when we get home. anyone who has been married for a few years knows that look
"hillary have you seen her? she is spicy as all hell!"
then he keeps looking, as if to say "you're goddamn right."
it's probably just a joke, no need to jump on any wagons.
this sounds really profound, but i have no idea what the fuck it means.
i'm completely convinced they have a house of cards frank and claire underwood type relationship where they're in it for the long game. a couple mistresses and boytoys here and there doesn't matter when you're playing at the level they're at.
married couples can't be compelled to testify against each other.
there is some quite remarkable stories about how kennedy would shuffle girls in and out. kind of makes me want to be president.
can you imagine hanging with him and bill?? it'd be wilder than the hangover.
i mean, yeah that or that it's a funeral and they're heads of state so perhaps a more somber tone is appropriate.
that movie was more hilarious than it got credit for.
i think he said next time he uploads the pod cast he's gonna be a fattthaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
yeah and he likes to fuck, he's got a fucking problem.
yeah... not a native speaker. thought "stop" would work too. it doesn't? maybe it should have been "this never stops entertaining me"?
not the same moment. in the video bill is behind hillary, and there's a man with glasses to michelle's right. in your pic bill and hillary are on the same row, and the man with glasses is on the left, walking towards the center. also, by the direction of bill's look you can see he's looking away from the stage, or at least straight to his right. definetely not ahead, as it would be if he were looking at ivanka
and there's the evidence i needed. now i can jump on the wagon with the rest of the band.
i guess if you're the shadow of a man at noon, he must be standing on top of you.
the underwoods are almost certainly modeled after the clintons and their *alleged* crimes.
this is pretty much spot on. i remember a long interview with dick morris and when hilary was running in 2004, he was asked about bill's cheating why hilary still hadn't divorced him. he said mainly for political reasons. he then said hilary caught bill several times before he ran for governor but stuck with him during his campaign. after he won, she stuck it out. then she was planning on divorcing him after he left office, but then he decided to run for president. then it was her just waiting until he was done with his political career. then he said her political career took off, so instead, she knew she would need him then since he was still so powerful in democratic circles and wanted to try and woo the conservative voters who really believed in the nuclear family and having a father and mother raising kids. it was all for show, more or less.
lbj was even worse. often showed his dick to staffers when he ran out of arguments.
except that she and all of her staffers are apparently too fucking stupid to realize that seeing her pan trump and rail against him like a normal human being was exactly what would have won her a lot more empathy and sympathy as a candidate, rather than having her pretend to be a smug fucking lizard person all the time. i'm pretty sure the humanity is the act, and she's actually the lizard. that's what politics does, makes you stop being a person, because "people don't sell well". until, apparently, a person does sell well.
you will end up having to get rid of a dead hooker.
i was on board the uss abraham lincoln when dubya flew on. i didn't necessarily like him, because we'd just spent 9 months in the fucking gulf, but he was bubbly and cheerful around everyone, shook every hand that he could and took as many pictures as were requested. i appreciated his jubilant nature.
yeah, this actually made me really like michelle obama.
poor white southern democrat who loves junk food and his well-off harvard educated wife?
i think they pull from a number of sources. i've always gotten a john boehner vibe from frank underwood as well, especially the smoking.
no time to source, but i am 99% certain the writer confirmed that theory.
when she was 'herself' back in arkansas and when she was first lady she got nothing but shit. they even blamed bill losing the governorship on her not taking his last name. we get the politicians we demand.
that's weird, i was thinking it made me like them for being able to laugh at a funeral. there damn well better be some good jokes in my eulogy.
i thought the underwoods were based on the clintons when i watched, but they're not. the creator said that hillary is the closest current actual politician to claire, but i don't think he said she was based on her. robin wright says her character wasn't based on hillary. frank is based on the same british house of cards character, francis urquhart, but the creators have mentioned that lbj and margaret thatcher were their initial inspirations for his character.
i agree, i was not a fan of him when he was president (mind, i was very young for most of it and remember mostly through my parents opinion), but he does seem to be a genuinely nice person. i will miss the days when we had only to worry about a stupid president.
if she were my daughter i'd... wait, i got this wrong.
how the hell is he moving so fast once he hits the ground?
every single video of this game is just so fucking awesome.
i swear. titanfall 2 is the coolest game i will never play.
giving me tribes vibes. is it as hard to play as tribes was?
this game had an awesome campaign too. very few games have good pvp and a great story now a days.
and i felt like hot shit when i found out you could use the grapple to swing like spider-man...
this is titan fall 2? that looks awesome. i've been holding out, but i like the outdoors in the field look.
that was possibly greatest gaming clip i've ever seen. if this is what pro gaming was like i'd start watching it.
ironically i just started playing this game tonight after sitting on it since it released. it's amazing. i think i enjoy it more than bf1 and i'm a bf fan boy. shhh
so, do they have an attack on titan mod for this yet?
i wish i had gotten titanfall 2 instead of battlefield 1....
those bhop skills, though. calling back to early cs days.
the only thing i like better about titanfall 1 than 2 is the ai soldiers, in titanfall 1 you could walk into a room and see enemy ai engaged in hand to hand combat with friendly ai, or they would take up positions in buildings and have actual firefights, it made the battlefield feel alive and made the game very immersive. now the ai just stand in the open shooting at each other and missing.
take note people, this is the proper way to repost.
the first few frames of a slide has no deceleration, so alternating between sliding and jumping can conserve a lot of momentum. it started out as a glitch that was wildly popular (kinda like wavedashing in melee) and became a full fledged feature.
if you haven't yet, please do so. it's amazing how great this game is and it sucks that it's seen as a failure because of low sales figures. the developers did almost everything right this time around.
i played doom, i played battlefield 1. i think titanfall 2 is the best fps of the year by far. i really, really love it.
i've played it for at least an hour every single day since it came out and right now i'm thinking about it at work. also, i still need to git gud with the kraber (name of gun used in clip)
if this were tribes, that sentinel kill would've been considered normal
tribes: vengeance was my favorite fps of all time. luh-hoooooooooooo-zerrrrrrrr!! heh heh heh
i'm stealing your picture and using it next time someone uploads this gif for that sweet sweet karma. /s
it's such a photogenic(for lack of a better word) game. almost every match i've played has had a moment where i either went "holy shit" or started laughing manically.
man, that's what it felt like playing halo: combat evolved when first came out. story line, graphics, game play... it redefined the industry.
i always thought it was too short. i'd actually buy a campaign dlc
that's homestead, which is the only map with such an open area. it is also one of the worst maps in the game. i'd say the worst but a lot of people hate crash site too.
yup, and in titanfall 2 there's slidehopping. which is basically bunnyhopping, but it takes you 10 minutes to master instead of always getting better at it, and there's no room to fuck it up. can still do it the hard way in titanfall 2 but it's pretty much superfluous. slightly salty that i spent so many hours trying to git gud at first game, but also glad they've made it more accessible and lowered the skill floor, which was probably too high in the first game.
titanfall 2 is beast and it pisses me off with how many people don't realize that. it was released way too close to battlefield 1 despite it being just as good. you should pick it up if you get the chance, but the multiplayer is pretty dead on pc.
yeah you made the wrong choice. i traded in bf1 to get this and haven't looked back.
same but the quick movements in titanfall plus the awesome mechanics make it superior. honestly kind of amazing how different first person shooters have become from one another
after 15 years of variations of quake being the only fps i really played and stuck with, titanfall was the only other game i tried that scratched that twitch itch. the balance of everything was pretty phenomenal (even between titans and pilots) and the parkour element helped me leave behind rjing in ca.
is it like b-hopping in other source games or is there more to it?
except release it at the same time as bf1, or so i heard :(
not a huge fan of the multiplayer but bt is one of my favorite characters in a shooter in a really long time.
i might have to drop some money on it. it does look fun.
and no player base :( *edit*: apparently the player base has bounced back after the holidays. i shall happily reinstall and give it another whirl!
do i need to have played the first titanfall to enjoy the second?
sorry for jumping into top comment thread but can someone explain to us from /r/all what's going on in this clip? did he use like a grappling hook slingshot or something?
i liked it till i regenerated and realized i was hopelessly average.
i've been on the fence about getting titanfall for awhile but i think i may actually get it.
as a competitive multiplayer shooter, i couldn't agree more. something about doom makes it better as a fps for me, though...might just be nostalgia, talking.
did something happen to this game? i used to play it all the time but am seeing quite a reaction to that comment.
hah. you forgot to spell it the shitty way. now i have no reason to be offended.
i think you mean cinematic lol. i love games like that which is why i enjoy battlefield so much.
too expensive for the size of the player base in australia. i tried it during a free weekend and loved it, but yeah unless they drop the price i'm not spending $80 on a game that i won't be able to play this time next year. also it's not available on steam so it's a lot harder to figure out who on my friends list has the game already and when they're playing.
it's something i like watching other people play, but it's a little too fast paced for my taste. i'll have good matches in games like that, but inevitably i'll end up with some god-mode ritalin munching bastard who makes me feel inadequate enough times that i can no longer perform. so i lose interest and stop playing.
yeah, same. it was so good but so short i finished it in two days.
hmm. from an outsider it looks like caspian border.
i was being sarcastic but neglected to "/s". i got both and prefer titanfall 2 for being so bugnuts crazy. funny thing is: both are ea. they put out competing products around the same time.
in your eyes maybe, but some people might think the weaponry and historic elements in ww1/ww2 games make them superior
i'm getting too old for this shit. now i know how my father felt when he watched me play sonic as a kid.
so legitimate question: if you wait 2 weeks and post in a different subreddit, is it a cross-post or a repost? (i know that wasn't the case here, more of a shower thought i guess)
it's funny to me how some people just can't get that others might not care about karma very much
there's a mechanism in the game that lets you keep your momentum if you slide just as (or just before) you hit the ground. this can be exploited* by jumping out of the slide and immediately triggering the slide again, to keep your momentum entirely and indefinitely as you slide+jump (aka bunny hop) around the level. *i'm undecided if it's actually exploiting the mechanic or if the devs intended it to be a part of the gameplay, for higher play. a similar mechanic was present in the first game as well.
i mean, the timing is fairly tight so there's some skill involved but less than bunny hopping in cs:source or hl. slide jumping locks you into a straight line while you're doing it though, so even if it's a bit easier to do than bunny hopping, it's a bit more limited. of course, titanfall 2 is designed from the ground up with fast movement and mobility in mind, so it's less of a "glitch or tech" issue than bhopping.
that decision wasn't made by the devs, though. ea set that months before it came out.
which is hilarious because tf2 is the far superior game. bf1 is good and all, but tf2 is just phenomenal. fast paced, great guns, awesome movement system, good game modes, fun level design, excellent campaign, oh and **mother fucking titans**
*thrown ~80 meters* "...i think i'm gonna need a new pair of pants." "i'll add that to the next supply shipment." man, i loved bt, too. closest i've felt to a character in a while, despite being non-human.
bt and ethan from infinite warfare for me. i guess im a robot apologist.
there's plenty to not worry about match making. edit - i'm on console so i shouldn't speak for the pc community. hope to join you soon!
i never have any trouble getting into a game. around 4k on pc atm. not incredible but it's definitely not dead. and there are far more people on console.
there's enough to play the game, for now at least, if you're in a relatively popular area (i hear the aussies have it pretty bad). i don't know if there will be enough to keep it going in a meaningful way for more than, say, six months or so... but even six months you'll get your money's worth
no, not at all. it stands alone. pretty well in my opinion, too.
he used a grabbling hook which is a tactical ability. you get two by default and they regenerate. after he hit the ground he started bunny hopping, which isn't really an intended feature, but it requires constant sliding and jumping back into a slide over and over again. it allows you to go way faster than intended.
i'd definitely recommend it. i played doom earlier in the year and thought it'd be my goty until i picked up titanfall 2. campaign was awesome, and multiplayer can be amazing. even matches i lose i still feel like a badass.
i really think they've got something special with the movement system. everything else that other people have mentioned is just gravy for me.
personally, i loved titanfall, but i don't think they're in the same league as far as fps campaigns go. it's no real fault of titanfall itself, but that style of shooter has just become so stale, gameplay wise, over the past few years, that doom's campaign was better just for change of pace alone. plus, doom's weapons are more fun and glory kills give you that giddy feeling that titanfall doesn't come close to.
it went the way of many games. servers come and go. many team vs team fps games have come and gone. i tried planetside for a while but it wasn't the same
everyone feels that way man. in this game, in any game, any hobby really. you could even say that is just life. someone out there will always have more, do more, be more. in my opinion you have two choices once you realize this; either rise up to the challenge and try harder or you could remember to step back and remember that youre also supposed to be having fun. plus the game is not like cod, the game is dynamic enough that it neutralizes those ritalin munching bastards. theres npc ai enemies for both sides that can actually cause enough distraction. also no matter how much dope and godlike reflexes a person has, you cannot take on a titan singlehandedly. titans avoid engaging titans head on. except for toothpaste46, he's got guts
i sat down and played the while thing in about 8 hours. definitely too short, but it was one of the better campaign experiences i've had for sure. that massive titan battle o.o
seriously the web swinging mechanics were what made it for me because they actually took into account buildings and weren't just sticking straight up into the air like magical sky strings
they wanted to steal as much market share for cod: iw as possible, so tf2 was bound to suffer.
considering the top character on the training thing has a slide hopping ghost, it appears the devs also use this technique.
you shut your whore mouth! you just shut it the fuck up... thanks now i'm all sad and angry at the same time. fucking tribes 2 and 3 just ruining starseige:tribes and it's amazing mods. shazbot.
yup. ea fucked respawn good. meanwhile titanfall 2 is way more fun than bf1. there's no comparison.
"somebody's in love!" "a human's concept of love requires admiration, attraction, devotion, and respect. conclusion... i am 50% in love." one of my favorite conversations in that game.
"rendezvoused with major anderson." "haha very funny bt."
on pc you can play attrition easily anytime at all.. mixtape which has almost all the gametypes does ok during peak hours, but late at night, 11+ in hawaii becomes empty. they are reworking the matchmaking into one queue though, where each person says which gametypes they are ok with playing, and then just put em into one of em. the way it is now there are like 13 different options and 9 of em are empty. hopefully it will help a lot because i love titan vs titan.
depends on when you're playing i guess. i play in off peak hours a lot of times and it can be impossible to find a game in most of the game types.
if you're only playing in prime time for your region i wouldn't doubt it. try playing in off peak hours and good luck. routinely see sub ~600 population. easily my favorite fps of 2016 (and by a wide margin at that) but let's not make things up about how deep the player pool is.
this sounds and kind of looks like a combination of tf2* , cod, and overwatch. *tf2 = team fortress 2
the whole escape system makes you feel good even if you lose, which is nice.
the movement system is amazing. there's such a high skill ceiling for it, i have a mad respect for it. my gripe is the fast ttk, so there's little opportunity to utilize it. when i played, everyone just snipped me across map, so no point in trying to run around. the game is a lot of fun, and a massive change of pace from most the aaa shooters.
really? i actually think doom's campaign was more stale by comparison. and i don't mean that to talk shit on doom, it was good. but in terms of comparing i feel doom was the same straight forward "just move forward and kill things." the game felt the same the whole time. titanfall 2 introduced a new mechanic like every other level and never used it again (in a good way). "here is this really awesome amazing thing, okay we're done with it. here's this really awesome amazing thing." preferring doom's campaign is fine, i won't knock that. but titanfall is anything but stale and kept things a lot more fresh than doom's campaign did.
i wanna point out that this gif is from the same guy as the post.
ah, i see. i do miss tribes. that game was a blast. i remember playing that ice level with the spire in the middle with the "hold the flag" game mode ... best memory was getting a hold of that flag a minute or two into the game and not letting go till the end. nothing felt better than getting into the skiing groove in that game, when you're hitting all the slopes absolutely perfectly and the other team can't stop you or even intercept you. fond memories. i don't have much desire to go back but i definitely had fun with it. that's the way it goes with online games though, you're right.
i got battlefield 1 and titanfall 2 in a bundle on origin for $79.99 usd. both were even deluxe editions.
i think i remember hearing about this from some commentary videos by popular titanfall 1 players that got to visit respawn and play titanfall 2 during development. i believe that bunny hopping and air strafing ( moving sideways in mid air for extra momentum and maneuverability) were actually unintended exploits in the first game. however, i doubt the devs would let a bunch of youtubers come wreck their ass in their own game so i assume they take advantage of the skills as well when they play.
the top character is gamesager, who set that mark during the tech test in august. of course, we now have players going sub-20 seconds on the gauntlet.
hah, i'm nowhere near being able to see what the top ghost does, i'll take your word for it!
it's so good that i feel obligated to buy the titan skins so that they will make a kick ass third. hope my 15$ for skins and 50$ for the game gets them there...lol.
eh, i love both games equally. they're just fun in different ways. titanfall is awesome for fast paced ass kicking or if you don't have much time to play. but i love the grand scale of battlefield
there really is no comparison, as they are completely different games that appeal to completely different tastes with widespread game mechanic differences that make them absolutely nothing a like and will obviously suit different fps gamers to their specific tastes.
i must have missed that line. i played through the campaign once and i'm not recalling any of the bt lines people are quoting. does he say different things through multiple playthroughs?
man, i really miss frontier defense, though. it was always my favorite game mode, i was almost devastated to find out it they did away with it entirely.
hmmm, interesting. i've never seen less than 1000 players actually, and the lowest i ever saw was before the christmas sale. it's kept a consistent 2-4k since then, depending on the time. this sunday morning it was around 4000. i don't doubt you, just saying that the player pool isn't as bad as many make it out to be in my experience.
i dunno man, i play off peak hours on pc (like 3-4am even) and i don't think i've ever seen it below 1000 players, or taken longer than 1-2 minutes to get a match for attrition. the other game modes definitely suffer, but the devs are working on that with the new playlist system. i play on us west btw, if that matters.
i love this game because it feels like a combination halo and cod... and the giant robots, those are cool too.
the forced respawn during the escape is my only gripe with it, sometimes i am getting beat so bad and it just feels like the devs are laughing at me as i respawn just to die again seconds later. there should be an opt out that just counts it as you dying without the insult of forcing you to spawn and get shot again.
until those matches where the enemy team has titans and your team doesn't. that shit sucks ass.
i haven't had problems with this. usually i'm just zipping around with the epg or softball having a blast.
is it? i didn't even notice. i just had it saved from when i first saw it.
...yeah, no - you shouldn't be having any stuttering. you say you're using an rx 480? that card should be able to mop the floor with titanfall 2. what monitor resolution are you running at?
bhopping and air strafing were originally bugs from air acceleration in quake and/or doom (can't remember which). they became so popular as pro techniques they were added into other engines up until around the time of source 1.5, when it became easier and more people railed against it. i highly doubt anyone putting that into their game on release in the last 20 years is unaware of that history, instead its kept to give players a way to continue to edge and improve a pro player's capabilities.
i think the records have pretty much topped out at 14 seconds + getting all kills (although you don't really go much faster by skipping the enemies).
i bought bf1 instead of titanfall anecdotal i know
the love quote is from early in the game after you get the first weapon upgrade "tone". i think it's only on level 3 or 4.
dang. i wish that was the case for me. what region are you in? such a great game. would love to dive back in if the players are there.
does it go by data center? i'm looking at 26k on ps4 atm.
was there a player bump recently? might have to reinstall and give it another bash. haven't played since before the holidays myself.
thank god, on the titan fall sub, there are all these people saying that they just got the game and love it, but they are all console players and i'm sitting here with empty game modes on pc
oi mofo, your teammates are relying on you to help each other escape, so you need to suck it up!
tf1 you had one chance to make it to the escape zone. i like that system better, it added a little more thrill and sense of accomplishment to making it to the ship
pilots can do a lot of damage to titans if you can stay in cover. then your team will be the ones with the titans.
i would bet that its either too much antialiasing or a weird amd vs nvidia optimization thing
the one that looks like a squarish electronic thing?
you own titanfall 2, right? would you be able to tell me what settings you have on?
do you notice the stuttering only with titanfall, or is it in other games too?
actually, i do get stuttering on other games aswell. also screen tearing.
i'm a former scientologist and sea org member. i was raised in scn and joined the so as a 15-year-old girl and was in for six years. i'm still dealing with the effects of the abuse i endured in the so. i just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken. i feel like even when people are rightly negative about scn, they still don't really get it, and it's difficult to talk about. so, thank you for doing what you're doing, and for being an example for someone that gets it. what has helped you get through the leaving process and the intimidation from the church?
is it true they record your meetings and blackmail you with the recordings?
if all scientology's secrets were revealed tomorrow, which do you think would be most shocking?
are you still in contact with any friends that are still part of the church?
when you were a scientologist did you ever get any weird reactions from other famous people?
was there a secret group of people or friends you had in the church that doubted it? or did you feel alone.
do you think there are members of the cult of scientology reading this ama?
how are they able to recruit intelligent people into what appears to be an obvious scam and cult?
considering that scientology is consistently painted in such a negative light how did you maintain the commitment to scientology for so long?
what is something the average citizen can do to help prevent scientology growth?
do the higher ups know it's a scam or do they really believe this crap?
was there a single breaking point that convinced you to leave the church? or was it a long term struggle with the decision?
over the past 10 years, i've seen my parents get deeper and deeper into scientology. decent reasoning, science and logic have done nothing to convince them to question the church. from someone who left, is there anything a loved one can do to help a brainwashed member see the truth, without ruining the relationship completely?
are people actively being held prisoner against their will? if so, how upsetting is it that the government and law enforcement does not act?
what odds do you give of the whole thing collapsing once miscavige dies?
do you remember what your initial reaction was upon first seeing the course materials for ot3?
i've been a huge fan since the early days of koq (was watching at 11, now 24!). did you ever find that your religion interfered with your work in a way you would turn town any potential jobs, either for your own religious reasons or advice received from members?
why do you think there are so many people in the entertainment industry in the religion?
what do members actually gain from being a member? how is it made worth all the money and time they invest?
are there any sexual malpractices that occur in the church?
do you personally feel like you're being watched/tracked/etc by the church for doing everything your doing?
how do the powers that be in scientology keep their followers from reading anti-scientology news, or your book? why don't more scientologists leave?
have any other actors come to you for support or help?
you are so brave for telling the truth about scientology. why are so many other people staying quiet? what can we do to help?
i guess i have two questions. first, a little context: years ago a family friend's wife started getting into scientology. she started doing the therapy and seemed to be doing really well for a while. after a year or so she started getting really strange about normal human/bodily functions. she started talking about how going to the bathroom was "unclean," sex was "disgusting and unnatural" and stopped sleeping. eventually a church official came to her husband's house and explained that she needed to go away to get better. they took her somewhere but wouldn't allow her family any contact. about six months later she died wherever they brought her and the church release her body sans autopsy to the family for burial. so here they are: 1. what could the religion have done to make her lose like that? 2. where would the church have taken someone in her condition?
what's is the single most horrible thing you encountered in the ""church""?
how different would you say your view of hollywood is now compared to when you were on saved by the bell and did your experience with scientology effect these views versus if you never joined them?
what is your overall opinion on organized religion now? did your view on say christianity change?
from what i've seen of scientology, it seems like there is a major difference in treatment between celebrity "followers" and folks in sea org who are tortured, locked in the hole, beaten publicly by miscavige, etc. did the news of this mistreatment find its way to celebrities and general "members" of the church who weren't in sea org? or were people left completely in the dark?
as a psychologist, i am curious what you observed as mental health 'treatment' with scientology? in addition, i am aware the 'church' is against psychology; how was this opposition demonstrated within or by the 'church'? finally, in your opinion how prevalent are mental health difficulties with the scientology community? thank you for your time.
did being a scientologist help your acting career?
we can (almost correctly) assume that celebrities receive special treatment because of their status - could you elaborate more on that? for instance, how would your experiences in the church differ from someone who is not a celebrity? and a follow up - do you think that more celebrities would like to break free from the church but are afraid because of the repercussions? is there any merit to the claim that there's so much dirt on them that could be exposed that they may not want to leave? hope you convince others to follow your path!
what was the first red flag you noticed about scientology?
are you an theist now or does another religion seem more appealing?
goddamn this post has gotten over 5000 dislikes in the past few hours, this was over 12k upvote at 5:00. major shout out to leah for putting herself out here to answer are questions, and anyone who is down voting, why? scientologists who follow their doctrine should not be on this site, so i am assuming mist of the down votes are other people. how do you feel on this issue? what do you agree/disagree with?
former sea org member in recovery here. what do you hope to accomplish with your expos'e? edited to thank some kind people for pm's and also to thank the angry people that doubt me. the fact is i'm telling the truth, but wish i wasn't. i was born into a church that ruined my family, took many of my good years, and hard earned cash. believe what you will.
so, xenu. when do you first learn about him when you join the church?
hi leah, what are your thoughts on louis theroux's recent ' my scientology movie'?
in germany many schools make scientology a topic in school (mostly in social studies, religious education or ethic class) and try to teach children about the risks - often by inviting people who left scientology. is there anything similar in the us and would you think it is a good way to avoid getting into scientology? about 20 years ago we had a woman in school who did a lecture about scientology. she left the church and talked about how scientology went after her for about a year. they sent people to her family telling them what a bad person she was and she had guys in cars following her everywhere she went until she got help from the police - happened in germany in the 90s. it helped me a lot to understand scientology as an organisation and it's often compared with the propaganda and influence of the nazis on the german youth back in the 1930s.
what drew you to scientology in the first place? or rather, why did you stay with the church for so long?
are there ex-scientology rehabilitation groups? just curious.
very much so. i thought it was very accurate. i was shocked how accurate it was for not coming from scientologists. i wanted to see more stories about how it affected children. the systematic recruitment of members' children. i wish it would have told the story of how scientologists give their children to the "church." it protects the life source that is continually bolstering the religion. but, i think they did an amazing job and they cleared the path for people like me to speak about it. hbo was very brave in taking it on. as is a&e, as it will be the first network is do a full series about it.
when you reach the top of the bridge (otp 8) you will be told that god is a lie for lrh, and there are more levels ahead, that will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. there is no end to scientology.
i am an sp (supressive person). you are not allowed to be in contact with an sp. i would love to talk to my former friends and see my goddaughter.
do i think? i know. hi karin pouw and members of osa! if any sea org member is currently reading this and works for osa and wants to leave, i will help you... including karin.
most scientologists are 2nd or 3rd generation, they were born and raised into an ideology and have been surrounded and isolated. it is all they know. they are victims. most of the original scientologists are all out and have spoken out. unfortunately, their children were indoctrinated by them.... are still loyal, faithful and have cut off communication due to the policy of disconnection.
because i was taught to believe that the controversy was due to people being unaware of what scientology was truly doing in the world which was good things. i also felt the press was focused on making fun of scientology and not what was important, so it was easy to turn away from the information. and also a major part of scientology is learning how to fight your critics. if i wasn't fighting i wasn't being a good scientologist.
speak to your local councilmen/women about cracking down on the abuse of its citizens. i believe people have influences, they know judges, lawyers, police enforcement i think everyone bringing attention to these abuses can help. it takes a community to police itself.
the higher up is singular. and he definitely knows. however i believe most parishioners and sea org members (people who work for the "church") are int he dark and believe that they are doing amazing things for the world. and david miscavige is directly responsible for that fraud.
if you want to get them out there is no way to do it nicely. there is no way to do it quietly. you have to challenge them by saying, "if you can think for yourself, if you have truly accomplished what scientology says you have accomplished, you should be able to speak freely on any subject. if you have completed the "pts/sp course" you should be able to confront and shatter suppression." you should ask them how is it then that you can't watch a movie called going clear or look on the internet if you are the elite of the planet and handling the planet's ills if you can't think for yourself. i only hope that your challenge will get them to simply look.
it's very upsetting. i'm only an actress with a short window of interest. so it is up to the authorities who have to do something about it and the judges who are hearing cases of abuse, coerced abortions, being held prisoner, fraud, mental and emotional imprisonment. they won't look at cases to decide its a religion. they have to separate and look at the law. your doctrine is abusive. it mandates that you abuse people.
yes my first reaction was "are you all fucking nuts?" and then i looked at my mother and said "what kind of bullshit did you get me in?" my only option was to leave, but at the time my family was not ready to go. the "church" told me i didn't need to believe it, just do it. and they always pose this question: "are you ready to leave everything you've ever known?"
i was punished for doing stuff magazine because it was too racy. they would not want us to do anything that would be considered not "becoming of a scientologist." i see they have since changed their stance of what they believe is "becoming of a scientologist."
if you really look at the numbers at the entertainment industry, in comparison to the small number of scientologists that are celebrities, the number wouldn't even register. i think scientology has done an amazing job convincing people that there is a great number of celebrities in the "church."
i heard a theory that it's actually a giant money laundering scheme for the members. after all, once it goes through the church it becomes tax exempt.
they gain a purpose. they gain a group. they gain a sense of accomplishment (awards, certificates). they gain an education that in the real world lrh states would be equivalent to getting a "phd in life." you become an elitist. that you have all the answers in life. if you have a question about life, you are made to think that scientology has the answer.
i am. i'm okay with it because i knew what i was getting into and i knew the policies of the "church" and what would happen by my speaking out against it.
after watching a few documentaries about scientology, i would bet money on the fact that she is being watched and followed by them.
as old spirits in little bodies who have returned to scientology... children are treated as adults.
yes, i feel very safe. i have the support of my family and friends. and, i feel strangely protected by the world at large.
i would say the "church's" fair game policy, and how they systematically go after anyone who publicly speaks out against them. anyone who speaks out against the "church" is seen as an enemy.
no, and if they did hear about it, we were told that those claiming abuse were lying. then i would have been interrogated and even punished for asking.
the "church" doctrine thinks that fields of psychology and psychiatry are a sham. they deny mental illness and afflictions. they promote that you can heal your psycho-sematic issues with their "technology." they will get in the way of people taking medications. they will prevent people from getting the real medical help that they need. and in some cases have caused suicides because of it. scientology is mentally abusive because we are all taught that we are responsible for everything.
i don't want to destroy scientology. i only want them to admit to the fraud that they promote, to not deny the confidential upper levels of the religion, so people can decide if they want to spend $250k and their lives doing it. that they admit to the policies of fair game. that they allow people to decide for themselves where they get their information. that they admit to disconnection and leave families the fuck alone.
i don't what rumors we're referring to here. i haven't read anything that has been inaccurate.
we had special course rooms in separate parts of the buildings. any complaint we had about the outside world was met with agreement from the "church." we were serviced differently, we had supervisors doing courses in our homes, giving special schedules to celebrities. staff was interrogated by the church. often times there were sea org members working for celebrities in their homes, personally working for them. i know of one celeb who had a sea org member working in their home and sea org members were averaging $25/week. the labor laws don't apply to any church therefor they were made to work ungodly hours, forced into interrogations if making human mistakes around the celebrity.
doesn't look like got to this comment, but she said in another response that her first step to leaving was how quickly the "church" would turn on anyone who wronged them, even people who dedicated their lives to scientology.
greater awareness. exposing the truths. not letting to continue to let them bully people into silence and submission.
they don't tell you about xenu until you're at ot iii - operating thetan level 3. you won't get that far until you've spent many thousands on auditing and classes. most people never make it that far. the thing is, xenu is actually an incredibly important part of the religion. it's the explanation of why there is so much suffering on earth. it'd be like if christianity didn't let you know about the crucifixion until you'd donated egregious sums of money to your church.
from what little research i've personally done, it seems like the super early "getting your life on track" and "self help" seminars and such they promote are actually useful. it seems that after that it starts to go all crazy and over bearing. they have to bait the hook with something anyways.
jenna miscavage hill's book, beyond belief, is an incredible account of what it was like to grow up in the "church" as a child of high ranking sea org members. it's fucking scary. so happy for everyone who has left.
how difficult would it be for a parent to leave with their children? have there been instances of the "church" fighting custody battles to try and get the children back?
oh my gosh, just reading through all your responses...you're going to save lives, if you haven't already. good for you. you should be so proud of your bravery.
i was raised in the jehovah's witness religion cult. i've gotten the same question and my answer is very close to yours lol.
what "good things" does the "church" think it is doing?
that's some next level shit, boggles my mind that it exists
how do they punish you? financially? physically? psychologically?
people have accused the church of blackmailing participants, perhaps by using incriminating/ sexual photos or secrets that come out during auditing. hollywood has been accused of doing the same thing to "starlets" and child actors, as a grooming process. do you see any similarities between how young actors are "controlled" and how the church of scientology treats its members?
which is why in her autobiography she spilled all her (and her family's) dirty laundry so they'd have nothing to hold over her head
i imagine there are people from the "church" here right now monitoring every comment and question along with any response from her.
well we know you're doing this and if you suddenly go silent, well.... that'll be suspicious.
how is it that you are still able to speak out against them? what is different about your situation than the others that have tried and been shut down?
accurate enough for the "church" to put people on matt and trey to find dirt (the two are actually quite boring) and then enough to squeeze comedy central to never air the episode again.
loving this ama. i'm surprised the government hasn't cracked down on these psychos by now. then again depressingly enough, it's probably because the feds and states side with them.
seriously, i used to be ashamed admitting i blew a $20k settlement in my 20's on bullshit and weed. i can only imagine coming to that realization.
they probably don't. what i think she means is that they don't sit you down and threaten you before they do it, which she doesn't consider technically blackmail. it's probably what their legal team argues too, but i still think it's blackmail.
i think one of the scariest things about jenna hill's book is that if he let his own niece be treated like that, imagine what happens to everyone else not related to him!?
she is an amazing person and, honestly, i knew her for quite a while and never knew the connection. truly one of the most genuine and sweet people i've ever known.
hmm... nobody has gotten this far, quick, make up some more shit, we've got a real sucker this time.
probably more than you think. all cults are very similar in the environment they promote. i read the ex-jehovah's witness subreddit quite often and there are constant posts by people who are still in but scared to do anything about it.
yeah yeah, we totally saw her... she was hanging with kim's wife, honest
seriously... i keep reading through all of her comments and keep seeing the word, "punished." wtf are they doing to people?
i think in going clear it said they were using his homosexuality to blackmail travolta to keep him in check.
yup get it out of the way so nothing else is surprising. "but you had a!....wait...ok but certainly this!...hm..." makes your credibility way harder to take down.
check out the documentary going clear (2015) . the punishments can get physically and mentally hardcore (beating, humiliation...)
they would lose their status in the cult or have secrets revealed about them. it's blackmail. they can't stop them from doing anything as evidence by leah being here now.
the cult still has dirt on them that they don't want released. my question is what kind of shit could they have on someone that the public would really give a shit about?
explains a lot of the weird stuff around suri cruise. also, leah said she hasn't read anything that is innaccurate. i wonder if that includes that claim that scientology believed suri cruise was lrh?
*2 years from now* til leah remini was last heard from after doing a reddit ama about scientology
1. celebrity. its easier to take down a no-name critic than a celebrity in the public eye. 2. she's coming out with all the details of her time with the church on her own. the most common blackmail they use is threatening to tell about things you did in the church if you ever become a critic. if you get there first, they have nothing left to stand on. 3. its been easier for ex-members to come forward since a lot of the details of the abuses of the church were brought to light in the late 2000s, early 2010s with operation chanology. laugh all you want about anonymous and 4chan being superheroes for a minute, but it really was an effective campaign at bringing attention to the cult.
hell of a lot more visibility and fame than a regular person.
this was literally her final response. what have you done?!
they tried, the irs attempted to take them off tax exempt status and in return the "church" infiltrated the irs and threatened the life and well being of the irs director and his family.
it was almost like she was abused worse *because* she was related to the leader. it makes no sense.
it appears she truly does want to leave as she hasn't responded. the only logical conclusion is she is being held against her will
i live near the "celebrity center" and see a lot of sea org members. another couple groups they seem to prey upon are immigrants and actors. especially actors. they are constantly offering free "acting classes" which they promote heavily around hollywood, targeting areas where they know new actors wind up. for instance, if you register at central casting, a company that casts extras for film and television, there is always a group of sea org members handing out pamphlets for the "classes."
it has to be more than that, doesn't it? would anyone really care if travolta came out?
have they ever revealed secrets of any celebs before?
oh, wow, that would make so much sense. think about the name. they call her suri, like the surrogate bodies in that bruce willis movie, surrogates. she is a surrogate body for lrh's soul. freaky.
during an investigation, police suddenly decided it was a suicide for sure
i take personal pride in having been called a suppressive person by a church handler, though luckily i don't have a .45 shaped hole in the back of my head for my trouble.
leah didn't believe artie lange was in old school because she was in it and never saw him. meanwhile he was totally in the beginning and end of the movie. they just never had a scene together.
shall we round up the mob, pitchforks and torches, maybe go bust her out?
scientology - when a movie script gets mistaken for a religion.
doesn't matter if anyone cares as long as they can make him believe people care. and there definitely are people that care.
there were claims made by ex scientologists that her bedroom was prepared for lrh. they had his favorite books and his robe laid out on the bed. that she was served his favorite meals. things of that nature. then you have the stuff the media grabbed a hold of where she was dictating major decisions for her parents, more or less controlling every aspect of her own rearing. if scientologist children are treated like adults, suri was treated like an adult with authority. allegedly.
very different populations. the 4chan of 10 years ago is nothing like the 4chan of today.
i got id'd, followed, harassed, and shoved by the local osa head (hi, cathy!) when i was part of chanology back in houston and austin in 2008. "always attack, never defend" was not something they were prepared to have turned back on them... nor was the rasterbated poster about how female sea org members were forced to have abortions.
you obviously havent seen any of the mission impossible movies. tom cruise will kill us all. please mr.cruise spare us!
scientology - when a movie script gets *rewritten* for a religion.
pffft. all i have to do is put my hand on his forehead to hold him back. we've got reach that tom could only dream of!
seeing as she seems to believe she is the reincarnation of l ron hubbard? geez, was anything in the south park episode wrong?
4 separate attacks at 4 separate locations in paris per cnn. this is very coordinated. multiple gunmen/bombers involved.
important: if you're stuck in paris, the city of paris has a free emergency number, 0800406005. the city asks people to stay inside their homes, and to host anyone who is stuck outside.
no matter how many times something like this happens, i still get sick to my stomach. it's just overwhelming to think about people who won't get to go home to their lives ones because of senseless violence. thinking of the family and friends of those involved.
if you are in paris outside right now, and want shelter, there's #porteouverte on twitter, people will help you !
interview on cnn summary: 1 - the person interviewing was inside "it was a blood bath: 2 - people were stepping over people trying to escape 3 - the shooters were quiet (one was young, 20years old), they were saying nothing. 4 - shooters were unmasked, were calm, reloaded. 5 - they were shooting in random directions, still many hostages inside 6 - his friend is still stuck inside, texting him, saying police has not entered yet. reddit crashed.
my mother is there right now and her husband and her were supposed to be at the one of the sites. we cannot get ahold of them. does anyone know any ideas how to?
important if you are outside in paris check #porteouverte on twitter. we open our doors to people in need of safety. **edit : please do not flood this hashtag on twitter, leave it for emergency purpose only (ie. if you are looking for or offering a safe place).**
actually sounds like fighters have been scrambled here. east anglia uk
bbc reporter sinking to the depths of kay burleigh. he seriously asked an obviously shaken witness from the bar if he could the bodies and to describe them. witness said he'd rather not and interview ended but that left a really bad taste in my mouth. edit because it was pointed out that i missed a word. he asked if he could see the bodies and describe them. sorry!
apologies if this seems trivial or tangential to anyone, but... at bataclan theatre where there's currently a hostage situation, eagles of death metal were performing tonight. how could anyone possibly predict going to an eagles of death metal gig on a friday night in paris would end up in a life-threatening hostage situation? young people celebrating together the joy of music. killed for nothing. i want our fucking world back.
bbc already drawing conclusions between this shooting and the reports of the death of jihadi john.
god dammit, why paris? such a beautiful city full of culture attacked time and time again.
well at least they made it a quick, easy number to dial....
thanks for the info stay safe and take care of your brother
how is this not top comment? "starting from this date" everyone please be safe for the days to come.
wow, is this real? a year ago. i'm googling this date for france now. thx
this should be higher up. i wonder if the poster is complicit.
totally random too. the chances of being a victim are nil. i couldn't help but think to myself, if only i had chosen to go to that *other* restaurant i was thinking about. are family not just tortured by those questions and the completely random and senseless nature of it?
i hope those who really need it are able to use it.. whole world is tweeting it..
it scares me more that were unmasked. they knew their death was going to happen. these are dead men terrorizing the living.
holy shit. this is going to be an infamous day in french history.
this needs to be higher up. please don't make the same mistake as last time. do not tip off any police activity and leak it on social media!!!
this comment should move further up. i remember 26/11 mumbai attacks where terrorists were actually getting all the police/army operation details from national media which helped them alot.
if this is true this is too insane and horrible to even believe
i strongly suggest making an appointment to see a therapist asap, because once the shock wears off it's gonna hit you like a ton of bricks.
please help encourage people not to put their home addresses out publicly in tweets. who knows what other individual crazy fucks that may be part of this terrorist group are out there and will try to capitalize. i'm encouraging people to give personal information via pm. ps: be careful out there guys. my prayers are with all of you.
i am following this with the feeling that this senseless violence is tearing the world apart but brings also together. we stand with you, from the netherlands
i can only speak for america, but know we are thinking about you guys..know you have the worlds support
am i reading this right?? someone posted about the attacks before they happened??
for those not aware, people cheer due it being a somewhat common occurance. there are always some cool guys who smuggle in fireworks at games, then when one goes bang everyone goes ole!, as to cheer his smuggling success. and also stadiums capture the noise so it's always loud af.
that's really chilling, but i have to ask. if a group of people is being killed 1 by 1, why not fight back?
i rarely get upset over things that don't happen near my country but fuck this shit makes me infurious... how can we make a change to this fucked up world? greetings from finland, stay strong europe.
yep it was disgusting. his name is tim willcox. i'm going to complain.
don't ring, you don't want to draw attention to them.
this sounds to preplanned to be retaliation. the france germany game several attacks at once. they may claim it's retaliation but it seems clearly planned for a while now.
maybe because no one would notice if they did it in the middle east?
france24 is pretty damn good, even for events outside france.
it has a video bar at the bottom of that pic. he obviously changed his profile pic after it happened. no conspiracy here.
just checked the tag, 95% of it is just people saying you can go there for help.
look, i don't want to defend them and i won't. do you think that the only countries fighting islamic extremism are the western ones? i lost a good 1/4 of my family in a massacre at tzi ouzu during the algerian civil war, i served in the military to get rid of these people. we hate them just as much as you do.
wow, i felt that, they need to get in there this isn't a negotiaton situation at all.
europe is going to be more xenophobic than ever if this turns out to be muslim extremists.
what's the "last time" you're referring to? what happened?
i could not agree more with this. i escaped the bosnian war when i was 10. i was fine during my teens (though slightly socially anxious and awkward i suppose but isn't that normal?) - it didn't hit me until i was in my 20s. now i go to therapy 3 times a week for ptsd. the trauma crawled up into my head very fucking slowly but when it did, i went insane. got addicted to coke, went to rehab (been 9 years clean), suffered insane mood issues which came out of nowhere and then i was diagnosed with severe epilepsy. don't fuck around with trauma man. best to see a therapist immediately.
don't take the metro or buses; just be safe. **edit** /u/garnerslight: lines 4, 5, rer b are back open under heavy security now. but don't use them, unless you absolutely must stay safe.
eagles of death metal is a side project of queens of the stone age's josh homme
could you imagine if these bombs went off after the game? i'm assuming that was the goal here. the casualties would have been so much worse with the streets flooded with soccer fans.
yes, that seems like the same modus operandi used by terrorist groups. randoms attacks, explosions, ak47, and now a hostage crisis. i'm so sad, so mad, so tired of this shit.
how come this keeps happening to france? why is paris a target for the 2nd time this year only for terrorists?
everyone's jumping to conclusions and saying this is another muslim terror attack, even though there's no evidence of that. problem is, everyone's right.
yeah, this wasn't something that was thrown together in the last 12 hours. this type of attack (multiple gunmen, multiple targets) takes months to plan. i'm afraid of what's coming america's way though. the french, russians, and americans all recently stepped up their military campaigns against isis, and france and russia have been hit recently.
during the hostage situation 10 months ago at the super-kasher, bfm tv, the most popular french 24/7 "instant" news channel, broadcast the call of a woman hidden in the supermarket with a group of people, while terrorists were still in the building, thus putting their lives in danger. right now, they seem to be doing exactly what smithrereen is warning against. don't give them more views, please.
op once you find yourself in safety, make sure to check you have no injuries. shock can cause injuries to go unnoticed after a particularly traumatic event
this is my second day here. first trip to europe. quite the experience.
worse in terms of casualties, but in terms of exposure i think it fits their agenda to have it heard during a football game (most famous sport in europe) between the two big central countries of europe.
they have the highest muslim population of a western european country, thus with all the tensions going on with isis, it's more likely to happen in france
and please seek counseling quickly to avoid ptsd. quick counseling soon after the event helps significantly to avoid or minimize ptsd. so glad you are safe op. and so sorry you had to experience this.
makes me wonder about germany though - true, germany doesnt have as much of a history with colonies and also a noticeable muslim population which immigrated here in the 60s...but so far we had no terror attacks ("only" domestic terrorism with raf and nsu), is germany doing more for its immigrants or are we just lucky (i know some of the 9/11 guys lived in hamburg but germany was never a big target apparently)?
please be careful with starting counselling too early. it's possible make ptsd symptoms worse. source: i'm a psychologist in training
a similar thing has kind of become a meme in german protest culture. people regularly bring signs along the lines of "i'm so mad, i even brought a sign!", always gives me a good chuckle.
that's nice and all sign guy, but trump barely got more votes than mccain, who was absolutely slaughtered by obama. the democrats were the problem this time around. trump just turned out the usual republican coalition.
so serious question, what exactly are people protesting? i don't like trump either but it's not like he didn't win the election, and they don't seem to be protesting anything specific about that
let's be clear here. protesting the candidate and his views is one thing, but protesting the results is another. please refrain from the latter.
it's the molecular drawing of the mitochondria. ***fyi, the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell***
[](/rdtwistare)i can't tell if that's photoshopped or not.
not a bad sign. if you protest a lot for different issues you could end up making a ton of signs. it is wasteful to make that many, especially if you also protest against deforestation. this allows an easy go to sign for any situation.
its become a huge part of music festival culture. people always holding signs with creative things on it. one of my favourites from shambhala this year was a jar of smuckers and the words "this is my jam". it's tons of fun. then there's the artist specific signs. at space jesus for example, there was a sign that said "if we don't sin then space jesus died for nothing." at bleep bloop one read "in bleep we bloop." that one is simple but makes me giggle as i trip balls listening to good music.
whoever wins the swing states gets a much larger boost to the electoral vote than the popular vote. since obama won the swing states, the electoral college worked in his favor to boost him well above where he'd be based just on the popular vote. 53% of the popular vote but 68% of the electoral votes. it's just how it works
wrong, obama got voters who usually dont vote. those are not "dem voters". hill only got more votes in liberal strongholds.
"you snobby liberal elitists were sooo sure i wouldn't come to your fancy party and shit my own pants, but i did! maybe next time you'll listen!"
all i took away from this is that i still want to fuck coulter, so badly.
i don't think they are protesting that he won. they are saying fuck what he stands for.
he lost the popular vote and won by electoral college. before the election he denounced the electoral college. it is the same as saying points are a bad way to score a football game but when it's 21 to 20 you change your mind and say you won fairly. *changed, "call the game" to, "say you won fairly". lot of analogy critics round these parts...
damn right- get out and make a noise. the lbj administration admits that the numerous protests played an enormous role in withdrawing from the vietnam war.
that's why if i ever end up in prison i'm gonna introduce myself as "the mitochondria" then they'll all know
if men think this is what a vagina looks like no wonder so many women aren't satisfied.
[](/shopdotmov) either way, now i want a giant straw.
that was awesome, i've never heard of father ted but i have a feeling i'm going to love it. thank you for that!
hi, i am the stranger you gave the sign to. thank you.
how about that. i am a great admirer of your product! you should mass market these, i'd buy one. good for many occasions. unfortunately there may be increasing need for them.
::buurp:: you know what morty, none of this is going to matter anyway. ::burrrrp:: these are petty squabbles morty, they will tire each other out then go back to business ::burrrrrrrrp:: as usual. now what do you say we go to blips and chitz, huh?
i'm tentative, but he won with the odds stacked against him. i'm going to reserve my judgements until he actually does something and hope that i was wrong about him.
did you feel the same way after 2008 when obama was elected president and democrats had a majority in both the house and the senate?
i really don't like the idea that not voting means complaining is off limits. basically that idea prompts more inaction and doesn't get people to vote.
i dunno. that sounds more like something you should be saying about trump, whose margin of victory was razor thin in terms of actual votes but healthy in terms of electoral college votes. obama got ten million more votes than mccain and six million more votes than romney. clinton may get a close to a million more votes than trump, but probably not. obama /crushed/ mccain and had a really good showing against romney. trump barely won.
preaching to the choir there, bud. just kind of wishing that more people recognized that shit before november 8.
please stay safe during your peaceful protests. a lot of people are afraid right now, and fear causes people to make poor choices.
be careful. the republicans want an excuse to put pence in charge.
can you source a couple of those? i have to be honest, as a brit, i'm struggling to believe you on: "repeatedly made insinuations", which sounds misleading because how you read an insinuation is entirely subjective. "repeatedly praised dictators and sided with tyrants" sounds like rampant hyperbole. the rest i've definitely seen sources for previously, so they're good. but these sound like tall tales i'd like actually verification on.
but it shouldn't be. the daylight between obama and clinton in terms of their policy preferences is next to nothing. but people aren't motivated by policy, they're motivated by affinity. in a polarized country the most important thing might be that democrats don't fucking vote.
he knew all along. they all know each other. they are actors on the political stage. part of the job of politician is to be able to be a tv personality. to present a character. maybe he had to gulp down some conscience.
whats the end goal for protests though? resignation of president who was elected via democratic election? considering he hasn't even been sworn in nor caused damage to society, what are we protesting about?
at least two of those women are from oitnb if i'm not wrong...
wonder how penises against hillary would have gone down.
this is what gay men think a vagina looks like source: am gay men
[](/secretponythread "you're not supposed to blankpost!") i agree, completely shopped
shit man, father ted is one of the best comedies of all time in my opinion. i just hope for your sakes it has aged well. it was created by graham linehan (black books, it crowd) let me know if you have trouble finding it i, i can try and send it over. everyone deserves to watch ted xxxx
you beat cancer and then went back to work at the carpet store? laaaaaame.
what i mean is that america - the majority of its citizens - are not bigots. i actually don't even think the majority of trump voters are bigots - many voted (misguided imo) out of anger at "the system", or loss of jobs, or trade. so even if we through some mechanism elected this man, we as a country are not him. i am with you, and didn't mean at all to minimize the reality of what's going on. trump's words and policies to me are blatantly prejudiced and terrible. and he emboldened a lot of hate here and abroad, and it really bothers me that people question the legitimacy of people's fears right now. i know people who are terrrified, and also some who are already victimized - not physically, but words hurt well enough. it's happening, absolutely. which is my point. that's not *us*. we can step in, stand besides the people being targeted, and refuse to let this bullshit become the new normal. we *have* to.
he uh lost me during the campaign when he kept repeating at every rally a story about dipping bullets in pig's blood before shooting muslims. kind of not going to reserve my judgments after that.
no. i didn't. i justify that by the fact that: -i was 11 -obama never said he wanted to sue people who were playing recordings of him talking -obama never said he wanted to create a legal team designed to throw john mccaine in jail for a scandal that produced absolutely nothing in terms of legal aciton -obama never said the gadaffi was a strong leader, and that maybe saddam had some points -obama was never accused of sexually assaulting twelve women
i think the issue is that it's trump and lots of neo-conservatives, not the same as when bush won in 2000 which people were surprisingly handling well considering that had even more controversy in who should have won. if say kassich had won with the popular vote and had a conservative congress i could see that going better.
major difference then is that there was still scalia in the supreme court to keep an eye on them. with a trump-selected justice in place, there will be no single check against the gop in any branch of federal government outside of the potential morality of individuals within the party. the progress on federal healthcare is certainly going to be curtailed (obamacare was never a full solution, just a step towards a real system). roe v wade could finally be overturned. a climate change skeptic led epa will almost certainly harm any advancement for alternative energy usage. the gop have established much of their common values largely as staunch opposition to progress (you can get into the billions spent by lobbyists for the benefiting parties to explain this but the reason isn't important right now). two years of unchecked power to push any agenda *could* be disastrous for much of society and the world as a whole.
i tried and it wasn't enough. i live in a state that voted for trump by huge margins and every time i go out of the house now i feel like i'm surrounded by people who have made themselves willingly deaf to the truth.
exactly what i told my kid, the time to get upset and be active was a month, two months, six months, a year ago, not the day after the election. it's over, we lost, be upset, and get ready to fight the coming bullshit every step of the way, but protesting the election isn't going to change anything.
i am on my phone but if i will revisit this tomorrow with links since trying to paste them all from various tabs is hell on mobile. i agree that insinuations can be read subjectively so let me say that he has objectively said aloud on tape that he'd have to sue journalists for libel when said journalists hadn't committed it, and that he has objectively said in interviews firstly that kim jong un is amazing and strong, that putin had amazing approval ratings (as if putin s approval ratings are factual), and that when duterte called obama the son of a whore it was ok cos obama is a weak leader. brb with links
hello did you happen to catch the results of the recent election? 8 years of obstructionist bullshit reaped huge dividends. if the far right stops kicking the dems in the stomach, it will be on account of leg cramps, not respect for the stoic way they've taken it for a decade.

i see pennsatucky and leanne from oitnb. ironic, i suppose, as trump is the new orange.
last i checked clinton didn't brag on tape about being able to do anything and grab men by the penis when you're famous.
me too, that shit's scary. it looks like a fucking mouth.
[](/trixieoh)it always catches me off-guard to see this in a normal subreddit.
me and my wife loved black books and it crowd. another one we loved but was really trippy was the mighty boosh. it's where "old gregg" comes from.
holy shit! this guy took roy totally off the grid!
there were three types of trump voters in this election. those who supported his bigotry, those who excused it, and those who ignored it. all three types rewarded it. i tend to think of our social media feeds as a sort of selfie. they're choreographed and reworked to fit our self image. by contrast, elections are like candid photos of our society, raw and more representative of reality. in many cases, we don't like how we look in such pictures, but it's not the camera's fault that we don't like what we see. the onus is on us to quit looking like collective shit.
you know, as a partially deaf person, i don't appreciate being compared to those mongrels.
obviously each voter can only do so much. but trump got fewer votes than romney and barely more than mccain. the democrats shed ten million votes in eight years. this election was fantastically close. if you took clinton's margin of victory in dc, population 650k and the most democratic jurisdiction in the country, and distributed it in wi, mi, and pa, combined population 25 million, then clinton makes up the deficit /twice over/ and wins the election. this thing can down to 100k votes in three midwestern states. never let the trump supporter forget that.
for people that say this, i'd just wonder what they make of wisconsin this election. you had hillary vs trump, and trump obviously beat hillary. but in the same state, in the same election, senator russ feingold, perhaps the closest to bernie in terms of policy - a stalwart progressive with the outsider image - was also up against a traditional republican conservative wall street senator. guess what? not only did the bernie candidate lose. he lost by a bigger margin than clinton lost to trump. in wisconsin. if it was really about economic anxiety and hatred of wall street, especially in the midwest, that would not have happened. something else was going on, and i feel very strongly that it was effective fear mongering by trump. he is an outstanding demagogue, and demagogues can be extraordinarily effective if they aren't shunned by their party or exposed by the media.
you know the rural vote didnt come out more. the man got even less votes than romney its just dems just kept finding excuses not to show because obviously trump will lose. like seriously a tenth of our dems were like naw its cool he wont win i want to watch stranger things
jesus; 2 under 2! was gonna say you don't fuck around do you but you definitely fuck
if you haven't seen it i'd recommend garth marenghi's darkplace. only six episodes but it's dismally brilliant.
just remember that the majority of voters voted for hillary. millions are petitioning that the electoral college uphold the popular vote.
you know, as a mixed-race mongrel, i don't appreciate being compared to those hooligans
amazingly coincidentally enough i'm partially deaf too--right eardrum rupture and deformed inner ear. high fives. maybe i'll work on a better metaphor.
exactly. this was no ronald reagan landslide. it seems like a lot of people are confusing "shocking upset" with "overwhelming victory." it waan't.
i will suggest that a big part of hillary's problems in wisconsin were that she didn't feel it was worth her time showing up to campaign there and assumed she'd won the state.
rural vote is a minority, 15%, they can't put up numbers much unless a state is dominantly rural. that said, it's funny how dems claim to champion minorities while sitting on rural voters, who are themselves one.
friend of mine is getting ready for 5 under 2. first time around it was twins. this time around its triplets. needless to say hes gotten a vasectomy
thanks for the recommendation. its so sad that great shows don't last long, but at the same time i think their short lifespan is what makes them so good. doesn't give them time to job the shark or go overboard with the same useless jokes.
was born when my brother was 14 months old so i can happen. apparently my dad fucked.
garth marenghi is awesome and all these guys appear on each others shows it crowd mighty boosh snuff box man to man with dean learner if you like one, you suddenly have 5 shows to watch :)
my brother is 13 months to the day older than i am. i have 5 siblings, and none are separated by more than a year and a half. my poor mom. this might be part of the reason she was always emotionally, and even physically, distant.
i asked for a wet wipe and they said we don't do wet wipes, i said 'the fuck you don't do wet wipes', i'm paying two ton a head and you don't do fucking wet wipes, they said no we don't, i said 'well send out for a wet wipe'. i've got shrimp all over my hands, i stink, i need a wet wipe.
in a year the grass around him is going to be amazing.
i guess he just won the lawn competition in the neighborhood
it's amazing how many commentors dont realise this guy is on a well. lpt:. if you can't see your neighbors, you're not on city water.
the road around the house helped because it acted as a fire break.
if the company that installed those sprinklers or owned that product doesn't use this for advertising they are missing out.
i remember this episode of star trek: next generation.
"a kansas man is in the news today after being cited for owning a sprinkler system, which turns out violates local code in his zoning area. code enforcement discovered the violation after the homeowner illegally used his illegal sprinkler system to save his house from a wildfire. code enforcement officials are taking this seriously and are investigating."
am i the only one imagining the most intense battle between sprinklers and a fire trying to get in? can we get a cartoonist over here to illustrate?
last year in fort mcmurray so many people turned on their sprinklers with the same idea it killed the water pressure at the hydrants. the fire fighters had to scramble teams to go from house to house to shut them off, wasting time that they could have used to defend the perimeter.
when my jackass neighbors set off fireworks in our crowded neighborhood during the driest time of the year i always turn my sprinklers on. having a web controlled system is awesome. just pull out your phone and you get to survive the night.
i was born in the yellowstone fires of 1988 and my parents were cattle ranching at that time. my dad did this same thing to save our house when the fire got too close for comfort -- except there was no sprinkler system, so he took several of those spinning lawn sprinklers and put them up on the roof to soak the house before jumping in the car to evacuate. the house survived, but lots of other places around the area didn't. it was apparently a pretty scary time. some of their livestock burned alive -- free range cattle became trapped in the flames high in the mountains. some of them lived, but when my dad found them later on horseback, their feet and ears had been burned off in the blaze and he had to shoot them.
was it sprinklers or the the fire break from his road?
that's what i was thinking too. that is one hell of a control burn!
except for his grass...which will be mediocre. :)
i don't get it, why would the grass be amazing? wont it be non existent?
with the way that line goes around, and across the road (which looks like a cattle guard), it looks like it was probably a fence instead of a fire line. you are more of an expert than i am though.
remember that pete & pete episode with the lawn competition?
reminds me of the guy living on the destroyed planet who turned out to have murdered an entire race for killing his wife.
you think maybe he closed the windows, too? i mean, he thought to turn on the sprinklers...
i grew up with a lot of neighbors but we still were on a well. rural life, man.
did he also have back up power? how didn't the power lines burn up that power the well pump?
the opposite works too. lpt: if a flood is coming, set your yard on fire.
well that went from pretty cool to depressing as fuck. thanks.
i don't think it was very controlled :/ i get what you're saying though
idk about that... had a few fires on the hills in my area. the hill has black soot that normally has like wild grain on it (golden colored). it took a few rains to fix and grow, and the drought didn't help.
fires add nitrates, phosphates, and carbon to the soil and can revitalize old soil like a dose of natural fertilizer. some grasses actually need fires in order to seed and germinate, similar to many old-growth trees like sequoias. so the grass that grows back in from the burnt out areas will likely be lush and green. small comfort for the people who may have had a home burn down, but they'll still have a killer lawn.
bigger consequence might be this becomes a trend where everyone does it and overloads the water system and slows down firefighters refilling their trucks.
my dad in san diego got industrial firehoses and sprinklers for this purpose. they're on the roof and he's got a switch to blanket the property with torrential fake rainfall if the wildfires come again.
so what works the best? those sprays, rotators, or the ones that go back and forth?
i only remember two episodes of pete and pete. the one where younger pete befriends some clothing inspector and they have a contest to see who can eat ribs the most perfectly. and the one where he and his neighbor get the dog to piss in the yard by showing him the polaroid of his old pissing spot in their living room. yeah, memories are weird
plus that looks pretty rural so i'm assuming they are on well water. you need electricity to run a well pump. i don't think they had electricity in the middle of the fire.
the moment i saw this picture i thought there was more than sprinklers at work here. this looks exactly like a structural defence from firefighters. there are plenty of pictures of houses that have been in the path of wildfires and come out looking a lot like this one due to the work of firefighters. saying sprinklers did this is misleading and not giving credit to people that deserve it.
every year half the state of kansas burns in controlled burns. smoke from grass fires isn't the same as smoke from a house fire, or even a wood fire. there won't be any smell in the house. it will smell smoky for a week or so, but just because the wind will be blowing the ash from the fire. once the grass comes back, that smell too will disappear.
would it, though? it's just a grass fire, you aren't dealing with burning chemicals and synthetic materials that would be associated with a house fire. i can't imagine the smell lingering in the way that partially vaporized plastics and fire retardant treatments would leave behind. if your house catches fire, you will need professional treatment to salvage anything hit by smoke, because it's going to be a chemical cocktail. but campfires and fireplaces won't ruin everything around them if you're only putting dry wood on them. if you start burning plastics and painted/pressure-treated lumber you'll have problems soon enough but proper firewood shouldn't leave any lasting effects.
you think closed windows makes a house air tight? lol
you would be able to see where they were. this guy is on a well.
then you can come back to a nice dinner of steamed house.
this is my hometown, very very much not a controlled burn :(
in southern ks, where this was taken, they burn off the pasture land every couple of years to cut down on the woody growth. the grass will come back green as ireland in a few weeks (native) grass is well adapted to fire. if you let the field go too long between fires you get too much fuel load and the fire will get hot enough to burn the roots of the grasses. but the article says this family had cows so i bet the land was managed.
it really depends on how well the house was buttoned up prior to the homeowner leaving. how sealed up were the windows? were there a lot of vents? what direction and speed was the wind blowing when it burned? did the fuels around the home have a lot extractives (oils)?if he had brandguard vents it would have likely reduced the amount of smoke damage because they close up when they are exposed to heat. if he didn't, there is likely some smoke damage, but it is hard to say. i also have no idea how much vegetation was around the home prior to the fire moving through. if it was just grasses and the fire moved through quick it could potentially have minimal smoke damage. it is one of those things that is impossible to tell from this photo and you would just need to look inside the home. can't really read the tea leaves on certain things with wildfire. way too many contributing factors.
it takes dedication to win the neighborhood lawn competition.
wouldn't mind seeing that thing run bet it's badass
i hope he has a remote trigger for it so he can set it off when he's away from home if he needs to.
my dad has a massive diesel pump with professional hoses you can also hook up to eachother for this. drop the input into any waterbasin and you got an actual waterhose on par with that of a fire-truck, so much pressure and coverage it's insane. was invaluable during the fires we had over here last summer.
as i understand it the goal is to saturate the ground and vegetation before the fire arrives, not so much to actively beat back the flames. use whatever gets the most water on your roof, lawn and trees before you need to evacuate.
yeah i don't get it when christians say things like that. "he saved me but said 'fuck you' to those nosy neighbors".
!remindme 2 hours, when the picture from that link actually finishes loading
the firefighters and inspectors in this thread mentioned the lawn being in good condition was a major factor. so, the cows probably did help some.
lots of people with wells will have generators to keep the water running. you can handle a few days without electricity but add no water on top of that... no good.
for real. idk if it's fucked up to say but he's probably the first celebrity death that i was actually sad about!
smoke from a house fire is worse by orders of magnitude because of all the toxic shit houses are built from. source: i build houses.
doesn't have to be completely air tight (though a house with storm windows is generally airtight enough that you can't safely run a gas heater without opening a window or vent). just needs to prevent airflow in, and i can't think of any reason for flow in to be happening. hotter air outside means lower air pressure outside, so net flow through any small air gaps should be from inside of the house to out. how would the smoke get in?
i dont think most people will take a moment to turn on the sprinklers when the world's burning around them.
cheaper than the deductible on his homeowner's insurance i am sure.
there's been some really interesting studies done by kansas state over at the konza prairie regarding controlled burns. basically if you let it go more than 10 years it'll be gone for good and claimed by cedar trees. those fuckers are the devil.
so, should i find myself in a similar state, how would you button up a house ahead of a brushfire?
remember when napoleon had that neighborhood lawn-competition with russia?
right? would be cool to get an idea of how he did it.
"hi, i'd like to talk to you about a new testament of jesu - oh, christ!"
has he ever tested it/recorded it. i'd love to see a video.

especially pisses me off in medical situations. *"god saved little shitbilly and made the surgery go right"* no you arrogant asshole, it was the skill, dedication and hard work of the hospital staff.
really? nothing for robin williams or alan rickman?
damn bro. it even has kansas in the title. kansas: the typeover state
lets say there's a house that's about to be built - the foundation and some of the initial plumbing is done. the lumber has been delivered and is sitting in a stack in the yard. now lets say it floods, and this stack of wood ends up underwater for a week. is it ethical for the builder to still use this wood? what kind of issues could that cause? i'm asking because this exact thing happened to my neighbor, except i don't think he knows. i do because i watched his house go up. they used the wood, every board.
if you leave a gas stove on without lighting it, the gas will displace all the air in the house and stop the smoke from getting in. just be careful to dispel the gas with a lit match when you come home so you don't breathe any of it. another helpful tip: leave piles of dry leaves and brush in your yard and around the back of your house. this will distract the fire from burning your house, giving you extra time to escape.
i honestly read that as, "hope your house is on fire".
i would have liked to bring my family to help, but my wife took custody of arson.
hahaha, i do feel like a brandguard salesman at work sometimes, but the reality is that vents are a pain in the ass to replace and brandguards are exspensive. haven't checked recently, but they were going for close to $200/vent for some of the larger ones.
i wonder if it's a high pressure system or more of a low pressure drizzle
wait, "a" new testament? not the new testament? is it like the new new testament? testament 2.5?
only have pics of it, on my work computer though, not here at home i think.
i don't think christians are trying to take away from the skill and dedication of the staff, they just believe that god has his hand in everything and deserves thanks for the protections he gives when he does. if they aren't also **extremely** thankful to the people involved then they are not so much christians being assholes as asshole being 'christians'
this is correct. source: i give you guys money to do that stuff (insurance fml).
i want to upvote because i know you're joking, but i want to downvote because people might think you're serious and listen to you
i hear firefighters say not to turn on sprinklers because it will reduce the pressure they need at the hydrant. perhaps only for urban areas though..
thank you for being honest on the internet, if only everyone were like you.
but is it worth it for the one or two times in the decades you own your home that will experience a wildfire?
unfortunately mine's a low pressure system, takes forever sitting in the bathroom.
don't the mormons think the book of mormon is a new new testament
but then they're actually thanking god because he stopped killing the kid, not for saving him. there's a difference. if you stab me a few times but stop before i'm dead, i'm so not thanking you.
kansas city barbecue is a real contender for the barbecue belt, though.

can we take a moment to admire the design of this joke? it's a perfect visual version of one of tobias' faux pas.
black is actually an absence of color scientifically.
well, "worth" isn't exactly the best way to put it. the three-fifths compromise meant that a slave counted as 3/5 of a person *for the purpose of congressional representation.* the slave-owning south actually wanted them to count as a whole person, and the north wanted them to not count at all. because if slaves counted towards congressional representation, then the south would have an advantage in the house. the north argued that since slaves couldn't vote, they shouldn't count towards the congressional representation of the slaveowners. the three-fifths compromise was reached to keep both sides happy.
time! the explainer arrived exactly 24 minutes after the joke.

with all due respect, is that some sort of gag forum? all i see are a bunch of good looking people complaining about how ugly they are....is that some sort of massive troll sub? i don't get it.
depends if you are talking about colors in the light spectrum or colors in the color palette.
... but... doesn't that assume that if they vote they vote the way the south wanted them to? did the south think that black men should be able to vote and also think they could force them to vote a certain way?
i will always upvote weird al. uh, spoiler, i guess.
in all seriousness, i don't truly understand how the trends of posting photographs began, but if it's something that validates the person, even if temporarily, i just let it go through. if you look at some of the non-selfie content, there's actually some great stuff, including motivational quotes, personal stories, and overall, a bunch of strangers anonymously trying to help each other out. sometimes superficial, sometimes profound, the whole thing is quite beautiful. i'm glad some people can find a bit of comfort in letting their thoughts loose in this sub, while receiving some genuine feedback and positivity for their concerns.
scientifically too. depends on if you're performing additive or subtractive color synthesis :d
do you really call people "honey" on the internet...
can i have a compliment haha just kidding i'm a big mistake gonna divorce, hit the gym and blacken up now

same here. all tattoos are the same tattoo in my opinion.
dude, hilarious clip from one of my favorite movies! thanks for the reminder
"we bought this house on auction and should get by with painting and flip it making an easy 50grand" twenty mins later meeting with contractor: " we turned on this light switch and the back room is full of asbestos and aids. it's going to put you over your budget" fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu end of show: " all fixed still made 30 grand"
not surprising. he's the only garage, potato hanger i've ever heard of, so he can probably set his own price.
"my wife wants to live downtown in a major city in the midwest but i want to live next to the beach in a rural area, so we need a house that will satisfy us both."
man: " this could be my man cave hahahaha!" woman: "this bedroom-sized closet is big enough for *my clothes* hahahaha!"
when my wife and i were purchasing a house (a hud home that needed work), i saw a show where they were redoing a bathroom and the budget was higher than we were paying for our house.
i love the ones about couples who've been around for a bit... "we're expecting our second child, so our current 2000 square foot, four bedroom house is going to be too small and we have to get something bigger."
"with three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of seven dollars, let's see what lori jo can do! on this episode of 'you don't deserve a beach house.'" - john mulaney
i usually set my budgets extremely high like that too. that way when i spend $500 a week on german milkmaid porn instead of my budgeted $10,000, i feel as though i'm being fiscally responsible.
i like the fake ones with washed up celebs like corey feldman or barry williams (greg brady) where they're "choosing" among $5m - $10m beachfront houses.
it goes both ways though. our completely reasonable 'must haves' are: 1. 2 bathrooms 2. a yard for the dogs 3. and we would really like a fireplace well have i got the house for you! this one is a single bath apartment with a communal 5 square foot yard! it doesnt have a fireplace, but its got all brand new stainless steel appliances and is overbudget by $100,000
since my wife watches a lot of hgtv, i decided to put together a drinking game. i take a drink each time: 1.) somebody says "open concept floor plan" 2.) someone says "man cave". 3.) any part of the house is referred to a "space" instead of a room. 4.) the realtor shows a house more than $50k above the buyers "absolute max". 5.) there's a cutaway to a real estate agent typing on a computer. 6.) an obviously gay couple is referred to as "best friends". 7.) the couple do a double high five when they choose their house. 8.) a major buying/renovation decision is made to cater to a dog. 9.) safety goggles are worn in a non - dangerous situation. (such as tightening plumbing fixtures). 10.) the wife asks the husband "where will we keep your clothes?" after being shown a walk in closet. i played last night. i blacked out before the 2nd commercial break.
first shalt thou meet the realtor. then shalt thou view three houses. no more, no less. three shall be the number thou shalt view, and the number of viewings shall be three. four shalt thou not view, neither view thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. five is right out. once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then chooseth thou one of the three houses.
i hate those zillow commercials that show a 5 bedroom mini-mansion on 2 acres in downtown listing at $249,999.
or "we want an open floor plan because we love to entertain" and then deciding against a house simply because it doesn't have marble countertops. i feel like this happens in every episode of every show like that i've watched.
or, they have very little money, but they are ridiculously picky about what they want in their house. "we have $20,000. we have to have a finished basement, solar panels, 3 bathrooms, and a pool."
or there is a slight variation. i'm a part time kindergarden teacher and my husband hangs potatoes in garages for a living. we're looking for a penthouse loft downtown with a budget of 95,000$ and we will become angry when you fail to find something to our taste.
what bugs me about those fucking shows is how they always hide the mexicans. keep an eye out they do all the work but it's the dipshit hosts they show doing three strokes with a paint brush or hammering a fucking wall.
when my ex husband and i bought a house together our annual income was around $120k. the realtor told us we qualified for a $1 million loan, i told them they were insane (this was right before the housing bubble busted ).
and apparently their very first priorities when they look a house are parties and guests: "oh i love this garden! perfect for barbeques!" "the house is too small. where do we gonna put our friends when they come to visit?" "look at this kitchen. we can make dinner with all our friends!"
wont somebody please think of tarek and christina??
what always gets me are the massive houses people can buy for 200-300k. where i live that wouldn't even get you a 1br condo.
i just saw a real estate show where a woman and her husband were looking for a new house. they had a toddler. they're both hippies and first they toured a $75k tiny house, which was out of their budget. then they looked at an old streamline rv, but that was too much as well. they ended up picking a yurt with no bathroom.
and the roll of credits include every diy store, kitchen appliance supplier, bathroom fitter...
i hate professional flippers.. they get the house before they get listed.. all i want is simple house with small garage.. :(
i tried to hang my own garage potato once. once. always hire a professional.
i don't like this paint color. this isn't the house for us.
ends up purchasing a loft in st louis and an island in maine with a cottage on it. both middle school teachers.
i hate the term man cave with the fire of a thousand suns, and i couldn't tell you why.
because they've already closed on a house before filming begins, and they just have them walk through random houses plus the one they bought. (sorry for breaking the illusion)
all i do is watch these shows and scream at the tv like a raging lunatic...it's like i'm watching football on sundays, but instead it's hgtv, and wife has a worried look on her face
that $500k of north us money. down south you get a mansion for this.
my sister is a fan of these shows and met a host of one of them one time. she was asking him questions and this one came up. they are actually real estate agents but they just have a show. the people in the show have already bought a house or maybe even the very house they're looking at in the show, so it's all pretend and just recreated. sometimes they'll lie about the locations of the house too, like if the couple has young kids and wants to be close to a school and playground for example but the house they're looking at in the show is no where close to any school. they do this for a couple reasons. one, the house they're looking for in that specific area may not be available, and two a tv show wouldn't be interesting if they just said "well you can't have that so choose something different". sometimes it may be in the same metropolitan area but a different city completely. a legitimate show about buying houses would be quite boring so they spice it up.
the real bullshit part of these shows: they travel across town, tour the house, then ask the price. "wow that's not what i expected." who bothers to go looking at a house, if they don't know the price *first?*
what really bugs me off is when they set a 500k budget max and the agent shows them 510k houses.
what annoys me more is when they're redoing a bathroom or kitchen and their budgets are completely off-base. a full kitchen? that's $10k. redo a bath? $5k. buuuuulll. fucking. shit. maybe for materials. that stupid show with the orange chick and that dude with the giant ears does it all the damn time.
i have a friend who paid more for his kitchen *counter* than i did for my house.
i lived in a 2600 sqft townhouse for 2 years with 5 other people (no couples) and we still couldn't use all the space. whole rooms sat empty. when i meet people who insist they need 3,000+ sqft for three people or else "they just won't fit", i'm wondering "what the fucking fuck do you do in your house?!?!" now that i've have added 2 people to my 998 sqft apt (1 bedroom, 1 bath, + den) and we haven't killed each other yet, i'm thinking i might eventually be able to do that tiny house thing eventually.
possibly the best standup comedian around right now. his writing is impeccable.
i'm a simple man, i see a john mulaney quote i upvote if you haven't, watch new in town then watch comeback kid on netflix
ah german milkmaid porn i hear that can be expensive, they only trouble is there are so many. which ones though? which ones specifically do you use?
that show where vanilla ice remodels houses is so damn weird.
my wife and i just bought a house, and on day one told the real estate agent we did not want an open floor plan. i told the agent that i only wanted to look at 3 houses and we would decide on one of them over a commercial break.
or the broker who knows your budget is only $150,000, but really wants to show you the perfect house that's *slightly over budget* at $350,000
what gets me are the people that buy a small 2 bedroom house for $900k. where i live you can get a nice 5k sq/ft house for $350k
i'm friends with an owner featured on *bar rescue*. at the end, the owner was very dissatisfied with the job done. things got a bit heated and ugly and as a result there was a huge public backlash. people were raging about how ungrateful the owner was for all the stuff the show gave them; to the level of phoned in death threats for months afterwards. truth: the show didn't give them *anything*. the show got free stuff from companies in exchange for the product placement. and some of the stuff involved, like customer operated automatic beer dispensers, wasn't even legal to operate in that county. y'all are watching great big commercials that are occasionally interrupted by commercial breaks.
tell me about it. my wife and i are looking for a place and we've lost out to cash buyers on almost all the houses we've put offers on. one place was a bit dated but in our budget. the sellers accepted a cash offer that was$15,000 below ours. three months later the house appeared on the market for $150,000 more... and they totally ripped out all the period charm when they did their cheap ass flip! can you tell we're bitter?!
that one outlet cover is a bit askew, lets try another city
look at this brand new kitchen with all white appliances. i prefer off-white, let's tear it out and spend another $40,000.
this house doesn't have high end stainless steel appliances. this isn't the house for us.
"this is an on-fire garbage can.... could be a nursery..."
maybe i'm sick, but a big reason i watch these shows is to see reality crush these peoples' dreams. also: why is atlanta so cheap? i feel like a very smart dog could figure out a way to afford a sprawling mansion there.
look, just be happy that your wife even lets you live in the house you bought.
yes, which means that the production company just walked them through a much better property knowing that the couple is already committed elsewhere. it's deliciously evil.
my world just collapsed all around me. what is real? what is?
my wife will be shocked! next thing you'll tell me the renovation actually takes *longer* than they say on tv.
its not that i don't like these "girly" shows like this or say yes to the dress, its that my so hates the way in which i like them. "hahaha look at those idiots!" is sometimes not the correct reaction to a gorgeous wedding dress that happens to cost 30k.
wait. so something on tv is misleading the viewers for ratings? inconceivable.
what bugs me is when the couple has a higher budget, say 500k or higher, and the show tries to say that they'll have a tough time finding anything in their midwest/rust belt city. yes, half a million dollars is perfectly adequate to find a house in cleveland.
i don't think they include labor costs since the craftsmen usually work for the show. plus in every show i have watched they start taking something apart and discover they need to fix something else so the budget for the redo drops even lower.
no guys i'm watching this show right now, he does it himself. don't you see that single shot in every episode where he lays exactly 1 tile in the shower with the stupid oversized soap dish thing.
do you have a 5k house or do they have a 100k countertop?
i painted my composite countertop with chalkboard paint and sealed it with matte finish epoxy. used to look like cheap plastic, now it looks like expensive slate, only for about $60 in materials and 2 days of labor.
this is an american thing. there are certainly places in canada with insane houses, but i've never had space pushed on me until house shopping in the states. we literally could not find a house smaller than 2000 sq ft. it's just us and animals. my old apartment was 1200 and that was more than enough for us. mostly, it's just way too much house to maintain and clean.
love the guy. i usually have have no issues with swearing or dick and pussy jokes (my own level of discourse is down in the gutter), but having seen his two specials with relatively very little profanity, i have a whole new outlook on standup. he was actually funny through wit, not just shock factor. props.
the continuity and flow of his stories are incredible. he sets them up and knocks them down with callbacks from like 45 minutes earlier in the routine, perfectly.
comeback kid was so great. all his stuff is, but sometimes you follow a comedian for long enough and you can tell they hit a point where they're just out of material or they aren't feeling it any more. it made me really happy to see him with arguably his strongest performance yet. my wife & i didn't even have time to compose ourselves between jokes. it was that "no not another one, i still can't breathe from the last one" begging-for-mercy kind of laughter that is so rare & fleeting in adult life.
i kinda liked that one where adam corolla was doing contractor work. he actually was a contractor before he got into radio, and back when he was doing loveline, he used to love busting out the contractor jargon when the topic came up.
well did you go with the one that was slightly over budget, the one that gave you a longer commute, or the one that ended up having an open floor plan after all?
on the flipside, i've seen brokers do that to give a reality check to picky couples. the couple will complain about everything, so the broker shows them a house that has exactly what they want, and then the price tag on their desires.
i had this discussion with my nephew. i live in amsterdam and he lives in a remote part of nl (oost groningen). i have a small 1 bedroom apartment, he has a big 4 bedroom house with a large garden, attic, garage, etc. both cost approx 300k. he was laughing but i said: i live near 1500 restaurants, 50 cinemas, 20 theaters, 2000 bars and what not. you live near 1 supermarket. he says, yeah, but where do you spend your saturday nights. i said: on the couch, but at least i have a choice.
the places in the us that have 5k sqft homes for 350k or less don't have a job market for me that would get me the 350k to afford it. ( i work in it, but really like rural areas... so i am kinda sol)
these shows were the greatest advancement in marketing history imagine being a fly on the wall in that pitch meeting "i believe people will watch a 30 minute commercial that we can sell adspace on - and we won't have to pay the actors or build sets"
i don't like the chips ahoy in the cabinet, let's try another dimension.
i saw one show where an "eco-conscious" couple wanted a kitchen made from sustainable materials. they tore the existing kitchen out to to do it. stupid cunts.
it happens cause on all those shows the guest couple has picked out the house before they even film the episode (you can verify this on google) so sometimes they need to use bullshit reasons to disqualify other houses
real estate agents always look like your mom, and they have this kind of fun mom energy
well, time to ruin the illusion. they've already picked a house before the taping starts so you aren't seeing any reality crushing anyone's dreams because these people get what they want.
the sprawl. you can live 'in atlanta' and be anywhere in a 30 square mile area. also the traffic is just awful.
my dad is a real estate investor in atlanta. he basically explains it as the housing market came back here in an interesting way. basically homes are still cheap, but they are steadily rising in price every year. our market never rushed back like other cities. it also just really depends on the area. some are especially cheap because of the neighborhoods having trouble. at least i think that's how he explains it. trying me best to paraphrase his words.
fighting for her client! wearing sexy mini-skirts and being self-reliant!
yes but it also means the prices on those other houses might be complete lies since they aren't buying them anyway. hell, they may not even be for sale.
yep. flip or flop. must have mortgage or home paid for to even be on the show. so...
never. completely gutting and refinishing a house usually take 30-60 minutes. the trick is doing most of the work during the commercials.
there are threads about people who have been on extreme makeover. i don't think anyone on the show ever responded but neibours to those houses or people in those towns did. it's crazy how much is pretend.
i would say "can't we just take a vacation for a month instead of buying that dress?"
can confirm. step-brother and sister-in-law were on one of the shows. they had to pay for their own appliances and the show paid for everything else. they got around $45k worth of labor, counters, and other shit free.
this is correct, labor costs are not included. items for the home are purchased that while they might look good on tv, are not the best quality. source: was on an episode of designed to sell.
i just dont know where we are going to get this extra thousand dollars for repairs on our 800,000 house
yea all those shows have a template/layout. every episode they find something "unexpected". they show their face in shock then cut to commercial for suspense leaving the viewer wondering "i wonder what it is!"
hah yes every time with the shower built-ins...or when she's in pristine yoga gear and acts like she's laying sod or something...
it was christina who was sending inappropriate text messages to their former contractor, not the husband.
don't you have that reversed? he found out she was banging a contractor first?
he started dating her after he had to hire her to watch his kids after separating. he fired her after they started dating but have since broken up. she was dating their old colleague. very sad story, they've gotten through pregnancy issues and his cancer but according to the people magazine interview he wasn't loving the fame and the way he was portrayed on the show with his wife making all the modeling decisions and showing him to be the stereotypical dumb guy who doesn't listen but things end up working out.
weird. it seems as though he's lucky to get her. he flew too close to the sun with those ears of his
in between those two - but in the lower reaches ;-)
i agree. while i do like guys like bill burr and louis ck, i find their negativity exhausting sometimes, it's funny but depressing. john mulaney is a refreshing change. it's also why i like mitch hedberg just simple funny things to distract us from all the other chaos out there.
he still is a contractor. while he has a mini media empire, a line of alcoholic beverages, and acting/comedy he also still buys/refurbs/flips higher end homes. thats how he actually affords all of his race car shit.
that's why i love watching the tiny house hunting shows. most of the episodes involve the buyer complaining that the house is too small, and the broker explaining to them exactly what "tiny house" means.
you could make it 3000 restaurants, 100 cinemas, 4000 bars etc. and i'd still rather live in the big house in the country.
i honestly couldn't stand a city, i live in the suburbs and can throw a rock and it'll land outside city limits, but i'd much prefer having zero of those things around me. to each their own though, some people are the city type.
a lot of it came out of the 2007 wga strike. they didn't have any writers, so they pushed the reality format and it happened to work fantastically. since then, lowered tv ratings across the board thanks to the internet meant that the format was here to stay. but the idea is hardly new. price is right is a straight up unapologetic hour long commercial.
this single dead ant from 57 years ago is really annoying, let's go back in time.
happens a lot with old buildings. eco-conscious groups, organizations, people tear down an old building and create a ton of waste to make an eco friendly building instead of just modifying the existing structure which would be more eco-friendly
no people are really like this. why they want you to "stage" your house just right. it's more likely to sell then say it being clean and empty. as people are to stupid to imagine what it could look like. same with paint they don't like etc.
*why would you take this away from me???* what's next, are you going to tell me william hung knows he's not a good singer?
yes that's how property brothers' is run. the home owners already have purchased the "fixer upper" so the whole looking at multiple homes and deciding and waiting to hear back if they got the house is all fake for the show.
it sounds a lot easier to walk around a random house that's for sale, than a random house that isn't for sale though..
i could vacation really hard for far longer than a month with a $30k budget.
property brothers do renos in canada. your reno budget has to be $150k on top of your purchase price to even be considered for the show. the labour is still free of course.
i don't know if you've done any home improvement projects yourself, but there's never been a scenario where everything went according to plan. i always encounter something unexpected that requires more time, more materials, a new tool, or all three.
how do you know all this juicy gossip and how can i stay abreast of the petty behind-the-scenes action as well?
you people know way too much about the lives of meaningless people.
the worst part is that her designs aren't even good half the time. because they're flipping houses quick, they're all cookie-cutter designs with shitty granite countertop and tile floors. she only has one style and it gets old quick. i appreciate the shows where they at least attempt to make each project unique.
but i be done seen 'bout ev'rything when i see a elephant fly
where the fuck do you live where you found a sub $100,000 house?
man... follow the link in that sidebar to r/faptoberfest ... jimminy cricket...
dude. the tiny house drinking game: "this is really small." "i can't do a compost toilet." "this is really small." "our teenager is so happy to sleep in a loft without a door." --pan to pissed off teenager.
my wife is obsessed with the tiny houses. she wants us to get one when we retire and i'm just like "no, i like having space." then she's all "it's just stuff! we don't need all of this stuff." i like my stuff.
11-year-old me home from school on a sick day says don't you talk shit about the price is right.
the gravity in this house is slightly irritating, let's try the moon.
to further demolish the illusion - they aren't brothers. in fact, there's only one of them and it's all done through cgi and split screens.
i've lived for an entire year on half of that. fuck vacation s, that's a down payment on a house.
i feel like the property brothers look like someone took harry connick jr and split his attractiveness across two people.
my friend's wife watches that show. they actually have a separate show with a different name. when i come over and she is watching the other show i'm like "oh, you're watching property brothers" and her response is " technically they are not property brothers right now" ...for some reason i found that hilarious. now when i come over i'm like " are you watching property bros? or technically not property bros? "
did you pause dramatically for three minutes without revealing what it was?
my beau and i practically lived part time in the local home depot when we were redoing the paint and floors in our new home. then again when we redid the chimney. then again when we started the deck. if you don't have to go back to the hardware store at least once, you probably fucked it up.
i'm a huge fan of the show and had no idea any of this was happening. all i knew of what that "episode" tarek had when he ran off into the woods with a gun after they'd had an argument.
i clicked on an article once about them on my cellphone, and now android shows me updates about them all the time.
also, the contractor - carlos - has a sister who was found to have an illegal side business growing and selling psychedelic dandelions using hungarian street kids as her drug mules. carlos also has a fake-tanning obsession.
i was honestly thinking of adding almost that exact sentence. i still watch the *hell* out of price is right when i'm out sick. it's a commercial, but that don't mean i don't love it.
i sense a disturbance in the force. let's try a galaxy far far away.
the cgi was maxing the budget so drew just walks around with a mirror.
or all of a new house if you want to live in a van down by the river.
they have property brothers as well as brother vs brother, buying and selling, and property brothers at home in addition to off topic with the scott brothers not a lot to do during dialysis but watch hgtv and animal planet.
i know i pause for an extended period because i just opened the ceiling and the are 45 dead rats.
i was redoing a house last year and we found an old mortar behind one of the walls. we called the police and they had to bring in the army and shut down the street for a couple hours while they dealt with it. it was pretty dramatic!
you forgot, it's my 9am getting ready to get busy beer, the beer while i work beer, the i'm waiting for the paint to dry beer, the it's 3pm... what was i doing again beer, and of course the it's fucking 5pm fucking fuck o'clock and i've been busting my ass all day while my wife is at her fucking friend's house not fucking helping beer.
i did some googling and best i can tell the sources that mention the nanny and contractor action refer to it as being after the split-up and supposedly he fired the nanny before banging her. take that fwiw
carlos's half brother manuel, who used to work for el chapo, was arrested under the influence of said pyscadelic dandelions. it was during his 12 year prison stint that he was able to write 2 different cooking books, "huevos para la cena" and "minute meals for the man on the move". he has since became a best seller on amazon and has worked with martha stewart on numerous occasions.
but is it a commercial if you're not going to buy any of that shit? i mean 11 year old me gave no shits about that blender or that washer dryer set. i suspect the only people who were watching a commercial were the homemakers. the rest of us probably couldn't name a brand that was on the show 30 mins later.
these aren't the droids we're looking for. let's boldly go where no one has gone before.
how i imagine that going: "my wife's a dirty whore. wanna bang?" "no. i work for you." "you're fired. wanna bang now?" "sure. you're like, on the telly." (the nanny is british in my version)
doesn't necessarily matter if *you* buy nikes because you know they are "good". someone else buys them partially because they want to wear something that passers by will know is good. brand awareness has value even when you make non-customers aware.
the granite counter tops are wonderful, but let's try that black hole over there.
i could see daft punk using this for an album cover.
only the center of the picture is loading for me but what i can see looks great!
this photo was taken in toronto, on canada. gabriel puyana is the photographer. @natgeoyourshot posted it on their instagram, too.
i'd love to chill on one of those decks with a beer and watch the sunset. bliss.
am i the only one mildly infuriated that the balconies aren't symmetrical?
sometimes there's things that are just *so good* they're almost supernatural. this is one of them. other than the building on the right looking like it curves to the right every-so-slightly towards the top.
photo =/= video. vertical photos are perfectly fine.
fucking op!!! /r/quityourbullshit /r/karmacourt
i mean, technically... a sunrise over here, is a sunset over there. lol
now this is human nature "some things are so perfect in supernatural....like this thing..... except it's not really perfect look here is a minor almost indetectable defect.
i think there's an app that can create those for you from any picture. i forget the name of it though.
i think you mean =/= and not /=/. in other words, /=/=/==/=
thanks for taking the time to share. i will spotify this later! shanks
nice one thanks for the new artist to listen to. great sounds!
hmm i've never heard of him. he doesn't seem to be well known in the scene.
thank you for making fun of me in a good way and getting me to laugh. you're absolutely right, too.
that's what i'm here for. jokes and jokes. what a great fucking photo though eh?
"i believe in birdcare as a right, not a privilege" -birdie sanders
holy fuck really cashin in this time eh /u/gallowboob?
r/politics would probably vote for this bird instead of hilary clinton
this is a juvenile (born this spring) barn swallow, for those who are interested.
side note, that bird is a fledgling and still requires care from its parents which can likely be found in the surrounding area. it probably won't be able to fly yet but will hop around on the ground. so it's best to leave it with its parents so that they can continue to feed it. just in case you didn't know!
what the hell? when i first saw this earlier today, it had 11k+ upvotes. now it only has 8k?
i just imagine op spending most the day attempting to catch a bird, then glue feathers to it's head. all the while muttering "karma, karma, karma".
too bad there's a hen in the barn who's already paid off all the cows, sheep, and pigs (i.e., the supperdelegates) to vote for her. little birdie doesn't stand a chance.
"everyone gets breadcrumbs." which is not too far off from bernie's real slogan.
mac: uhhhhh, hey guys? what the hell is dee doing? charlie: i don't know. is this some kind of prank? dennis: it's certainly not a prank, charlie. dee's not smart enough to orchestrate anything like... dee: i'm stealing frank's identity dickwads. yeah. that's right. i'm gonna waltz my happy ass into philadelphia national and withdraw his whooole nest egg. then i'm gonna... mac: nest egg! ha! dee you look like a bird that hangs out around a crack den! dennis: haha! yeah dee... in that costume you look like what would happen if bernie sanders had sex with a bird, then that child fell into a chemical dump. charlie: yeah! hahahaha dee you're so dumb! so dumb! this is never going to work. dee: yes it is you buttholes! ... frank (busts into paddy's pub wildly wielding revolver): i just got a word message on my iphone! which one of you is trying to steal my identity! **cut to black** *sweet dee steals frank's identity*
"we live in the wealthiest bird-country of the history of the world, but not many birds know that. you know why? because they are waking up before the sun rises in order to get the worms, inscets, and other tasty food before their fellow bird can. every day they have to worry about getting enough food for their chicks. most birds do not perceive that we live in a wealthy bird country because almost all of the bird seed is going to the top 1%. the top 1% is able to wake up at any time, fly to an automatic bird seed dispenser and give the bird seed to their family. there is something profoundly wrong with our bird country and it is up to us to fix it." -birdie sanders
"there's something very wrong in this country when one percent of the flock gets ninety percent of the birdseed."
yeah the fact of the matter is birdlaw in this country is not governed by reason
i feel like trump cat would be more interested in blocking dog doors.
serious question, how is he always on the front page?
since bernie lost it's been /r/hilaryclintonsemails
politics aside, that's such an adorable reaction and i want him to be my grandfather.
check op's post history and decide if that's really him holding the bird lol
this might be one of those childhood folklore stories i was always told growing up but per my childhood i was told if you touch a baby bird it's parents won't tend to it anymore and it will die.
yes, op tracked down the exact bird to loathe in delicious karma.
or, maybe they just like the hen better and know the little disheveled hair birdie just showed up to use their barn for his own political gain.
i think public education should be free! anyone should be able to get a degree in bird law if they work hard enough.
he posts a massive amount of content and deletes the stuff that don't get a lot of upvotes in a couple of mins. he probably also cheats with bots and scripts.
as a foreigner looking in on american politics, i will tell you who you should vote for and what your country should be doing. -- /r/politics
/r/politics has basically turned into a crowd-supported clinton investigation fan fiction.
i don't know if i'd want giant flaming meteor as a president. i do think he'd make a great running mate for bender and his platform of kill all humans.
i love his smile. i've watched a couple interviews with him and i was shocked to hear him cussing with this cool young black barber guy. i was shocked bernie had a relaxed mode.
you would think the people of the "free" world could trust a man who has such a genuine reaction to the beauty and peace of life.
just wait until the bird primaries are over, you just wait.
you mean to tell me /u/gallowboob isn't the most interesting man in the world?
yup, 100% false. in fact, i have had multiple wildlife biology jobs which entailed taking baby birds out of nests to band them, take measurements, blood samples, etc. we put them back in the nest afterward and the parents continue to feed and care for them 100% of the time. depending on what kind of data you're collecting it can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes to process the nestlings, but i'd imagine abandonment could be a possibility if you had them for some inordinate amount of time. the whole "birds abandon babies with human scent" is bull, though. with the exception of some vultures, most birds can't smell very well anyway. still, it's best to leave baby birds alone because your leaving scent/drawing attention to the nest could attract predators, and baby birds require a fuckton of food to stay alive, so you don't want to disturb them without a good reason.
i will support migration reforms that keep flocks together, not separate them
is this circle jerk supposed to be bad? it sounds good to me. a country where you succeed through merit as opposed to money sound good to me.
but this is imgur, so technically he is off reddit. are you off pudding? because you're off putting.
in my experience, whenever i see people being extremely hyperbolic and exaggerated about trump on there (he'll literally destroy the country, he's hitler, etc) about 7/10 times that person ends up being canadian. it's really weird.
honestly as a american you got to realize our votes have a profound effect on the rest of the world.
i decided to visit r/politics after hillary gained enough delegates for the nomination. every post on the entire front page was about her emails. every single one.
holy mother of god! and i thought that place was bad back when i unsubed.
i wonder what hillary would do if a bird landed near her. i think she's probably melt the bird with her alien ray-gun eyeballs.
we're only down 8% in the latest bird poll. we can do it.
it's amazing how using the analogy of birds makes it starkly obvious how ridiculous it is some people get exponentially more than others for the same thing.
just wow. might be the strangest sub i've ever seen
according to the new pew poll, canadians are like second most likely to see trump as favorable in the western world, second to hungary. i may be remembering the place wrong, but it was 14% compared to 3% for greece, etc. it was up there.
that does not matter at all. what americans should be voting for is whats best for america, not whats best for other countries.
r/politics front page right now almost is completely clinton/lynch/dnc threads, only 2 of them are not.
the thing about conspiracies is that they actually do exist sometimes. shame that the word has an instant negative connotation for it's user.
bernie sanders is all my grandfathers on this blessed day :)
demand a campaign contribution and sell it a gun.
a bird doesn't count his eggs before they hatch. it might look like 1900 eggs but who knows, might be 3400 birds in there
the top 1% of the earliest birds get 60% of the worms! we gotta do something!
if we act out american politics using bird puppets, we will get to the truth!
oh damn it's mr. gb. are you a single poster or are there many people using your account?
do people actually talk about politics in r/politics or do they just talk crap about the candidate that the majority of them don't like most of the time?
just so unfortunate. she wasn't even particularly old. rough to hear this.
i'm glad she had the chance to make force awakens and see how many people appreciated the part that she played in that franchise.
the oscars' "in memoriam" is now probably aa long as a star wars movie.
i got to ask her, mark hamill, and harrison ford a question at san diego comic con a couple of years back, and you could just tell there was so much love between all of them. this is such a devastating loss for so many reasons but at least she's at peace now. thank you for all the wonderful memories carrie.
god this is awful. to go through all the shit she went through and come out the other side with a lot of recent personal and professional success. and now to die so young. rip.
once i heard about the situation they reported on the plane, i told my parents about it (both in the medical field), and they both said the chances are, she'll either die or be left with some pretty serious medical conditions for the rest of her life. perhaps it was better for her to go (presumably) peacefully instead. thank you for the amazing performances carrie, you will be missed.
how devastated her mother, debbie reynolds, must be. so terrible when a parent has to bury their child.
man, while this is depressing, and falls right in line with the whole "fuck 2016" vibe, let's focus on the positive: * only female star of arguably the most lucrative movie trilogy of all time * paved the way for viable female movie heroines to be somebody other than arm candy for the male star * publicly faced her demons and helped give visibility to mental health issues * helped bring down the empire the force is with carrie, and carrie is with the force.
wow what a turn. from the initial reports, to being in stable condition, to passing away. sucks man.
when i was a young boy, princess leia convinced me that girls could be just as cool as boys. everyone was a person, not to be divided by their gender. rip. i guess it is time to rewatch the original trilogy again.
the [r1 film](#s "end of rogue one with cgi leia smiling to the screen") is going to have even more poignancy now. :( goddamn its been a shit year for national treasures passing away
so what does this mean for the new movies? surely she was going to be in them?
damn it. i didn't know how it'd turn out but i really hope she pulled through. i'm not sure if this sounds insensitive but i wonder how this will affect the plans for the new trilogy. i'm guessing she would have been in viii and ix.
well they said that ep8 wouldnt have as much hype / fanfare as ep7. remind me to never cross the disney marketing dept.
the space vehicles in star wars all seem to have artificial gravity, though. hell, they even had (apparently normal) gravity inside that asteroid in empire strikes back.
he just wanted to see her without a bra, because the science definitely doesn't back him up on that one. at all. the body and gravity do not even remotely work that way ha
parents should never have to see their children die, it's tragic.
man i listened to her fresh air interview a few weeks ago, and goodness, i know she's ~~only~~ **primarily** known for one role. but what an interesting life to be raised almost completely by hollywood/the film industry and have such intriguing stories to tell. really a shame to see this... **edit**: i'm not trying to be dismissive of her career here. so i reworded my initial statement.
cocaine and alcohol abuse will do that to you unfortunately. it was so fun to see her during all the press for force awakens. such an icon... :(
i'm not ready. i met her this summer and she was an absolute delight. this feels personal and i was not ready.
lauren bacall called her "the most extraordinary feminine brain i've ever come across." she was a smart cookie.
she'll be in episode 8 fully too they are done filming
agreed. she got to enjoy a real resurgence these past couple of years.
unfortunate that she also got to see how many people didn't appreciate her part simply because of her age or appearance, even after she worked hard for years to change her lifestyle. she seemed to have taken it in stride, though. carrie had some seriously thick skin.
she also most likely had a role in episode 8, its a shame she wont get to see the result of her work though
they usually still trim them and don't include everyone. they'll list everyone on their website or something, but the segment in the program often has some omissions for time.
they need to do them as the star wars screen scroll
i don't doubt you're right but i've always heard that harrison and carrie hated eachother after the ot because their affair ended poorly.
sad, but very true. humans just can't come back from a heart attack that severe.
being paralysed or brain dead is more terrifying to me than death.
oh the bright (i guess) side, dying of a sudden heart attack usually means minimal/very brief suffering. at least it wasn't a lifelong battle with cancer or something. my parents often say: "that's that way to go." (trying to ignore the cocaine issue)
for those who don't know, debbie reynolds is part of our history too. she was the lead opposite gene kelly in singing in the rain, charlotte in the charlotte's web movie (1973), grace's mom in will and grace, and the grandmother in halloweentown.
i really hope that staring one last time in star wars as leia brought her a lot of happiness. it seemed like them getting together again was great for all of the cast.
thank you for not using the lucas updated version of this
unfortunately "stable" did not mean "not braindead from oxygen deprivation". her brain probably went too long without oxygen during the initial response on the flight.
it's kind of weird that the last time i saw her "alive", it was in cgi.
filming wrapped for the next one, she has credits listed in it on imdb. they'll have time to figure out how they want to handle it going forward.
any role she has in episode viii i would assume has already been filmed; the release of it will be bittersweet for that reason though. episode ix, they could write her out or cgi her like in rogue one... but that seems a little too soon.
"have you been drinking wine all day?" "oh liz its heart healthy." "all day??" "oh come on liz, its the nineties!"
space worm generates gravity to aid in catching it's prey. you can explain anything really.
well it's not like she died of natural causes. years and years of severe alcohol/drug abuse does irreparable damage to your body.
my mom is 67, it's cliche but we all need to appreciate every day we see. 60 is not that old. i just hope her family is alright.
her real career in hollywood was as a writer, a "script doctor"; someone that is hired to spice up dialog, edit unnecessary scenes before they are shot, etc.
damn, i was looking forward to the release of ep viii, now its gonna be kinda bittersweet : /
it's strange to hear about all these deaths. they're mostly just celebrities and cultural icons to everyone, but there's always those people, obviously exempting loved ones, that have been influenced a tremendous amount by them.
makes you wonder how they will handle star wars episode 9 depending on what she has done in episode 8
it warms my heart that carrie fisher died a healthy, (hopefully) happy older person reliving the best years of her life. it may not have been her "prime", but it was a close second. sometimes, at 30, it feels like the best is behind me, and its all downhill from here. carrie showed us that self improvement is always possible.
makes me sad how many people judged her so harshly. i did not enjoy the force awakens, but i thought she was fantastic. for a 60 year old woman, she looked great. i'd like to see how these critics of her body look like themselves 30 years later.
pretty sure they are going to rewrite a part of the plot of episode 8 as well. similar to what happened to paul walker in furious 7. wouldnt be surprised if a digital likeness thing is used again to give her character some closure
they finished filming a while ago, so she'll be in it.
they don't seem to understand that we don't care how long it is, we just want to see everyone that we knew and liked.
funny story, actually. initially i was going to ask harrison ford what made him change his mind in terms of playing han solo (because at one point before force awakens he said he'd never play solo again). but then chris hardwick asks him that exact question 30 seconds before i'm supposed to speak and i must have turned white as a ghost because i had no idea what i was going to say. luckily i pulled a question out of my ass at the last second asking how the force awakens was thematically similar and different to the ot.
that's possible, but thirty years is a long time to hold a grudge.
ot? never mind, just got it. original trilogy for those wondering.
yeah, this is tragic, but there's some solace to be found there. same with bowie, though their arcs weren't identical.
very interesting to hear your take on it as a radiologist. my step-dad and his friend (who was at our house at the time) are both family physicians, and my mom is a nurse (geriatric right now, but she's done hospice, oncology, etc). they didn't really explain to me what they meant in detail, but i was willing to take it on face value. it's nice to know the specifics though.
hey, i'm the glorified button pusher that injects tc99m dtpa (here, at least). i've only performed 3, all on younger patients, all positive =/
my grandpas had 3 by 25 and had 6 by 80s i think he was able to get almost immediate attention each time
definitely. most of us have known someone who's battled cancer or other serious illnesses (wow...that's sad to write), and i'd bet almost everyone would rather see a loved one die of a heart attack or something fast than a slow, deteriorating death like with cancer. as jack nicholson's character said in the bucket list, "somewhere, some lucky guy is having a heart-attack."
and god damnit, if any of you haven't seen singin' in the rain, just go do it. right now. it's one of the greatest musicals of all time. it'll help with the crippling sadness.
while rocking the iconic space babe bikini, no less.
a doctor friend of a friend said something along the lines of - you have about 3 minutes, from there damage is irreversible. reports had her at at least 10 minutes without oxygen.
i imagine they'll write something like "in memory of carrie fisher" during the opening credits. i'm gonna cry like a bitch.
they could use some cut footage to make a hologram transmission. short and sweet.
depending on if leia survives ep 8 or if fisher even finished filming, the cgi debate sparked by rogue one is about to become huge i think.
i know how this feels. my grandmother's youngest, my aunt, passed away last thanksgiving. she got diagnosed with brain cancer 10 years prior and was told she had a few months at the most. she somehow beat it into remission but a year prior to her passing, it came back.
was she still drinking? it looked like she was on 8 out of 10 cats recently but i may be wrong.
her mother, debbie reynolds, is still alive and well at 84. i can't imagine the complete heartbreak of having to bury your child.
yes! i believe that was mentioned in her fresh air interview, or maybe i read it on /r/movies?
or when harry met sally, she was basically the main supporting actress.
very bittersweet. it's probably going to end with in memory of carrie fisher.
presuming she's shot her stuff and she makes the cut, i think we're lucky to have that to look forward to.
in the eu she was a force user, idk if they are going to tie that in
do you know many 60 year olds? 60 is young. 60 is the age where you imagine you'll have at least 20 more years of healthy living. generally, 60 year olds are basically as mentally and physically capable of enjoying life as anyone. my 60 year old mom walks 4 miles every morning, plays tennis or golf every week. meets up with her friends. goes on vacations. loves time with her family... 60 isn't old. it's a tragically young age to die.
if it lifts your spirits any, three years ago, at age 45, i had an existential crisis and decided to make a conscious effort to become more fit. nothing insane, just eating better, drinking less, and doing a lot of walking and cycling. as a result, i felt much better at 47 than i did at 27, and i saw my abs last year for the first time in my life. it was a pretty good feeling.
she worked out and lost a lot of weight (as did mark hamil) and she had drug issues she was dealing with. but there were still some people commenting negatively about her looks.
yeah i thought that shit about how she looked was stupid. she was fucking 60, what do you think she's supposed to look like? i think everyone had a skewed idea because most actresses get a bunch of work done and carrie didn't look like she had
i remember everybody being all bitchy about how awful she looked in that movie, but i thought she looked really great. better than harrison ford, even.
i'm actually thinking they would have to shuffle around a whole lot of stuff for ix as well. for some reason i always thought that they would go the redemption route for kylo ren through leia and not luke or rey. either way, regardless of star wars, this is extremely sad. she was way too young.
it wasn't all bad, was it? no. some of it was pretty good.
not to diminish fisher's death in this regard, but bowie knew he was going out and left us something on purpose. his last months were painful, and he still made his art priority. heart attacks don't allow for a whole lot of time and planning though. it was unfortunate coincidence fisher went out shortly after the force awakens. i think most of us would prefer she had enough time for her star to fade again some before the end.
yep. my pleasure. i did love to teach and honestly, a lot of what i do is really, really fascinating, but not widely taught or publicized except to radiologists themselves. a lot of clinicians (i.e. physicians who see patients in person for a living) don't even know what the hell it is we do or what we can do. so often i'll get calls from other doctors with a problem about a patient and my job as consultant is to help them pick the best type of exam to help answer their question.
i think that's the key. carrie was unfortunate enough to be on a plane when it happened so her chances were reduced greatly. hopefully she went peacefully.
3 heart attacks by 25?!!? holy shit what? he must have a heart condition right?
i'm sure they mean those rare types of unresponsiveness where you can actually hear those around you and register what's being said. kinda like the book 'johnny got his gun', or the metallica 'one' video.
i'm going to echo this and add to watch it even if you don't like musicals. i am really not a big fan of musicals in general, particularly the old showtune type such as sitr, but goddamn it's a great movie. i think what makes it so good is that the non-musical parts are really strong; the dialogue is witty and the plot in general is hilarious.
lots of people criticize the "space bikini" as sexist, but i see that as the point. jabba was a gangster and a pig (in more ways than one). of course, he would dress a female captive/slave like that. for her part, leia played along, biding her time until she could rise up and strangle jabba with the very chains he used to bind her. leia was the epitome of a strong woman.
what a gift she has given us for all future and current generations.
that would be tasteful, but confusing as to why she isn't present probably. i think the best bet would be writing her out, honestly. it's been said the newer films will focus less on the original people than even the force awakens did, anyway.
it seems insincere, but for people that use them all the time it probably comes across as more genuine.
drinking yes, but it's the cocaine that will fuck you up really bad in the long run. it turns your heart into a though hard ball.
she basically said that she couldn't remember the star wars years because of her rampant drug use at the time.
i might be wrong but weren't both her parents apart of the hollywood elite? i imagine being exposed to that at a young age might lead one down the seedy side of the movie industry.
it's going to be so hard to watch it now knowing its her last film.
i can't see any way how it wouldn't be dedicated to her. what a legacy she laid down for the films, and there'll be tears when her last scene in ep viii appears on screen...
i'm really hoping if she wasn't killed in viii they do an off screen death for before ix. i'm ok with the cgi used in rogue one for cushing and a younger her, but this would seem too soon.
it's going to feel weird watching her on screen knowing that she's dead
this is the first thing i've seen today about the news that's actually made me genuinely laugh. a lot of dumb jokes but this is freaking funny.
she's definitely force sensitive by sensing han with kylo
my mums 56 and looks like she might need a hip replacement. she can't walk without pain. 20 years of that does not seem like an exciting prospect. i think it really depends on your overall health by that time.
what i meant in my first post by "healthy" is that she had given up her worse habits (afaik), and she was living a more grounded and peaceful life. i don't really know though, that is just the impression i got from seeing her latest interviews.
kylo kills his mom too. he is irredeemable. he's going to make the empire great again.
this makes me sad, because i recently lost the woman i loved, a woman who was 36 with 3 kids, to a heroin overdose after some serious legal issues arose, left her terrified and simply wanting an escape. she was at a 'friend's house' who had heroin that she found and got into, relapsed after 6 years clean... had a xanax earlier around lunch, but sniffing the heroin put her to sleep. her friends found her od'd and dragged her into the bedroom, and left her there on her back, incoherent and unresponsive for 5 hours in the dark. autopsy found the rest of her body was perfectly in health. she bit off her tongue, however and clawed the side of her face open trying to breathe. my guess is that she would have died in panic, but can you tell me if suffixation like this would have been quick?
i had heard the plane she was on had some doctors and nurses on it; apparently she only got to hospital alive due to them.
this exactly. the story is actually really funny. there's a ton of musicals especially from the 1930s and 1940s that have amazing singing and dancing (pretty much all of the fred and ginger movies) but the stories are really weak. like i've seen every one of their movies and i honestly couldn't tell you the plots other than "guy meets girl, falls in love, girl rejects guy, guy woos girl with dancing and singing, girl falls for guy, they end up together." but everyone's performance in singin' is just fantastic.
hamill is a prolific user of hashtags. it's probably just default to him.
drinking is just as bad in different ways. i just don't want anyone to have the impression that it won't kill you by 60, because it will.
that's probably what did it. ride til you die bb4l
her dad was singer, movie star, eddie fisher who left home to marry liz taylor
debbie reynolds was the lead in singin' in the rain.. she was fantastic in that movie. i know her costar didn't think she was as good a dancer as she should have been for that role, but she was still great.
is most of it filmed or will it be similar to fast and furious 7 where it was cgi?
i don't know, ep 9 is slated for 2019 i think, and paul walker in furious 7 wasn't considered too soon
oh man, i am so, so sorry. another victim to this horrendous epidemic. well, i can tell you that the initial stages of anoxia (lack of oxygen) are terrifying as you are programmed to panic. it takes a few minutes. but, the best solace i can give you is that it ends with sense of profound euphoria and gentle peace. in other words, there's no suffering. again, sorry for your loss.
holy shit, that's incredibly horrifying. i'm really sorry to hear that. did anything happen to her "friends"?
not doctors or nurses, but apparently there was an emt on the plane that could perform cpr until they managed to land the aircraft.
episode 8 finished filming in july, but we have no clue if she was going to be a big part of 9 which hasn't started filming yet.
f7 was actively in-production when walker died, and his un-filmed scenes were done with the blessing and involvement of his family - there's *plenty* of time to re-write ep 9.
which a doctor replied to people saying there should be more doctors on planes by saying an emt is just as good if not better than a doctor in that situation. because doctors tend to need to use labs, get tests, have people to help them where emts are trained to dealing with emergencies with limited supplies and on the spot.
somewhere in a board room, people are deciding whether they should cgi her into episode 9.
don't forget anton yelchin in star trek. for me, his death is the most tragic out of all these. the man had no health or substance abuse problems, he wasn't even speeding, he just died in a freak car accident in his own driveway.
honestly with how well he acted, i didn't really think about heath when i watched the movie...
what you really want is a paramedic. source: am paramedic.
they might even have to re-edit or reshoot parts of episode 8 depending on how they set up her role. what if ep 8 ends with luke, leia, rey, and finn all together on the millennium falcon? or if she is set up to be a big factor at all? will they want to use a lot of heavy cgi to give her a prominent ep 9 role, or just re-write some ep 8 stuff so that she can make a cameo cgi appearance (or no appearance at all) in ep 9?
unfortunately, this is probably (a large part of) why they put tarkin in rogue one, not because he absolutely needed to be in it, but to test the waters, both technically and ethically, for keeping characters alive after the actors have passed away.
i will agree. there are really good studies that show there are only three types of doctors that you want in these situations. 1. trauma/critical care 2. ed 3. the one that knows this information and backs off when ems arrives. the reason is that these are the only doctors that understand that clock is ticking and it is time to go to the ed. all other doctors slow down transit time. on a plan you would get bls at best. i mean let's be real tsa is not going to let me take 1/2 the supplies i need for in hospital arrests: epi, hco3, ca, mag, amio vials, an io kit (i can place a cvc in 1/2 the time it would take for a piv so no i am not placing a piv, so let's go with the io kit for space saving in the over head... either way tsa would never allow that drill), et tube, and a laryngoscope.. and then where do i even get an o2 tank and tubing to bag... oh yeah... and my ambu bag. but u/waltjrimmer is correct. statistically speaking you want an emt.
am i the only thinking about how he's distracting the people behind him?
"get off your knees ref! you're blowing the game!"
congrats to norfolk senior high for winning class a state basketball in nebraska. first time since 1987.
too bad it means that someone missed a call from the ref, not that the ref missed a call
wow i think this is norfolk high school. small town in nebraska. happened to turn on the state finals game and they're playing. nebraska pride?
i don't know a thing about sports. can someone please explain this joke to me?
i'd like to take this opportunity to say that i think the referees in all major sports do a fantastic job. it's amazing they can call a game so well in this age of 20 camera angles, hostile fans, and endlessly repeated review.
serious question. what does the person behind this kind of sign see?! like how is it fair to them? i've never been to a sporting event so it seems like a dick move to whoever is behind you...?
"poor college kids" then how do they afford these huge smartphones?!
this is the best. looking at the sign, then looking at the dude's actual face, is awesome
if he's like most of the people at the games i've been to, the sign wasn't held up long enough for it to be a major nuisance. its usually when the camera broadcasts the crowd on the jumbotron.
you clearly have never been to a college game in the students section.
i made a huge sign one day and was all excited to bring it to the game. brought it, but never held it up because once i got there i realized it was kind of weird, and then i thought about the people behind me getting pissed they couldn't see, and on top of that they couldnt see because of a weird sign, and i was overwhelmed by the feeling of inevitable shame. then the girl i was with that i really liked thought i was weird that i wouldn't hold up the sign i was so excited about and she never spoke to me again and to this day i really wish i would have had sex with her at least once because she was really hot and was so nice to me.
no. on reddit, someone will always find a way to shit on the fun.
also, why would they make and bring that giant sign just because on the off chance that the ref makes a bad call. that can't happen that often.
if you look it looks like everybody is in uniform. not sure if it's a cheer section or what, but i'd wager they're people there to support the game. and, as others have said, i'm sure it's only held up temporarily. but yes, fuck people that feel the need to hold up signs in front of you the entire fucking game.
thats why i dont get it! glad im not the only one. i was sitting here staring at it trying to figure out who the ref is calling like wtf.
i'm from norfolk and just left the game. saw the title of this post and thought "holy shit could it be?". never thought my hometown would be on the front page of reddit.
they probably don't get paid well enough. refs have literally been mobbed and executed by fans. it's really awful the way fans act over something that has zero bearing on the majority of people's lives.
no, refs have historically been deprived from the benefits of education, including literacy classes. it is only now that society is starting to understand the struggle of the referees as they try to find their place in this word filled world.
also the sign makes it look like the guy in the grey behind him has a huge head. it's a trifecta.
are they in on it together? or did that neckbeard have a marker and paper with him?
fedex couldnt open high res pics for posters? so they expect to use low res pics to be blown up 2000%? that is really strange to me. gotta invest in the tech if you are gonna charge an arm and a leg :p
no one cares really if you only put up the sign after a play and keep it up for ten seconds at most.
it's not just shitting on the fun, it's the shitting on anything when you can tell it comes from absolutely no experience in the situation.
it's a funny sign but it's huge only to display text that nobody can read without a telephoto lens, i'd be a bit annoyed getting my view blocked by it.
yeah pretty nutty. i'm from lincoln. the odds of something from lincoln making it big on reddit are slim, let alone norfolk???
i think all major sports have more than 1 ref. football (real football, aka soccer for murricans) has like 5 or 6 refs
when i was a kid, i always wanted to be a referee. when i told my parents, they said it wouldn't be possible, because it's a handicap you're born with, and i wasn't born with it.
we need to make the right call when it comes to ref rights
jj is redickulous. have you seen his stats? doing the clippers proud.
looks like the students from one team raided the other student section to hold up a sign. the neck beard fought back.
nah, their photos were *insanely* high-res. the image for the poster i printed out was about 71 mb, and they had no problems opening it. once i even printed out a picture of the eiffel tower that was, like, 40 megapixels. i don't even know how hs students had access to such high-end cameras, but whatever.
it's not a tech limitation, it's policy. fedex will not open any graphic file bigger than 10mp because they believe anything made by an expensive camera to be the work product of a professional photographer and therefore under copyright. of course, these days plenty of consumer camera can take 10-12mp photos, but fedex would much rather lose your business than get sued for letting people reproduce copyrighted photos.
ever heard of vector graphics? high res art is *typically* done with vectors
argh its not in second person! it's "show me what you got" and "i like what you got"
okay... then you've never been to a soccer game, from what i've seen it can be very distracting.
yea but they would have saw it then... f that noise...
with the background on the phone a picture of the refs kid/wife/family
brazil, 2013. a ref made a disputed call, and ultimately ejected a player from the game. the player began to fight with the ref, and the ref pulled out a small knife and repeatedly stabbed the player, who died en route to the hospital. friends, family, and fans of the player rushed the field, tied up the ref, and stoned him to death and quartered his body. they then beheaded him and put his head on a spike in the field. also, in argentina last year, a ref was shot and killed by a player he ejected from the game.
i believe he's referring to an incident involving soccer refs quite a while back. i would recommend not looking further into it. you won't like what you see.
yep. one i know of happened in brazil after a soccer game. fans took the ref and beheaded him.
no it doesn't? it has one ref, two linesman and a fourth who's main role is managing subs.
when i was a kid, when i was a little boy, i always wanted to be a referee. i wanted to be a basketball referee more than anything in the world. i wore striped shirts and i roamed the backyard, i officiated local pick up games, i blew my whistle and i gave techs. everybody knew me and was afraid of me. and one day my dad said, "bobby, you are 17. it's time to throw childish things aside," and i said, "okay, pop." but he didn't really say that, he said, "stop being a fucking referee and get a job."
holy shit - that's my roommate holding up that sign. he spent about 2 weeks making that damn thing. i honestly thought it was going to be one of the many things he started and never finished but there it is. now i'm going to hear about his 15 minutes of fame for the next 3 goddamn years. we've actually been roommates since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
what's it like breaking up 3v2s at the blue line for a living?
as a tar heel fan, tyler hansbrough was better in college. however jj is doing his dam thing in the nba
i wonder how different it would have been with a healthy chang. nebraskan form the island.
the redhead doesn't think it is the best student sign.
it's like if you went to an arsenal game and alongside the regular 'wenger out' signs there was a massive phone that had "wenger's phone" and "calling... it quits"
soccer fans are certifiably insane. my sister wouldn't let me go to a match in argentina because peeing on the foreigners was the least of our worries
i saw the first 5 words, the length of the paragraph, and looked at the end for "1996" or "announcer's table".
sounds like a movie where rob schneider can be the ref's whistle.
damnit... got me. no matter how many times i remind myself to read the username.
actually, with the pants, they're more black than white.
no you dummy, footlocker only hires prison inmates
benchwarmers but rob schneider is every character.
so *that's* why they only accept payment in the form of sacks of money with a big dollar sign on them.
well it's where people browse when they are at work so...yes?
it all began when they stole our oil and hid it under their country . . . .
an *excellent* question. let's bring our troops home until we figure it out.
this pic made me sad. just the mere thought of what's happening in other countries like this is enough to send chills down my spine. i can't even begin to imagine how my life would be like if i were in her place and at that same age. would i still be able to smile and pose for a picture like that?
is this pic you op? this couldn't have been more perfect. i was in a coffee shop today and overheard two customers talking (very loudly actually) that our military would support the muslim ban. i proceeded to tell them that i served for almost a decade in the navy and no, vets would not be for this. and your picture made my day. that is for doing the hard work friend, and continuing the fight
to be fair, what did soldiers think they would be doing when sent to a foreign country armed to the teeth? pretty sure many signed up after 9/11 if not just to go to another country and fight.
to shoot terrorists, knock down a few regimes de-stabilise the region then invite our new friends who certainly wont hate us over back home. totally worth it.
we lost the "war on terror" you know how you can tell? ask yourself who changed after 9-11, them or us.
why you were sent to her country is partially why they decided to stop allowing iraqis.
newsflash: countries don't go to war in order to be friends.
holy fuck.... i thought reddit was already at full retard leading up to the election.... had no idea that level hadn't even been reached until the last few days.
it's for 90 days. the nation's selected don't represent even 25% of muslims. obama had selected the nation's. this was done to iraq for 6 months in 2015. that said, no one in the left cared about anyone in the middle east when obama was drone striking civilians in these very nations now blocked.
"oil? who said anything about oil? bitch you cookin?"
seems like a great idea. although... didn't some president say that he was going to do that like eight years ago?
he did just make the pentagon figure out a plan to get rid of isis within the month. (the plan not the action) i have a feeling this is going to be a similar course of action as desert storm. i feel like a lot of us are going to have a quick trip to syria/iran/iraq/turkey.
yes, please. i'm tired of working 12s bombing people i have no idea why. thanks, obama.
dude is savage, yet leveled, in his responses to some of those people. wish him well.
a lot of the kids loved us, probably because we threw them candy every day. they also stole shit. they also reported back to neerdowells. i always thought when i got there it'd be like that scene in indiana jones and the temple of doom with all the kids in the mine begging for help. what i saw a lot of was people doing normal family shit with their kids, picking them up from school or teaching them how to do things like bake for the fanily, etc. it amazed me, that despite all the recent events, kids would still run up to you asking for chocolate and run away with a big grin when you complied. they just bounce right back. then again, i patrolled some of the areas outside of the baghdad airport so maybe it was a nicer area or something. what was my point i forget?
reminds me of a piece john ~~stewart~~ oliver did some time ago about this kid talking about how they hated clear sunny days because it meant the us drones that were bombing where they lived could see the ground and start dropping bombs again. don't remember exactly what he said at the end of it but it was something to the effect of "how fucked up is it that we as a country have managed to make children terrified of a fucking sunny day.".
because you have something a lot of others don't. empathy
vets should speak up or speak louder. many conservatives seem to have the mistaken belief that all vets are trump supporters and blindly agree with anything he says.
i, for one, have been greatly concerned for some of the people who i worked with in afghanistan. many of them are trying to come to the us and start a new life because they are not safe in afghanistan after working as interpreters for the us military.
i joined in '95. after 9/11 the majority coming in from boot camp had the initial drive from those attacks..after a year most had whispers of, " what are we doing here?" after awhile most connected the dots to oil, at least the ones that were not ideologically blind.
you missed a few of the main objectives. for dick cheney and co to make billions. for the neo-cons to be able to have a mythical good vs evil battle where the us white knights the world. to give the conservative government an excuse to enact austerity/spending cuts "for the war effort." to give excuse for enacting tighter surveillance. to test out psychological methods of population control.... all sorts of 'nice' reasons.
upvoted you until i read the end of your comment. banning their people will only help create the narrative that we hate them. it will help isis grow.
there were popular uprisings across the arab world. tunisia, egypt, syria, libya etc. nato forces in libya were mostly providing air support. it was the libyan people who overthrew gaddafi and killed him.
they kinda did in iraq though. idea was to topple saddam and install a democratic government that would be friendly towards the us.
he was not in support of the war, if you called hannity you would know. someone please get hannity here to confirm this.
yeah, one did. then, he discovered drones and went a little crazy.
because no one asked the pentagon what to do before /ss
thank a few more than just obama, we could probably start with bush.
some guy called him a fake marine and told him he deserved to come back in a box with a folded flag on top. what a fucking piece of shit keyboard warrior loser
it's amazing how they just carry on. a local terp i spoke to towards the end of the conflict told me he was worried because even though he could speak four languages and could probably get a job in a safe country he would not abandon afghanistan. i didn't get his name because it was just a chat over a smoke but i hope he's alright.
wow, it's almost like we're humans before our national identity. who could have guessed that?
gotta love the extremes i get to see on reddit. human things like this and then in another thread people casually talking about exterminating the people of iraq. reddit's amazing.
i cried and laughed a bit when you said that they stole shit. i think your point is that kids will continue being kids wherever they are and whatever situation they may be in. it's amazing how a piece of chocolate is enough to bounce them right back up when all around them are these weapons that, in the wrong hands, could end their innocent lives. i salute everyone who protect these people and give them a little bit of hope that someday everyone can have their piece of candy in peace.
there's a documentary called "drone" on netflix done by npr which really explores this in depth, iirc it had footage of the kids talking about this. it really morphed my stance on the use of drones, to be entirely honest. i'm not totally anti-drone now, but i'm far more attentive to the issues that they create.
that is the one thing powerful elites and lawpushers don't have. if they are to be good at their job, they can't have empathy.
because we've been oversaturated by trump doom and gloom since early 2016 and people would rather comedically deflect than continuously grapple with reality. not saying i condone that, just that that's my best guess. it's not even like it's a relevant joke, it's just random nonsense that people would rather see than engaging with an authentic emotional response to this post. (he is right about fruit salad though; cantelope is not supposed to carry the squad.)
don't you dare single out the italian eateries. plenty of other restaurants bring you their house salad and its nothing but some iceberg lettuce, a gram of shredded carrot, a little wedge of tomato, and a slice of cucumber. don't forget that it's served on a tiny plate so you can't even mix your dressing around without half of it ending up on the damn table. that's not a salad, that's something you paint to practice still life colors.
are they not $5 anymore? i don't eat at subway, i thought that jingle was their main deal.
sure, we went there for oil. tell me again how our oil prices *didn't* skyrocket until we started fracking.
honestly, i think it was even simpler than that. bush just wanted to kill his dad's enemy.
as someone who didn't vote for w., obama or trump, i bring this up to highlight people's partisan hypocrisy, not to excuse trump or obama or w. people defend their team against the same stuff they attack the other team for. how about we decide what we actually approve and disapprove of and remain consistent regardless of party? american politics has turned into a team sport and it hurts everyone that people treat it like that.
it happens for every new president. the same thing happened after obama became president in '08. the continued complaining about bush. it happens every year and wont change.
i think it's because a lot of these supposed anti-war critics were silent during the bloody obama years. and so it's good to keep that disengenousness in mind.
because its the topic of discussion. why *wouldn't* we compare the actions of presidents on a related topic? obama made a lot of promises that he didn't fulfill, this being one of them.
drones are a great way to fight terrorists and create new ones all at the same time without risking us lives. it's an interventionists wet dream, figuratively have cake and eat it too
you can go back to carter, maybe even before that.
just build a wall around the states. untill this mess is sorted out we dont know who we can trust.
thank you for sharing that. my eyes started producing water for some strange reason but it was a beautiful read
don't have a save button on mobile app so commenting thanks for sharing this
those are the best people. it's a shame that the richest and brightest leave their country's to basically never have a chance of improving. this is my primary issue with the american/mexican border, the people that want a better life leave and the country stays exactly the same. it's a pressure relief valve for mexican politicians to not get overthrown. america may take in a tiny drop in the bucket for us from these countries but they are losing their best people that could enact changes to help everyone.
isn't the point of his anecdote that they still functioned like normal kids despite all the warfare on their own metaphorical front yards, not because of their nationality?
when i was overseas we handed out cricket kits for kids. one day *we* were given something back as trade from the kids. it was course a small bag of nacho cheese doritos. made your heart melt.
i don't really understand why people don't like drones. it's still a human operator, and it could just as easily be a strike aircraft with a pilot sitting in it dropping bombs. the drones aren't machines which decide for themselves whether or not to kill specific humans. true enough a drone can circle an area for far longer than a conventional strike aircraft due to more efficient fuel expenditure, and no pilot to experience fatigue, but that just seems like a natural evolution of warfare. i'd love to have a different perspective on the matter if you're willing though.
we're just inventing ways to kill people at a further distance, further dehumanizing the act of murder. as odd as it sounds we'd all be better off with medieval warfare, less casualties overall.
well, if you want to bring the cia into it, they've been ruining middle eastern countries since the cold war. anything to get back at the soviets. even if it meant those countries will eventually turn around and focus on america.
that's not trump doom and gloom, that's all of reddit and much of social media in reaction to any issue. the sharp one-liner is often the thing most upvoted, most retweeted and most liked. it's also completely ineffectual, as is pretty much all commentary, including this comment i'm writing. in fact you could say it's even counter-productive because it provides a place for people to bitch and moan - a sort of release valve that takes off the pressure which would otherwise build to critical mass and action in enough numbers to effectuate change.
fuck no. those bitches are fucking $7 in cali. it's fucked.
a $6 steak and cheese is the best you'll get and that's only for a limited time. if they made their sub of the day a sub that's actually tasty and relatively lower calorie like on mondays it wouldn't be so bad.
$5 was only ever a promotional deal...and even when they briny it back, the number or sandwiches that are included to now just the super simple turkey, ham, veggie, etc.
reagan, aka the gop messiah, invited the taliban into the white house and compared them to our founding fathers.
i'm in the same boat. i'm a registered democrat, but i vote strictly for the person i think will do what they campaign for, and i agree with. i was first eligible to vote in 1992. i knew bill clinton was a corporatist and not a democrat so i voted third party. i knew kerry would just be a dnc stooge. and i knew obama wouldnt rock the boat to actually deliver on his campaign promises. i'm glad i didn't vote for any of them. bernie on the other hand, i believed. he would've shaken up the establishment and delivered or attempted to deliver on his campaign promises. i did vote for him. now i'm torn, because while i'm against everything trump stands for, i'm happy to see a politician be true to their word. the people who vote party first or only vote for someone who can "win" , are the reason trump won in the first place. stop voting for party and vote for policies and actions.
if they don't like obama doing it, then why are they fine with trump doing it? you'd think "obama did it" would mean it's something they don't approve of.
not to be that guy but this situation entails no literal cake
yea too bad they kill hundreds of innocent civillians as well. but hey at least the interventionists like it
i feel like trumps plan to have somebody else make the plan was a good plan.
nixon. fucking kissinger. if there is a hell, he deserves the worst part of it.
i mean i've had people thank me for my service then later tell me quote "i should suck it up" when i talk politics. i usually ask them which of the 2 wars i went to that they sucked it up in.
you mean apart from a lack of compassion and empathy? these are the same people that believe that if you can't afford health care it's your fault.
after all, me, you, and the soil probably came from the same supernova.
"when a child gives you a gift, even if it is a rock they just picked up, exude gratitude. it may be the only thing they have to give, and they have chosen to give it to you" dean jackson
that's actually the feeling of your arteries clogging from all the nacho cheese dorito dust.
perhaps the problem is the emotional distance it creates. when you say "american drones killed x civilians", it softens the effect of what has actually happened: and american pilot bombed x civilians. i'm in favor of drones existing, but vehemently against the manner in which they have been used in practice. i tend to be left-leaning, but i loathe obama for his expansion of the drone program and the heavy civilian casualties it has produced. it's no less irresponsible than using a stick of dynamite to hammer in a nail. perhaps it can get the job done, but you've caused enough collateral damage as to nullify any benefit.
personally i don't like the lack of oversight and the rules of engagement. any "fighting age" male killed, and anyone simply unidentified, is considered an enemy combatant killed. obama at the beginning of his presidency used to personally read the files and decide on drone strikes, but later gave the cia more independence on the matter.
idk, i remember reading that drone pilots have the same rate of ptsd as other pilots and that they had to watch their targets for a lot longer to make sure they fit the criteria which also fucked with their heads.
i'm sure you wouldn't agree if you had to be the one fighting
oh please. like jimmy "put on a sweater" carter was a saint.
i wouldn't say he wants to be finished with it. he wants us to take all of their oil. which means we have to be there until it runs out. which means ~100 years, last i checked. i think that's the exact opposite of wanting to bring the troops home.
by that logic they should give trump fifty nobel peace prizes.
much as i dislike trump, that actually *is* a good plan
i'm not american, but it really bothers me how much the internet (and people in general? i don't really speak to many us citizens on the regular) seem to think that the current situation is a recent problem. later leaders have certainly made it worse, but it's a snowball that started rolling quite some time ago.
people tend to look at obama and bush like they started all this... nah, nixon/kissinger are definitely further up the list than those other two could ever dream of being. you can find them just above reagan.
i see this sentiment of reddit all the time but no one ever explains why
nobody wants to see nixon fucking kissinger do they?!
you know what irritates me about that? those types of people want lower healthcare costs because they're sick of "paying for everyone else." they fail to grasp the concept of disabled people, like those with severe birth defects or injury, that need those assistance programs. i got into an 'facebook arguement' with a guy that said a person with severe ms just needed to "get a better/other job" just so he could pay less for insurance. this sense of individualism/nationalism is just shamefully selfish. i dont mind paying a little bit more for health insurance, if it means a low-income cancer patient has a chance at treatment. i also dont mind paying for social programs like ebt (food stamps) ... if it means a low-income child gets a daily meal. are those programs abused? absolutely! however, removing the programs entirely is more disgusting than those few who abuse it.
the same people that probably also can't afford it.
tbf, willy wonka did help the world government against a foreign threat in the great glass elevator.
it's why i never cared for patriotism, it's just a form of made up tribalism, an us vs. them mentality, that on the surface seems to be for uniting but really it was designed for dividing.
he said he wanted to bring them home because people like to hear that. then he said we should take their oil because, sadly, some people like to hear that as well. the problem with just saying whatever people want to hear is sometimes you are saying diametrically opposed things that could never coexist. and thus, you get trump.
it was also a you're the first black president award. the hope was that his election would help to usher in greater racial harmony.
we have been fucking around in the world for a long ass time. it is time to stop.
jfk authorized the 1963 coup in iraq, which led to the iraqi baath party gaining party, which led to saddam hussein taking power and which eventually led to where we are now.
this is your mistake, getting into a facebook discussion with someone. i made this same mistake today, the outcome is always bad. rip /u/elektrakon
this. especially the end. there will always be people who try to exploit whatever system you put in place. they will be the minority. the more you try to 'fix' the system to ensure they have no access to it, the more you limit access for those who need the help. i'm so sick of our country being so afraid someone might be getting something for free that they focus on that rather than the good that can be done.
exactly, its not the bleeding heart liberal elite that's going to suffer from the aca repeal.
ah yes, vermicious knids. the carnivorous race of amorphous, shape-shifting aliens allegedly waiting in dark space. we have dismissed that claim.
one thing i realized growing up in the states and living in europe now is how fucking weird the gung-ho patriotism in the u.s. was
as a brit, i feel some ancestral guilt as it was us that did the butcher's job on israel and palestine.
if we're dipping into the abrahamic pantheon, i believe the canonical source of the divide was when abraham knocked up his slave because he thought he might not get one out of sarah, and when he finally *did*, sent poor little ishmael off.
man if only suliman the magnificent helped protect the ottoman empire more, then we wouldn't be here.
there was recently a bill in tennessee that wanted to remove "junk food" from the items that could be purchased with food stamps. it boggled my mind that somebody thought that needed to be a thing! their reasoning was to "combat obesity" but i dont think they ever stopped to think about the consequences of such a law. what? low income families dont deserve cookies because theyre poor? ... fine! let them buy a weeks worth of fruit for the price of some cookies. food stamps already limit the amount of non-processed food that these people can purchase, because of price. do they really need to feel more worthless and aloenated? (no!) i am sure, if given the option, low income people would fix fresh, healthy meals, but it is impossible on a food stamp budget for every meal to be healthy.
everyone will suffer. people forget to realize what else the aca did. with removing pre-existing conditions and being able to be on your parents health insurance until 26
don't worry mother! your daughter murica is doing you proud!
ok absolutely fair point and you are the best kind of correct. i was kinda saying us humans have always been lookin ta kill other humans, for whatever reason we can come up with. she has straight hair. his teeth are too far apart. you know, totally valid reasons to wipe them and everyone like them off the face of the planet.
oh yes definitely, basic human compassion is completely communist after all. i bet those red bleeders can't even give one example of universal health care working!
do you ever disguise yourself and just walk around incognito?
if you could give 19 year old bill gates some advice, what would it be?
i am sure you have traveled to all types of famous places. do you have a favorite vacation spot?
what kind of technological advancement do you wish to see in your lifetime?
hi bill, what's the biggest 1st world problem you get?
what do you think is the most pressing issue that we could feasibly solve in the next ten years?
if you could create a new ip and business with elon musk, what would you make happen?
why do you think our healthcare systems have such a hard time leveraging the revolutionary changes in scalability that we've seen in software? amazon is able to predict what we want, often before we realize we want it, but healthcare systems struggle to even schedule routine appointments and labs. having worked on both the healthcare and tech sides, i think people underestimate just how big the differences are between the two fields, but i have a hard time saying who needs to bend more for us to reach a happy compromise. also, any idea on what we as concerned patients and family members can help to encourage this compromise? i just feel like we're so close to using technology to improve efficiency and thus increase accessibility to care. thanks for your time!
mr gates! any thoughts on the current state of the u.s.?
hi bill, i'm going to become a father this summer. do you have any advice you wouldn't mind sharing, from one dad to a dad-to-be? thanks!
hi bill. how often do you get to cook a meal for yourself?
hey bill, have you considered running for president in 2020?
mr. gates, what's your biggest flaw? i get asked this all the time in job interviews and it seems like a trap of a question.
mr. gates, how do you feel about president trump and his views on global climate change?
i sometimes wear a hat. for example when i did college tours with my son i wanted the focus to be totally on him. a lot less people recognize me when i have a hat on or else they realize i am trying to be incognito. mostly when people do recognize me they are super nice so i don't feel it is a burden to be noticed most of the time.
i would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as i thought it was back then. i would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. i wasn't very good socially back then but i am not sure there is advice that would fix that - maybe i had to be awkward and just grow up....
warren buffett has always said the measure is whether the people close to you are happy and love you. it is also nice to feel like you made a difference - inventing something or raising kids or helping people in need.
this is a great question. i felt sure that allowing anyone to publish information and making it easy to find would enhance democracy and the overall quality of political debate. however the partitioning you talk about which started on cable tv and might be even stronger in the digital world is a concern. we all need to think about how to avoid this problem. it would seem strange to have to force people to look at ideas they disagree with so that probably isn't the solution. we don't want to get to where american politics partitions people into isolated groups. i am interested in anyones suggestion on how we avoid this.
australia is particularly nice. it is summer there when it is winter here so going there in december and january is especially nice. i spent thanksgiving there last year. i have gotten to travel to a lot of great places like the amazon in brazil which i recommend.
i will be 76 at that time. hopefully a grandfather. the foundation with its partners will have eradicated a number of diseases and health in poor countries will be a lot better - specifically instead of 5% of children under 5 dying it should be at 2.5% which is still a lot. i hope i can still type fast enough to do reddit sessions without someone transcribing for me.
the big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do. there is a lot of work going on in this field - google, microsoft, facebook, academia,... right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test. another whole area is vaccines. we need a vaccine for hiv, malaria and tb and i hope we have them in the next 10-15 years.
i would say education is the key problem. if you can solve that then it helps with a lot of things. maybe i didn't understand the question - maybe it supposed to be some idiosyncratic thing that bothers me....
please mr. gates. i owe my entire college ambitions and career choice in the history field because i spent long, long hours as a kid playing aoeii until odd hours of the night.
a lot of people feel a sense of isolation. i still wonder if digital tools can help people find opportunities to get together with others - not tinder but more like adults who want to mentor kids or hang out with each other. it is great that kids go off and pursue opportunities but when you get communities where the economy is weak and a lot of young people have left then something should be done to help.
we need clean, reliable cheap energy - which we don't have. it is too bad the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. the economist had a good piece on this this week. so we need some invention - perhaps miracle batteries or super safe nuclear or making sun into gasoline directly.
no. perhaps a small chair - a stool. i do exercise and ski but my main sport is tennis which doesn't involve jumping. some people jump over the net but that isn't part of the sport.
a contribution to rotary to help end polio is a gift i would appreciate. also any great book you have read and found interesting.
the one question i really wanted answered and of course it doesn't...
the main "copying" that went on relative to steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that xerox parc did in creating graphical interface - it wasn't just them but they did the best work. steve hired bob belville, i hired charles simonyi. we didn't violate any ip rights xerox had but their work showed the way that led to the mac and windows.
he famously once said "it's more like he broke into xerox's house to steal the tv only to find that steve was there before him." or something along those lines.
if bill gates spent his own time to pack that box and prepare your gifts just know that your gifts are worth their value and about $5 million in labour costs lol.
i just went on a trip with my 17 year old son to see 6 colleges. he is a junior in high school and trying to figure out where he should go. trips like that have been a great way to spend time together. he reads even more about politics than i do so i let him pick books for me to read. melinda is very creative about helping me find chances to spend time with the kids. even just driving them to school is a great time to talk to them.
this seems a lot more important than any dumb question i might have thought up for him.
i am not sure if steam here means the gaming platform or adding arts to science, technology, engineering and math. i have always been a big stem fan but i have nothing against either steam.
i know he's said in the past that he has no interest in being president, but we *desperately* need a science minded president. if we're going to start electing businessmen to the presidency again, i'd at least like one like bill gates, who is forward thinking, pragmatic, and best of all, compassionate. i'd be honored to vote for the man, personally.
not bill gates but... one of my professors told me the best way to answer this question. look through the job announcement and find something on it that you don't know how to do. when the interviewer asks you what your weakness is you can say "i've never worked with x program but i've worked with y program and am a fast learner" or something similar. that way they know you've read through the announcement and they're aware that you might not have the exact training they want, but you have something similar and can be easily trained how they want. it's a way to say something you're bad at but in a good way
there are so many great tv shows now i can't keep up. i thought someone might ask specifically about silicon valley which i love. i can relate to richard. silicon valley captures a lot of how crazy it is to start a new company and the dynamics of success. all the employees of pied piper remind me of people i have known. i love this is us, the crown, the knick, homeland, downton abbey, ...
i can't believe that actually works. we all made fun of marvel movies for using this as a disguise but here we are.
in that case my life is an abject failure. thanks for telling it like it is, mr. gates!
i feel like gates and buffet are like obama-biden level bros. mutual admiration and respect for miles.
you're going to have to change the culture i think. right now people think of politics like a football team and that is dangerous.
now more than ever perhaps we should focus on teaching kids in schools about critical thinking and history. and often people confuse critical thinking with "making sure they think like i do." but perhaps by focusing on presenting differing viewpoints and fairly analysing them, especially in the context of history, they might get a mindset which is a bit more open and understanding of others' viewpoints. you can't control what they do on facebook but school will always be there.
i've seen some comment threads claim he doesn't do enough charity because he still has nearly a hundred billions so clearly he must not be throwing enough piles of cash at the problems! people are idiots
"first world problems" are things the fortunate people in the first world complain about. for instance, while a third world problem might be that your water is contaminated with malaria, so you go to another pond and find out that one is contaminated with another virus, in the first world, it would be something like you have an iphone and go to a friend's house, and the only chargers they have are android chargers. so in your case, it might be that your ferrari is out of gas, so you have to take the lambo to the store that day ;)
hey, you seem like a guy that can get things done. can you give gaben a ring and get us half-life 3?
let me guess, now you hate the game? my love turned to hatred for the movie dead poet's society six months after i graduated with an english degree and remained unemployed.
nah, that's the third in a slate of new expansions that were being worked on prior to his response. people were asking about another aoe game altogether.
it's pretty sad that in an age of technology and communications such as ours that one of our biggest and growing issues is the disconnect we have with each other.
#stooljumpingchallenge to raise money for people with colorectal cancer, anyone?
i think this is a great response. thank you for being professional with him gone. it would be easy to just start throwing out trash with him gone and it speaks a lot about you to remain respectful even now.
reminds me of when /u/neiltyson explained that in order to justify bill gates stopping to pick up money on the street, it would need to be at least $45,000. otherwise, it's not worth his time.
so after a couple of years in college. what will you say if he wants to drop out to pursue some crazy dream of starting his own company?
piggybacking on that question, what's the best dad-joke you've come up with, or one you've felt particularly proud of?
confirmed: bill gates is in kahoots with gabe newell
interestingly bill gates was despised through the 90's for what many considered his monopoly on os's. reddit in the 90's would not have been very kind to bill gates.
former human resources here. there's a great book that explains all types of interview questions, what the employer is usually looking for in answers and how to answer base don your unique experience. it's called knock 'em dead, and is printed new every year with updates including navigating new situations brought about by technology etc. that said, if you don't want to read a book, boguskudos' answer above is a good way to answer that question.
everyone notices it's superman, but they're too polite to point it out.
genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. don't know about the playboy part but i'm sure he could get most of us in his bed if he wanted to. not at the same time, probably, but then again he's really rich so he might be able to buy a bed that big.
keep in mind the closest people to you is yourself.
i think, if we really want to promote critical thinking, we need to teach it divorced from present real world politics. because it's *always* been partisan bs in my experience.
how did you pass captcha if you're a computer ? checkmate, "computer".
1. people are idiots. 2. they don't even know how stupid they are since the gates' have already pledged to donate their entire fortune to charity when they pass. i believe their children will get a very modest inheritance (very modest by billionaire standards) and the rest goes to the foundation to improve the lives of people for years to come. bill gates and warren buffet are the carnegie's of this generation. buffet has already given over 30 billion dollars to charity, and gates will give that much or more by the time he's 'done'. amazing people.
yep, i've been waiting for aoeiv ever since the infamous instruction manual pic...
well no one here seems to have played aoe3 because all i ever see talked about is aoe2 nostalgia- why put out a 4th if the 3rd is so ignored?
microsoft and bill gates ... are not the same thing. for example, microsoft and bill gates had two hugely different views on the whole fbi/apple fiasco under tim cook. remember that? yeah, gates thought it'd be fine for apple to disable the security.. and the fbi would only use it "just this once" and all that.
in the it department for medical billing and collections here. even just everyone on epic is not a fix. we have multiple clients on epic, but the record formats vary from clinic to clinic, and state to state. hell, even in the same hospital system, depending on city, we have variations in records and they are on the same epic and meditech systems. credit reporting is way easier. they use the metro2 format and i can pull/place files and know what to expect no matter where and how they came in. medical records are a nightmare from an it standpoint. on the bright side, it keeps us busy!
anyone who is still seriously trash talking in their 60s needs to grow up.
whilst it offers an interesting perspective, those kinds of calculations assume that bill gates stopping to pick up money somehow makes his corporate earnings drop by 45k. the truth is that his constant attention isn't necessary for microsoft to continue generating profits.
"here's a small loan of a million dollars..." actually i would love for that to be the case.
i've always found it wise not to insult the intelligence of a man with eyes that can destroy you with a single look.
lol yeah who wants to be in bed with bill gates with a bunch of guys hahaha that would be super silly. lol tho if this actually is happening let me know just cause of how silly it would be lol
i mean, i rarely ever get them on the first try. maybe i'm just brute forcing them.
i remember when i was growing up, bill gates was the villain. times sure have changed.
in my subjective experience, i have more nostalgia for aoe2 as that's what i played when i was a kid, and aoe3 introduces fairly fundamental differences in game mechanics to the previous two iterations. i enjoy aoe3 in and of itself, but it doesn't feel like aoe2 or the original aoe.
it's interesting that we have videos that can play on thousands of different devices using hundreds of different video players, but medical records have yet to be standardized in any way.
haha just googled it up. interesting. are there mac ports for all windows games? i was suggested by a friend to try out one for dark souls when my mac was my only running computer, although i think that was just a mod.
i believe the calculations actually show that the 45k is roughly equivalent to your average person stopping to pick up a penny and that's why it isn't worth his time. an average persons earnings won't be reduced by a penny to pick up a penny but it's still probably not worth the time and effort.
"let me get this straight, you think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante, who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, and your plan is to blackmail this person? ....good luck."
lol, yeah, if anyone has a place and time send it to me so i know in what direction and when to laugh lol.
the whole hero worship of steve jobs and shitting on bill gates thing has never made any sense to me. people are weird.
any developer sitting at home on his laptop can change/modify/distribute video files of interest to everyone and anyone. medical records aren't really consumable or open.
still waiting for my paid protesting check mr. soros
what were women's rights like in nazi germany? out of curiosity.
*in the u.s. holocaust museum **gift shop** &nbsp; somehow doesn't sound as weighty and authoritative.
i think this is like trying to diagnose yourself online, and it's always cancer
why isn't anyone discussing what fascism really is as opposed to 'warning signs'?
didn't most of those things already exist in the us before trump?
religion and government intertwined? didn't the nazi party view the church as a threat to their absolute authority? disdain for intellectuals? nazi german glorified science and engineering to the point where they gave them a free pass on ethics. rampant sexism? was sexism in germany any different from sexism in most countries at the time? not saying there aren't definitely some valid comparisons, but this seems to be... really stretching it.
i remember when this sign was just about everywhere right after president obama was elected.
ok, i am unsubscribing from /r/pics as soon as i post this this sub has been nothing but politics since friday. the mods here are obviously ok with this you won't miss me with 15,000,000 subscribers still here, but i won't miss you either
i guess this is now /r/politics_pics. well, time to unsub.
i remember seeing these back when bush 2 took office. maybe don't cry hitler every time someone you don't like gets into office. you might be taken more seriously.
mussolini described fascism as "everything inside the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state". anyone who thinks trump wants government to control all aspects of society including capital, labor, education, healthcare, media, entertainment, religion, culture, sports, government, etc etc etc is either disingenuous or a fool. if anything, trump wants the exact opposite of fascism in that he wants less government.
you know what's funny - while people are busy performing mental gymnastics to try and get trump to fit all these (he doesn't), you can pick just about any islam-controlled nation on planet earth and guess what? they meet every. single. one.
correct me if i'm wrong but hitler and the nazis viewed german women as incredibly important because they would raise the new generation of germans who would rule over the lower races. i recall that they were giving lots of medals and praise but i'm not sure about how their civil rights changed edit to quote my textbook "nazi ideology promoted strictly defined gender roles for men and women, and the state implemented a variety of social programs to encourage "racially correct" women to say home and raise "aryan" children" (a history of western society by mckay)
yeah i was gonna say i went to the holocaust museum two weeks ago i don't remember seeing this. i didn't check out the gift shop though.
"honey, i think we have hitler." "damnit phil, i told you to stop googling fascism." "oh man, there's a guy here mentioning small hands. we definitely have hitler."
because fascism is a loosely defined political concept, and a meaningful discussion would be quite involved. not really something you can do on reddit.
good question. this appears to be from a gift shop and earlier i saw a post that only had four personal facebook accounts as references. we're seeing reddit have a total melt down like how tumblr had a meltdown when they had a 'war' with 4chan.
so, first off you're wrong about religion in nazi germany. the nazis had what amounted to a state church after they silenced dissent from any church leader who spoke up. secondly, you're wrong about their views on science. science also had to fit their narrative that's why they created "german physics" which went to great lengths to try and explain why jewish physicists were wrong. also, there was a great deal 9f sex ism. girls were essentially raised to have the sole goal of being nazi baby factories.
nazi germany glorified women as child birthers and mothers, forcing them to take those roles.
60-70 years ago we had the red scare and mccarthyism, it wasn't exactly a great time for america.
that's because this was made by someone who literally just wrote a shitlist of 'why i think republicans are evil' and then said it was fascism. sexism has never had anything to do with fascism but it's item number fucking five.
trump supporters are acting like nobody gave obama shit when he was elected. they treated him with respect and accepted that he fairly won the election. that couldn't be further from the truth.
i am maybe a bit older, but i remember reagan, bush, clinton, bush, and obama all being compared to hitler in some form or another. it is more prevalent from the left, but the right gets into the act as well from time to time. there are three problems that i have with it though. first, our constitution is greater than any one man. second, it cheapens the mass murder of millions of people and the rape and torture of untold others into an ignorant political attack. finally, it does nothing to further the dialogue and change the views of others. it only pushes both sides to the edges and the middle ends up either disengaging or picking an extreme.
to be somewhat fair, this was not much different than women's roles in much of the rest of the world in the '30s. they could vote (earlier than in the u.s. oddly enough) and had rights pertaining to property, marriage and maternity that were pretty progressive. now, there were definitely societal pressures and incentives to have kids and stay home but germany was ahead in some areas and behind in others. besides, women's rights were still a relatively new thing and only made rapid strides everywhere later due to wwii itself. the nazi party itself was definitely more conservative in their views of course but they didn't expend too much effort on the matter compared to other issues. they weren't exactly bastions of tolerance and equality but that's hardly shocking now is it? no one else was either though and that should be perhaps a bit more embarrassing.
iirc there were multiple tiers of rewards for women based on how many children they had in their family too? like the more children they had the more support (economic and such) they would receive or something.
jesus, that sounds like building tons of houses in age of empires just so you can make a bigger army that you can go lose most of smashing against another army. except those were real lives he was fucking with, not a damn video game
these rights were amazing. best rights. you should've seen these women's rights
i talked to everyone about women's rights, and they say to me we got to find the **root** cause of women's rights, i've had terrific conversations about women's rights, i've won awards for women's rights, look what happen with isis, they have terrible women's rights, the worst women's right, we have to focus on isis, i've been told by many generals that isis is a tremendous problem, if we allow china to meet with isis it's going to be bad and we'll have a tremendous problem, you can't solve a problem until you figure out what is the root cause, and i have had so many people call me and say thank you and that i have a point and we have to get down to the problem and the problem is china is undercutting us on labour, it's a tremendous problem.
yes, they were viewed as really important baby making machines.
try telling your girlfriend you consider her incredibly important as a breeder. it never goes over as well as you'd think...
i went probably 15 years ago, and i still remember feeling horrible when i left. i think every citizen should visit all of the national museums at least once, but that one in particular. do they still give you a person to follow throughout the museum? when i went, they gave us a little card and every so often there was an atm like machine where you enter your card and it prints out what was going on with that person during the time frame being covered in the museum. i got a female child as my person and she died in the death camps.
one of the significant drawbacks to reddit unfortunately.
i sincerely hope trump is the closest thing to facism the u.s sees.
fair enough. i assumed a holocaust museum would be mostly concerned with nazi germany.
i'd say intellectuals mostly points to philosophers and stuff.
yeah now it's time to make the mans jobe to be a child birther!
no, it wasn't a great time for america. but even in that dark moment no serious academic group was labeling the us as a fascist state.
i think we can all agree most of the things on that list are pretty fucking unamerican, regardless of whether they align with fascism.
you know the whole reason why "the boy who cried wolf" is a cautionary tale is because one day, the wolf really did show up. if previous accusations of fascism turned out to be false, it really has no validity one way or another on the claims that people are making today. the constitution is indeed greater than any one man - assuming that the other checks and balances are prepared and willing to do their duty. and if people disengage because they don't like the idea that they might be tired of living through something extreme, that's not the fault of those crying fascism, that's the fault of someone too lazy or apathetic to take a stand.
yeah, that was a thing. but now every discussion that devolves to politics is that thing, everywhere.
someone mentioned this probably just meant welfare. am i terrible that i read this and immediately thought of like an mlm scheme where if i could just produce like one more baby i'd earn a television or something? welfare, meh. television? we could have another little nazi baby.
the thing is, playing games like aoe or europa, you're getting a glimpse into how world leaders think (probably). that's why i cant help but scoff whenever someone says "president / leader (insert name) cares about us", it's just so unbelievably laughable, in my opinion.
these women, they had these rights. it was unbelieveable what they were doing with these rights.
everyone called the nazis and told them "you guys have the best rights."
in relation to the men, who were viewed as really important dying machines, i'm not sure that's worse.
when i was in high school, a mentally unstable coworker at walmart came up to me out of the blue and told me i had good birthing hips. he meant it as a complete compliment. i just smiled and thanked him. then i proceeded to agonize over the size of my hips up until this very moment when i shared this story on reddit. and just fyi, i have now had two babies and both had huge heads. i managed to get them out... but i'm not sure what part my hips played in that achievement.
"please exit the gift shop through the gift shop gift shop. thank you."
i feel like if my person got out i'd be so invested in them i'd be elated. that's so rare, unfortunately.
even worse is attempting such conversations on facebook.
is it strange that for every single one of your points i can see ways in which both the right and the left fit these descriptions? does fascism transcend a layman 's right/left conception of politics?
many of my friends had such high praise for fidel castro when he died and are now calling trump a fascist dictator. some people are terrible at being objective.
reddit has always been left leaning, long before ctr was a thing.
well a warning against fascism certainly is relevant to nazi germany which is why it's there. just so happens that the warning itself isn't exclusive to one regime.
if your checklist of facism warning signs often results in false negatives that means you have a bad checklist. you called fascism on previous presidents and it didn't amount to facism. therefore we will now ignore you warning. what don't you understand about that?
thank you, it's unreal to see that people are ignoring the end of that fable while invoking it...
who was hitler before hitler was hitler? ie: during hitlers rise to power who did people compare him to? "he's worse than _______!
there was! there was a mother's cross which was awarded to mothers who had borne a certain amount of children, with tiers starting from bronze with 4-5 children to silver with 6-7 and gold with 8 or more children. iirc recipients would also have earned the right to be saluted by hitler youth.
i know, i'd never thought about it that way until just now and it's terrifying.
...and then you join the two views and realize that a woman's role was to make either more baby-making machines, or dying machines. what a fucking dehumanizing vision
hips are just important for giving birth. can't explain it because i'm not entirely sure why but they are important.
please exit to the left. if you go right, even just a bit too far, you exit in the third reich.
i think that exhibit is what got to me the most. i doubt i'll ever forget that hallway.
you're right. it's all these new people that came here recently. we should build a giant firewall... and make the hacker 4chan pay for it.
i would urge you to be more specific than simply saying left/right (which itself is an oversimplification that obscures the different embodiments and liberal and conservative philosophy/ideology), and maybe include specific examples related to the above bullet points to better further discussion. for example, i have no idea what time era or country/nation you might be referring to. but i think the short answer to your question is yes, fascism is less a range on the political/ideological spectrum than it is a certain *style* of politics. it's certainly true that fascism isn't solely wedded to conservatism (think stalin's *diamat*). but it does tend to spring from or adopt reactionary elements (traditionalism, rejection of diversity, xenophobia, militarism).
fascism and castro's socialism are two very different concepts. both authoritarian, yes, but fascism is not *just* authoritarianism
i'm sad to say i'm guilty of it as well. i'm fairly moderate in my actual political views but lean to the left, especially on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion. with the rise of donald trump i have become increasingly more hostile to anyone who leans to the right and especially of those who support trump. i am aware that this is counterproductive but when someone calls me a liberal cuck a part of my mind breaks... i'm working on it.
it's everywhere. its frustrating to see most of my friends and family (who were fairly neutral) get caught up in this post-election shit storm and all turn to an extremist approach.
the boy, or the liar, is the only one that gets eaten. the moral of the story is that liars won't be believed when they finally tell the truth. the moral of the story isn't that there is an actual wolf, the moral of the story is that you shouldn't lie if you want to be believed when you finally tell the truth.
it's tragic. how many people devoted their everything to a cause that was just some assholes game? placing it above loved ones, above their passions and happiness in life, shit, making it their life and purpose to fight for what was essentially a chessboard. i know this is some r/im14andthisisdeep type crap but i'm just saying, think about how much effort is put into dehumanization of opposition and other cultural conditioning techniques we've observed through history. they can't play the game, they can't have the war, if they can't convince you to pick up the weapon. idk, i just don't see how anyone can buy into it. but maybe thats why it's so heavily incentivized with money, school, etc etc. the scale of it all can make it difficult to understand i guess, not sure.
ever since 4chan and facebook came this place has looked more and more like a youtube comment section.
neither was castro's socialism. i'm sure the hundreds of homosexuals he threw into slave-labor internment camps would be able to explain that quite well to you; that is, if most of them weren't dead.
well, fuck you! i was neutral, now i'm going to find the position as far away from yours as possible and take it! *you fascist!*
i'm also moderate and left leaning, but went the opposite way. i'm completely sick of the left crying wolf and picking god awful petty fights with trump when they should be focusing on the important issues. the extreme pettiness just obscures the important issues at hand.
if we're going to argue semantics here, in the original version, only the sheep are eaten. it wasn't until later english versions that the boy was eaten. while the overall moral is the same, the "punishment" is a tad different.
would you rather... - be a gorillionaire (1,000,000 bananas but you are now a gorilla) - fly gorillion air (you get to stay yourself but must board a flight with a gorilla pilot)
most international terminals. duty free is kind of cool
well i'm just high, so ha! but for real, can someone explain to me how you can unironically scream bigot at someone you disagree with and refuse to listen to?
to be fair, both sides love to roll out the petty arguments. just look at all the back and forth over the inauguration crowd numbers.
yes! i'm center left (was a bleeding heart liberal in college though) and cannot stand all the ridiculous anti-trump behavior. it doesn't matter what he or anyone in the federal government are **actually** doing or saying, it's being taken out of context and blown up into nonsense to push a narrative (trump is the embodiment of evil) that is pushing reasonable people away.
gorillionaire for sure. female gorillas are known to prostitute for resources.
yeah this has been puzzling me so much lately, people screaming bigot at other people without the slightest hint of exactly just how ironic the whole thing is
what's the food like on said flight? what's the conversion rate dollars/bananas?
but then he wouldn't be a virgin anymore and we wouldn't get to burn him :(
i love how he's all "no i don't play basketball. not all tall people play basketball" but then he's like "i guess i do play vball though..."
i get irrationally angry at tall people at concerts. like they can fucking control how tall they are. they're out here ruining my good time with their height like it's a shitty personality trait. why do you have to be so tall asshole. i can't see the show. fuck.
i really want to make a card that says something along the lines of "yes i'm in a wheelchair. no i'm not retarded. yes i'm such a inspiration. no i don't need help with anything. we should do this again sometime."
passive aggressive level 10. this guy has made his life so much more streamlined. i can't imagine having to deal with that same inane question a dozen times each day.
i have a running joke with the short people in my life (as i'm 6'5"): i'll happily reach item such as such on that very high shelf with the understanding that if i drop my car keys, you are now the one responsible for picking them up.
i'm 6'8", can confirm the daily "wow, you're tall" drives all of us mad.
doesn't answer the most essential question of all. the one we are all thinking about.
as a graphic artist, i can relate. my office used to be in an open second floor area that was right next to the stairs, so every fucking time any sales person walked up or down, coming in, going on break, coming back, going out to lunch, coming back, going on another break, coming back, leaving for the day, each one would ask me mundane questions or would want to chitchat and bug me about their accounts that are in my queue of stuff to do. the ceo took pity on me and had walls installed. oh, sweet solitude.
typing "good" would've taken less work than "see answer 1"
i have a friend who is 6'9" but really gangly looking and pretty uncoordinated. his favorite response to "wow, you're tall! do you play basketball?" is "wow, you're short! do you play miniature golf?"
and for the british....well we understand feet and inches as we can't choose a side
living in a country that uses the metric system, this thread gives me aneurysms.
as a tall person who often goes to shows and who likes to stand in the crowd, i often feel like the people behind me probably hate me so thank you for confirming that
tall person here, i learned to just go to the back eventually. especially at festivals and concerts with crowd surfers... my head was a speed bump.
i was at a show for a band i wasn't super familiar with. my friends were fans, i was just tagging along. we went early enough to get right up by the stage. in my lack of caring i left enough space for someone to slip in front of me during the opening band. some short guy slipped in. i didn't really mind since i'm 6'3" and he was probably only 5'8". then when the headlining band came on short guy held an iphone up in the air trying to record the show. i never again felt bad about blocking a shorter person's view after that.
wow! i never considered that height could be a reason for handicapped parking. it makes sense. is it just the height, or is the parking space tag for another disability which also caused the height anomaly. e.g. severe scoliosis, leg amputation, etc. also, is anomily the right word to use, or is that insensitive?
seriously, i've definitely seen this exact picture before. where's the damn pitchforks.
i was was wondering why i had a sudden craving for some delicious gedunk food
there is only 1 context clue in this photo and it's a philly clue...how exactly did you deduce that this was taken at gcc?
your edit to this comment is the most reddit thing i have ever seen, get over yourself
i'm not tall - 180cm, but my wife is all of about 5' nothing. if i want to fuck with her i just put things on the higher shelves out of her reach!
eagles fan. can confirm. fuck dallas in particular.
the best part about being colorblind is when people say you're faking it because you called the objects they ask about the right color. "yes, both of those are the same color to me, but one of them is much more commonly used on (object), so i just picked the more common one."
damn, $300? i'd take a pair of those before my ps4 any day, of it meant i could see correctly. i thought that they were super expensive, but for what it provides, that's super cheap.
yes i am a card yes i know it's vertical yes i know im a card that has a card
headphones used to work for me. half the time i wasn't even playing music or listening to anything. just having them on is a signal to leave you alone. oh, and it's better to have the big blocky headphones so it's a bigger hassle to take them off. people might not see the ear buds.
ex-copywriter here. at least your kind have stuff that says "i'm working", like a graphic tablet or 32 open photoshop tabs. the number of times people saw me staring at a wall and interpreted it as an invitation to converse or even ask me if things are okay is too damn high.
just looked it up and apparently they sleep by shutting down half a brain at a time. that's fucking sick.
haha im so using that even tough im 6'6 and play basketball.
you're also the only people on the planet who understand stone as a weight measure.
i always get a roomy cone of space behind me. that happen to you too?
at least you don't sit in the center of a john wick screening with a giant afro as well. god, i hate that guy. he even looked back at me 3 times, seemingly to check if he was blocking anyone's view. well if you saw me sitting as straight as possible yes it was because you decided youd sit dead center with your recliner all the way up to cover a third of the screen
i'm 5'0 and i have no shame when it comes to asking tall people if i can stand in front of them at shows. it's not like i'll be blocking their view! 9 times out of 10 they have no problem with it.
sometimes people appreciate it though as well. i often use tall people at raves as like markers for where my friends are in the crowd.
how would height make sense for handicap parking..
nah you've probably seen a different picture of the same card. it's a template and people just use it and change the height on it, and variations of it get posted ad nauseum both on here and on /r/tall
it's to demonstrate cb's obsession as a reflection of competition in 90's consumerist america. we can clearly see that there's a negligible difference, but to cb it's enough to consume him and drive him to murder.
man the phantom of the opera movie was super fucking rapey now that i think about it.
i heard fuck dallas on the wind and was summoned here.
red light is on top, and the green light is seeded with blue so a r/g colorblind person can see it anyway.
then the card's card would need its own card to explain how it was able to print a card so small.
but then you have assholes pulling your headphones/earbuds off/out and you eventually get convicted for murder.
probably the gays. they go to play and never get past the parking lot thinking of all those balls so they blow each other for an hour and go home.
yep. the worst is that they'll hold their beer or cocktail at the height of my head while dancing. i haven't been to a show in a while where i didn't get beer in my hair that crusts and clumps up.
i'm on reddit way too much considering i knew exactly what this was going to be before i clicked on it.
hah, yes, i typo'd "typo". i will think of this for years to come and make a small noise to myself as i relive the embarrassment.
but why do all their cards say vp? you know, i should really read the book.
well i mean... deformed guy stalks an actress and then kidnaps her and keeps her in a basement.
exactly. i'm sure i've seen this business card before, and no i haven't seen this guy
feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight!
well if a card's card is smaller than it, then the card explaining that would be even smaller and need a card explaining the additional minification technology, entering a loop.
i think the judge will understand and let him off with parole.
i switched from pitchfork to sensible chuckle there so quickly
i'm 4'11", just the perfect height to get elbowed in the face by people who need to be front row and right below everybody's very full drinks. i know that people are going out to have some fun and listen to music with their friends. i also know that, if i don't like large crowds, i should really just stay home. but i really wish that people wouldn't dance while holding drinks! at least drink half of it before going ape shit, please!
i've told this story before on reddit, but once in high school i was talking to a girl about my driving lessons. i am a dwarf (4'0"), and i could see confusion growing on her face as i spoke, so i paused, waiting for her to ask me the inevitable "how do your feet reach the pedals?"/"how do you see over the steering wheel?" questions i usually get "....because of your size....do you need a smaller engine in your car?" i just looked at her nonplussed. "uh...nnno?" to this day i still don't understand the train of thought that brought her to that question.
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?
i've always wanted to see a 1000+ comment go negative shortly after one of those fucktard edits.
there are many vice presidents in a company. evp's, svp, etc...
normally, i would be all over recommending that someone read more: but american psycho is intense. it's a very well written book, and it explores a disturbing facet of the human experience. but, it is still intense. you should be aware of that before reading it.
i'm 6'7", and i get sent links to various versions of this business card almost as often as i get comments about my height
so, do you deliver your own mail? or do you have your own mailperson? but then, who delivers his mail? is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? well, i guess a p.o. box could, in theory, break the chain.
yes, i had a girl sophomore year of high school do it to me semi-frequently. despite being friends with her, it was still really irritating. it's like an unwritten rule to not fuck with someone's ear buds. very easy way to put me in a bad mood.
i'm 6'4. if we're at a show and i'm in front of you. tap me on the shoulder and we can switch. i don't give a shit. i'm 6'4, i'm literally god.
4'11" too. i've had to attend concerts on my husband's shoulders.
as a woman who is 4'9.5" i have lost count of how many times drinks have been accidentally spilled on me because i'm underneath everyone....
i know you probably get this all the time, but is your penis as big as your leg?
my wife always laughs hysterically at this scene. i think she might be damaged.
i do my part and downvote any post-karma edit i see. nobody upvoted you for you stupid edit.
good guy redditor - gets corrected, doesn't edit his comment to look like he was right all along.
and by intense he means there are horrific scenes of gore and depravity that the movie doesn't even come close to depicting.
i'm 5'2" and nobody ever gives me business cards about my awesome tallness ='[
ah, just the kind of whimsical nonsense i come to the comments for
high school sophomores are not actual people. i'm wondering if normal adults do that.
they probably can't reach your shoulder. how's a butt tap?
no matter how much you try, you will always be adorable.
somewhere out there, there is a 4'9" tall woman thinking to her self "look at this uppity bitch. she just had to add the .5" on there."
well i've definitely not had that variation of the question before. let's just say that my form of dwarfism doesn't affect my party zone. so yes, yes it is.
im 5'1" and im a 20 y/o male... this is depressing
spiking volleyballs from the front must be an awesome experience
5' on the button here. no business cards here either. can we get a 4'11" person to reply to continue the chain?
do your feet reach the floor? shame on anyone who sees this as a deficit. i am one of those women 5'6" who has never let a mans height get in the way of my relationship with them. i hope someday you find all those people in your life who feel height does not matter. prince was 5'2! kevin hart the same. danny divito (and white doesn't live danny?) 5' your name goes here!!
good luck, all chicks be putting i dont date short men in profiles.
fellow 6'2 - we are the shortest of the tall people. we can be both proud and emasculated simultaneously
cia has finally managed to kill castro with its innovative "old age" technique
damn. somebody get gorbachev for an ama before all the remaining cold war figures are gone.
raul has been leading for a while so it is unlikely much will change
i expect a netflix special soon. this dude had a crazy life.
about a half hour ago i was reading the wikipedia page about snowden, saw, castro's name and had one of those 'is he still alive?' thoughts. then i remembered he was. except he wasn't. strange!
i'm actually pretty surprised about this death. i started assuming he was immortal.
now he and kennedy can play risk and hide-n-go-seek in valhalla.
the cia's plan to slowly assassinate castro over 90 years was a complete success.
south florida is going to be losing the shit tonight in celebration.
any news on the cause of death? and here i thought 2016 was done being crazy.
was he on the "who you can't believe isn't dead yet" list?
*silently hoping 2016 finishes off kim jong un too*
still a month to go in 2016. my money's on the queen going before the year is out.
took 20 minutes to reach #1 on r/all. this thread is going to be huge.
why did they assume carter would outlive bush 41? they're both 92.
lpt: always do that type of stuff in another color.
gorbachev recently started to say a lot of things like us betrayed pact made during the twilight of ussr etc.
as someone who is half cuban and lived in cuba when i was a kid, fidel was a figure very much ingrained with national identity of all the cuban people and every aspect of life on the island. this will be a turning point in my country's history.
2016 succeeds where the cia failed so many times (assuming this year wasn't some elaborate cia conspiracy).
so were the assassins just shit-tier incompetents, or was this fabian dude some op enzio motherfucker?
well well well, a 5 year bet finally paid off, lol
here come the satellite trucks. the county and city emergency operations centers have a plan just for this, and police/fire will be on 12 hour shifts starting roll call next shift.
i live in south florida.. give it a few hours, i am sure there will be festivals and parties everywhere
just roll queen liz in bubble wrap and have another pint until this shit blows over in a month.
dude was 90 years old. this wasn't shocking or unexpected (like trump , brexit, or a whole bunch of other shit that happened)
he was 90, so my money is on a parachute failure while base jumping.
he was as old as dicks. i would guess natural causes.
i wonder who or what's next. i feel like this year is saving the best for the end, and i'm terrified. honestly, did dicaprio's oscar unleashed this madness??
2016 has better writers than house of cards and game of thrones combined
he was already out of power. his brother runs things.
bush 1 isn't in the best health while carter is still building houses for the poor.
news sites have a lot of pre-made articles for famous obituaries. they just add a time-stamp and modify a few facts.
i'm surprised to see an mgs3 reference in /r/worldnews
i'm actually starting to seriously consider 2016 *was* the cia conspiracy.
the cia was (and is) actually terrible at assassinations. when you're specifically prohibited from doing something (by us law, the cia can't carry out assassinations), you wind up with no one who's good at it when you're asked to do it under the table. if you need a 'threat to the west' taken out ask mossad or mi-6, they have a lot more experience.
five years ago, wow. and to the day it looks like! nostradamus over here!
the funny thing is i made it after hearing he was in poor health and figured i wouldn't have to wait long. didn't expect him to make it to 90 but i'm not at all surprised he didn't survive 2016.
given all the thing he survived it definitely didn't seem like just dead, besides it seems soon. he is the man with the most attempts to his life.
don't let trump, brexit, or a whole bunch of other shit distract you from the fact that the golden state warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the nba finals against the cleveland cavaliers
nah, shit began hitting the fan before that. alan rickman died in january.
no it was bowie. he was the glue holding this version of reality together, now we're flying apart at the seams.
2016 just sits at home and throws darts at random names and events and says, "why the fuck not?"
if hillary somehow manages to become president from the recount, november will be the red wedding of 2016.
just did. he literally jumped out of bed and i'm really trying to hold back tears. it doesn't change anything at the moment, but this is something my community has been looking forward to for a very long time.
i don't know, he seems to have a pretty dry sense of humor. also, he outlived castro, which is hilarious and he agrees with me.
yea but fidel was so ancient they had to include ghwb in his timestamp
queen elizabeth will outlive the news outlets just you watch.
seriously though. it would be hilarious to continously see the list of people she outlived grow longer and longer each year they update the obituary.
depends, if you go to little havana in miami right now, there are people throwing parties. if you ask my cuban communist grandfather and all his friends, they're grieving. if you ask the people of cuba at this very moment, you can't really get an answer because the base expression they can only give is sorrow for the tragic loss of their figurehead.
if 2016 is gonna end, it's gonna go out with a bang.
but it had terrible accuracy. think of all the people 2016 took before hitting that target...
exploding cigar is up there for me as well..who was trying to kill him? wile e. coyote?
he was an avid diver and the cia was desperate, they hoped he'd see a (brightly painted) conch and pick it up on one of his dives.
the us military is better at targeted assassinations than our foreign intelligence department. granted they use robots with fucking missiles, not exactly the most elegant weapon, but hey... when they get some actual useful intel, my my, look at the time, drone o'clock.
the year is 2100. the nuclear war has decimated the world, capitals flattened, law non-existent. those killed in the blast are envied, as the radiation spread by the wind killed countless. my feet take me westwards, to the green fields of georgia, the fertile land of the ancient tribal chieftain jimmy carter, his magic peanuts granting him eternal life in a mortal world.
honestly it seems insane that he's survived this long. u.s. playing the long con assassination scheme.
how about the cleveland indians blowing a 3-1 lead to the chicago cubs?
wrong. when lemmy died last december, he tore the gates of hell off the hinges on his way down, and shit started getting sucked in.
a book would be universally panned for all these unrealistic and unnecessary deaths. we'd get pissed at the author for trying to clean house so transparently.
i was born in '91, so my only real frame of reference for bush 1's personality is the simpsons caricature. and i imagine his old wrinkled yellow face seeing this and going "heheheheh.. outlived ya' bastard!"
i mean, bush is two years *older* than castro was, so it makes sense to have that.
he should watch his back. i hear nic cage has a thing for national treasures.
i've heard a lot about how castro was protecting a lot of people, and with him gone, there could be a ton of bloodshed.
some people can smoke one cigarette and die of skin and lung cancer while another person can smoke every day and live to be the oldest recorded person (jeanne calment)
i live in australia and for some reason we are now also doing black friday. this is stupid. we already had boxing day.
lemmy is the one mortal who could either befriend or dethrone lucifer and turn hell into a twisted sort of rock god paradise. that being said i wonder if lemmy will get the 2pac treatment and have shit releasing years and years after his death
nice try, cia. you almost fooled us, but you forgot one thing... reddit *always* reads usernames.
wouldn't be 2016 if some more fucked up shit didn't happen, now would it?
i knew justin trudeau was the son of a former prime minister of canada - didn't expect to see baby pics of him with fidel frekkin' castro.
dude what the fuck. don't egg 2016 on. it will deliver.
castro and pe trudeau were good friends. castro came to canada in september 2000 for trudeau's funeral
don't worry, it's a joke account. cabinets are vehemently ephebophilic, they wouldn't touch a child of their own will.
that is... definitely illegal in my state. which makes me want it more. that's the coolest firework ever.
imagine bringing this shit back to medieval times and setting it off near an enemy camp, they would think you are god.
any video/picture of the actual firework before they set it off? just curious how big this thing is.
if i ever go back in time, i will bring this so people will fear me for generations
gandalf is gonna be yankin some ears over this shit
aiiight, what the name of this and where do i buy it
does anyone know where i can actually buy one of these?
you should probably read *a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court*. mark twain's got you all set on this one.
firing it *near* an enemy camp? how about directly over it? by about ten feet? you'd never have any more enemies after you light their entire camp on fire and kill hundreds of them in the ensuing chaos.
i thought it was like the brand name or type of fireworks maybe?
people say the best weapon is one you never need to fire. i disagree. i believe the best weapon is one you only need to fire *once*.
how would you launch a big one like this in the past?
and they said no one would watch a video of fireworks
watched this one recently, laughed my ass off in that scene glad theres so much malcolm in the middle love on reddit
judge: half of the state has burnt down! but by god was that shit dope.
maybe the police would be so impressed they'd just ignore it.
how long do you think it'll take them to realize it's not the apocalypse?
those 48 inch mortars weigh about 2 tons each, and cost about $2000 in raw materials. lol
well, i have lived in alabama long enough to know that, in these cases, there is only one rule you must follow. find someone to hold your beer.
the reason these are illegal isn't because *you* might kill yourself; it's because you might kill *the neighbours*.
it's still illegal even with the proper license where i am...
molly connolly just broke up with me over the revealing nature of the song
uh no. look at how op said "fireworks". fire works. he's just fucking stupid.
thats how dad did it, thats how america does it... and its worked pretty well so far
wow that sounds like a weird blend of italian/arabic
anyone else notice how the scenes are not the same when the large firework goes off?
if the firework weighs approximately 95kg i might have a device that could launch it 300 meters.
you can see me now cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind.
i literally watched this last night, wtf is this baader meinhof shit going on
pretty much captures the ambivalence of bootleg fireworks guy.
"because we have no water to put out the resulting fire otherwise"... dang drought
oh thank god. they are fucking pieces of shit. time to buy a cannon i guess.
so, just so we're clear here... you're talking 48" in diameter? like, a shell 4 friggin feet across? (note: not doubting you just clarifying)
damn you for showing me this rabbit hole. off i go...
apparently it's maltese. and i guess it's unsurprising that maltese could be described like that.
the trebuchet is a superior siege platform from which to launch a projectile, especially if trying to impress the ancients with god like intelligence
wow. i was there that night, at a restaurant on the water. it was shortly before the show was supposed to start, so i went to the bathroom. i heard real loud noises and when i came back my family told me what i missed.
one of my all time favorite moments in television.
i like how they mirrored it. my guess is to avoid dmca take down?
i just added it to my list. my expectations are low based on its perfect 3/5 stars.
yes that would be the diameter. the biggest shell i've ever shot was a 36" shell and let me tell you.. that scared the ever loving shit out of me. even loading the 8" and 12" shells is nerve wrecking, so i can't imagine dealing with something of this size. btw see my edit on the specs of the shell in this gif.
i, too, always miss the coolest shit by mere seconds.
i have been too old for that show since it came out but i still watch every episode with my kids each summer and enjoy every bit of it.
others have answered the movie, but i will suggest you see it. it starts off as generic mildly eerie space mystery and then suddenly morphs into hellraiser. you almost don't even have time to process what the fuck is going on before the horror.
just me but i fucking love that movie. and sphere (also on netflix now) and the abyss.
at a certain point does the size even matter? i mean i imagine even an 8-12 inch shell would likely kill you if it went off while loading so what's the worry about loading a bigger one. it's not like the bigger shells can make you extra dead, unless its possible to die so hard you use multiple reincarnations in that one death.
i just realized i think the first thing he says is "money earnin mt. vernon" (from heavy d).
it also has the exact same explanation of folding space that interstellar uses. only with vanessa.
roommate and i watched about 20 mins of it high as monkeys about 20 years ago. he got up, ran to tv and yelled "no more! no more!" as he shut it off. never seen another second. still joke about it.
i think that's just the wilhelm scream of folding space explanations.
did they actually say that in the movie? i wasn't trying to make a reference to it. i seriously hate that movie. i had f'ing nightmares for a week after i saw it. i wish i could say i watched it tripping on lsd or some other psychodelic drug, but i was sober. and it gave me nightmares. for a week. so fuck that movie.
my dad bought a sports car and kept telling me about all the chicks he was banging. hated that time period.
this reminds me of the malcom in the middle episode "hal quits"
dad shoes- check dad belly -check dad shorts-check can confirm your dad is a dad.
that painting is a-fucking-mazing. after my divorce all i did was bang a 20 year old daytona stripper, goddamnit what am i doing with my life.
does he always paint in front of a guillotine? how emo of him
that looks soooo amazing, i'd buy a print of it! i want it on my wall!!!
so badass. my dad starts projects, goes on a drug binge and never finishes.
definitely thought that was a guillotine behind the painting...
my parents just got divorced and stopped talking to me. worked out for the best in the end i suppose
ugh my dad is in the telling me about the chicks he's banged stage, hasn't gotten the sports car yet tho
god i'm so glad it's not i only me. i'm 32. my dad left when i was 22 so it was like ok i can feel ya. my mom a great person but she's a toxic drinker. we both hated it. but he bitched out. well he has a new wife who's trailer trash with 2 kids with her. and he's trying me to get with him on a double team of her... he told me that one day and i swear my head did the stewie griffin tilt to the side ... then he's trying to get me to back his wife's younger (20) sister who don't get me wrong she's a butherface which i could forgive. but damn bro. she's sooooo stupid. legally. but smart enough to hold a convo but not smart enough to think past that. and i just can't do it. i'm not smart but god damn i need someone on my level of dumb not 4 stages below me.
this. i love it and wish i had the money to afford original art.
so he went from seeing the world from far-away in dull colours, to seeing the world more closely in more details with more colours.
curious to know how the galleries and clients are feeling about it. personally i think changing styles is a great way to grow, but sometimes people are disappointed.
my dad does cocaine, drinks whiskey, and says shitty stuff about my mother.
dude, the new painting blows that older one out of the water. he's really on to something.
the old style is very common, and pretty bland imho (though it likely sells well). this has movement and depth the other one didn't. one of the photography guidelines is to have something interesting in the front third, middle third, and back third, and this has that.
that's some awesome artwork. you're lucky to have some a talented dad.
could you expand on the multi-layer glazing process? some kind of varnish or other medium?
i'd still consider you an artist, just more of a face painter.
i'm doing the same since we got separated but i go for 40 years old ladies. i personally feel sex with them is just a lot better. more experience, hunger for everything, etc. plus you can also talk with them (i am 42). i would feel weird with a 25 as soon as i come.
i think op mentioned it was a motorized easel but now all i see is medieval neck snapper
maybe you can find him on tinder if you're in salt lake city!
[you can contact him through his website!](www.skorut.com) pm me and i can give you some more info.
that's his motorized easel he built! that small controller by his foot allows the whole painting to move up and down. sounds like a fucking banshee when he uses it--there were a lot of nights where i couldn't sleep cause he'd be up painting and using that thing.
but he wouldn't have gotten as many internet points with such a concise title. no but really i am also getting tired of people sharing such personal details of their relatives on the internet to tug on other's heart strings
parents are supposed to divorce each other, not you. :(
does he wear plaid? if so, your dad might be a lesbian.
man, what a great episode. hal was probably my favourite character in the series.
omg what episode is this from? i remember him ending up all covered in paint while totally naked. i always wondered if he was really naked or only wishful vision. so yeah what episode?
mine wastes his money on scammers and talks shit about my mother's money management in the family.
i read this in my best stereotypical italian guy accent to make up for your extra word
yes it is! pm me if you'd like some more info. :)
well he had to pay her. i don't think that's bragging.
if you've ever been to a daytona strip club you'd learn it's nothing to brag about. actually probably better to lie and pretend it never happened
do you know what festival in denver and when? i live in co and see there's a couple galleries here he's in, but i'd like to go to the festival.
i love how you're covering all the bases here... promoting dad's artwork, and getting dad dates. he should keep you around. p.s. i'm a fellow artist and friends with your dad on facebook... as soon as i saw the thumbnail i knew who it was and recognized his new piece!
do you know if he plans reproducing the one you posted?
at port lligat, dali had a huge one that goes down into a slot in the floor.
ideally, parents are **not** supposed to divorce each other :( :(
so he can become a dad and come full circle. source: am dad (who was previously fit and somewhat fashionable).
malefashionadvice is mostly a bunch of 17-23yo metros dudes that somehow have $475 to spend on an outfit for every hour of the week. it's a vacuum.
he's also got that dad gut which makes me happy that it's still possible for me to be a badass even with my doughiness
one of the reasons i couldn't get into breaking bad, hal was such a more enjoyable character to watch.
art is incredibly subjective. i tend to find abstract stuff is a bit.... messy for my liking. i cant' see past the apparent randomness of it. realistic stuff just feels too boring, i'd rather have something spectacular like an incredible view someone took a picture of, or a cool nebula or something. this strikes a nice blend of the 2 howver, i really enjoy it.
if you don't mind me asking, what range does your father's work usually sell in? i'm interested as well.
much less than what he had to pay the wife, i'm sure.
i'm pretty sure it's the cherry creek arts festival. i will double check with him and pm you when i find out!
typical italian? man, i assure you we're not like that.
welcome to reddit. over here? that is not considered a gut.
i liked it as a kid because i identified with the boys but now that i'm older, i can't stand how unruly those children are. it's a burning reminder that i'm turning into an old fart
interesting. despite literally being the same person, i'm hardly able to associate the two characters. bryan cranston is a great actor.
most pieces are maybe 45"x45" and sell from $8,000-$10,000. i wish he was here and he could probably answer this a bit better!
do we always have to twist the knife in these comment chains? cant we just stick it and leave it for a change?
it's just a good start. like a yamaka before you reach full fedora.
quite possibly the greatest review on malcolm in the middle ever written.
little shit to old fart. and so the journey goes...
today you just educated a lot of people on the cost of real great art.
love is pain. you gotta rip that band-aid off now. you'll thank me later.
all i could think of while rewatching the show is "hal & lois have the patients of saints because i would destroy those children".
same, although i'm sure an upvote would have covfefed the sjsjja idefefe.
i completely agree. those kids made a strong case for corporal punishment. (also, just trying to be helpful, but, it's "patience")
can somebody eli5 me why this painting is more expensive than the one made by op's dad, while the vast majority of people would agree with me in saying the latter is more aesthetically pleasing? i understand beauty lies in the eye of the beholder but ... i mean, look at it.
i wish people would stop pointing at rothko paintings and say that they could do the same thing, why is it worth $90 mil, etc etc etc. rothko is a fucking master at evoking feeling with texture and color combinations. if i had that kind of cash, i would gladly plunk it down on a rothko.
one of my key standards for a good baseball analyst is whether they put an s on rbi.
came here looking for this comment, which couldn't have conveyed either a sudden stroke, or the literacy of us president, any better.
probably who the creator is. having something made by someone famous in the art worlds bumps the price up.
normally the pieces that sell for the most were revolutionary or influential in some way. a lot of art is intended to be aesthetically pleasing, but that's not it's only possible value. that would be akin to saying that the point of watching a movie is for it to be fun, and to discount great and tragic dramas for not fitting that.
the only "feeling" i get is "meh" when i look at that.
i think i was here last year on reddit when the last one came out. i'll see ya next year, op.
hilarity for charity was started by seth and his wife lauren in 2012. hfc is a fund that benefits the alzheimers association. i was able to go to events for hfc the past four years, taking each iteration of this picture. check out hilarityforcharity.org for more information on what hfc does and their events.
*checks op's post history* *last post 1 year ago and about meeting seth rogen on an annual basis* alright, it checks out, great photo.
*ah-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh!* ~seth rogan, probably
could you explain how you come into contact with seth rogen on an annual basis?
i can hear the laugh and the last picture's laugh and the the last and the last.
for some reason you look like a cardboard cutout placed next to seth rogen.
so, do you guys just call each other and arrange it at this point?
you know what, when you start getting into your 30's, a year is nothing. i had lunch with some guy a year ago, randomly saw him and we just instantly started up the conversation where we left off.
i think seth and i both really want to keep it going
i misread the first part as hillary for charity which sounds like a hillary clinton circlejerk gala
how sad is it that i recognised op from his previous post?
seth and his wife lauren started hilarity for charity in 2012, hfc spreads awareness and raises money to benefit the alzheimers association. ive had the opportunity to meet seth at hfc events and take these pictures over the past four years.
glad im not the only one who was going to post this...
that's awesome, you can totally claim him as a personal friend now.
could you give an example of how your conversation went this year? like, did you come up, and hold up the photo, and were alike, "photo time, come on seth", or how does it work?
i really hope this keeps going for decades, op, and in 2050 you and seth are like ancient and still meeting up to do this every year, and they do a bit on the tomorrow show about it, then it becomes a lifetime movie. or something.
has he ever asked for a copy of the picture? i want to believe that he also has this picture hanging on the wall in his house.
can confirm. i'm 33 years old. years seem like weeks, weeks seem like minutes, minutes seem like seconds. it's nuts, man.
i had this same conversation with a friend once and while we were talking his grandfather came in the room and said "i thought the same thing at your age, but time doesn't really speed up until you hit 80. i swear it's like every 15 minutes i'm eating breakfast again."
you know what would be funny? next year he's the one that posts it as "my annual picture with /u/kokomocs".
oooh look at you mister fancy with "seth" this and "seth" that, us commoners have to refer to him as "mr. rogen" joe rogen that is
it's funny that pirates were always going around searching for treasure, and they never realized that the real treasure was the fond memories they were creating. -me
this latest event was in nyc, check the hfc website for more details
i have an annual picture with randy couture, so...yeah....
i thought it was familiar too. i may have a reddit problem.
context: the kid who does the same kind of annual picture-in-a-picture-in-a-picture thing with adam savage recently came out as transgender in the latest iteration of the photo.
but can i use him as a reference when applying for jobs?
do they hang after? eat lunch? invited to any backstage stuff with him? offers to meet up for other events or collabs? or is it just a quick pic then you are whisked off?
now i'm imagining the sad photo of one of the two of them taking the last picture with a coffin. now i'm imagining a hilarious picture of an old seth rogen giving a big thumbs up with a goofy smile next to a coffin.
i'm 36 in july. i just turned 33 last week. 40s+ seem scarier because of this. it's like i'm perceptually done with 80% of my life.
im only 29, and i already feel this way it's honestly crazy how fast time starts go by. a buddy of mine is moving out of town, so i figured i should hang with him a few more times before he leaves. we hung out the other day, and it was just like old times. i realized today that that was almost 30 days ago. he might already be gone.
my grandma at 93 at the end of her life said she still felt 18 in a broken body.
it'd be even funnier if one year seth rogen is replaced by jonah hill
op is actually seth. he found some guy during the event where the first pic was taken. seth was really baked and had an idea. he would pay for this guy to come to the event every year and start the picture train. he would then make an account, which op says is only for these pictures, and post every year to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. promote his organization yearly and reep in the sweet sweet kharma that we all thirst for. until 1998 when the undertaker
deep thoughts!! i use to have the books in my bathroom and periodically you'd hear people cracking up in there.
i'm noticing a pattern here. seth give a thumbs up in each annual picture, but you only give a thumbs up every other year.
well if you look at the pic it looks like he did it on an on and off basis. one year op would put his thumb up and the next he wouldn't. this year just happened to be the one when he does.
work history: "collaborated with seth rogen on multiple successful media projects."
i'm 35 and i am well aware of the rapid downhill trajectory.
even funnier if no one would acknowledge the fact that seth was replaced with jonah, not even jonah.
i heard there's some kind of tragedy about a sith... what was his name again?
okay make sense.. i fully expect no thumb up next year . op please take note
this trend started in 2012, making it 5 years old. this is reddit, not oppressive okcupid. he can do it.
in the least rude way possible, there ~~is~~ was a typo

i've seen shittymorphs comments since i joined reddit and today was the first time i've ever actually seen the gif
as a former wild-land firefighter, the public is filled with fucking idiots and i am amazed by the fires started by people's sheer stupidity.
"wokey bear"... "your honor, it's *completely* different."
i've had many a sleepless night knowing that i am the only one out of several billion people that could prevent forest fires. i even went as far as moving to the arctic circle to distance myself from forests as much as possible. my family would write me periodically to inform me of forest fires in the states. how is this possible? i'm living on ice, eating seal, and fucking penguins. there's no way i could have done that! i killed myself last week to prevent forest fires once and for all. it was a tremendous sacrifice, but one that needed to be made. you're welcome, earth.
smokey the bear is the mascot for the national forest service, not the nps. they are separate entities.
"when i was a kid, i remember seeing smokey the bear on tv saying, "only you can prevent forest fires." so i'd sneak out of the house in the middle of the night with a bucket of water." (credit to comedian steven wright).
best way to eliminate forest fires is to cut down all the trees.
"only you can *postpone* forest fires." seriosuly, forest fires are natural. lots of trees have evolved fast burning foliage and thick bark to survive them. some tree seeds use heat to spread their seeds. but if the undergrowth doesn't get burned out often enough, then it builds up, and then once there finally *is* a fire, it's too hot to survive because of all the kindling. that bear has been tricking us. he's got us gathering fuel for our own funeral pyre.
i want to buy a shirt with this on it. can anyone tell me where i can buy a shirt like this?
they haven't been defunded though. i guess the circle jerk is strong though.
a cut in budget is not de-funding. typical hyperbole.
lol nope, the usfs budget has been going straight up for years.
the marketing and advertising is really goofy. i hear their commercial often on the radio in indiana and the mid west where there is virtually no threat of forest fires. money better spent elsewhere.
on a serious note... how often did they stop forest fires anyway? cause it feels like at least once a year some part of california's forestry burns to the ground.
smokey the bear is a relic of an old and shitty understanding of nature. forest fires are a natural part of the life cycle of a forest. without them, you end up with a situation where there is a massive amount of basically tinder that should have burned up in small fires years ago. instead, after humans spend decades preventing forest fires, eventually a lightning bolt hits and we are left with wildfires that are gigantic and devastating and completely unnatural and would have been completely avoidable if smokey the fucking bear hadn't been leading a charge to prevent small manageable forest fires in the first place. get fucked smokey.
sorry. you liberals spent all your money on illegal aliens, welfare, corrupt unions, middle east wars, and funding other countries so they can make solar panels (where the money gets stolen anyway).
collectively, we have funded many things for many generations. in the us, the uk, the eu - whatever you like. things have worked for 70 years just fine. why are we suddenly all so poor that we can't afford the things our parents enjoyed for decades? and why do my parents live in fucking mansions while i struggle to make rent for a shitty flat? there are a lot of questions need answering in this day and age. i might suggest violence, but they've armed the police to the teeth too these days. protest is pointless.
oh what, so you're telling me i cant play with fire works in a dense forrest? pfft
my brother's wife is a firefighter for the forest service. yeah... people don't know the first thing about fire safety.
honestly, i bet it would help to establish that it was parody and thus fair use.
how can you prevent forest fires all the way from the arctic circle!? you interpreted this all wrong! only you can prevent the fires! not by avoiding forests, but by protecting them with your unawakened ability. your great great great great grandfather was a mighty native american chief whose name translated to "smokes with bears". he was able to telepathically communicate with all bears within a 10,000-mile radius. the bears were only used for putting out fires that were caused by lightning, uncontrolled bonfires, and tribal wars. the keepers of the forrest, 'smokes with bears' would use his shaman powers to imbue them with anti-flammable polyester coats so that they would use their bodies to smother all flames. this is your calling. now go smoke with some bears.
here's a fun fact. it's actually "smokey bear" with no "the" in between. weird, huh?
i feel like most people don't know this. until you've been to both and then the differences are totally obvious. parks are... parky. people everywhere, booths where you pay money, rangers everywhere, etc. national forest... well, you may not see another human.
tl;dr: the national park service hasn't been defunded, its budget for this year is nearly identical to last year and the budget for next year will see a drop of 6%, after receiving increased funding over the past few years for the centennial.
not sure what you're trying to get at. that's what interior is asking for. scaled down to meet the political realities wherein trump and much of the rest of the gop would like to see the whole department wiped from existence. what they actually get this year will likely be far different and lower than what they've asked for.
guess it's not an officially licensed forest service shirt. just put a panda on there and explain "wokey's" job was outsourced.
that's why they have prescribed burns... putting out your campfire and not tossing cigarette butts should be common sense...but since it's not so common they have to run a campaign with a cartoon character to get people's attention.
there are plenty of places with very successful fire management, and excellent prescribe burning. 100% fire prevention went the way of the dodo some time ago, but is especially true on on national forests.
i don't think human caused fires are the natural ecosystem process that you are looking for.
hm yes. the middle east wars are *all* liberals fault.
it's ok, when it doesn't rain for a while the wood becomes harder and more difficult to burn.
how else am i gonna celebrate america's birthday, when jesus wrote the constitution 2,017 years ago???
the first rule of fire safety: you don't talk about fire safety.
neither smokey bear nor any federal government insignia are copyrighted. the *smokey bear act of 1952* specifically protects smokey from *ever* passing into public domain.
my gift is preventing florist fires. florists often spontaneously combust while arranging flowers - little known fact.
some native american tribes actually believed forest fires were started by the sun gods during summer when earth was passing dangerously close to their home star. my grandfather, whose name translates to "smoke on the water" and my nanna "fire in the sky" still believe this to be true even after showing them episodes of cosmos.
now i'm just a simple, small town, chicken lawyer, so correct me if im wrong here, but i'm pretty sure polyester is very flammable.
you're going to be really disappointed when oc says it's an adjective and not a verb...
it's kayjay, weird comments are kind of his thing. check out his account history. it's an art. the guy has 19 years of reddit gold.
next thing you're gonna tell me, it's berenstain bears instead of berenstein bears.
i wish, we were robbed of the greatest american sight it's citizens could ever see. what's left barely qualifies as a herd where they are. can you just imagine when there were millions of those fuckers? i would settle for 100,000 together.
thank you. i honestly don't know what to believe anymore these days.
i'm happy to see it's for sale; i'm bummed that none of the proceeds go to the national park service.
i work in the black hills and it's so overgrown from fire suppression that we still haven't gotten any prescribed burn management off the ground because the risk of catastrophic fire is too high.
humans are part of nature. trees don't give a shit if it's a lightning bolt or campfire to start the fire, how much it burns up has to do with the conditions of the forest. if it has a lot of fuel and is dry, then it needs to burn to prevent fuel buildup whether we start it or not. that's why controlled burns even exist, were just taking the randomness out of it because we know that the forest is in the condition to burn
brilliant comment. we all know they won't, and that's what makes reddit such hypocrites.
the "original creator" took two images from google and spent five minutes in photoshop. the only sham is charging $20 for a low effort shirt.
*did we give up when the germans bombed pearl harbor?!*
wait.. so it can't be copyrighted, but it can't enter public domain? what?
"only hugh can prevent florist friars" - colin mochrie
i don't know if this is an atlantis refference, but i love it none-the-less.
what other traditional native american beliefs do they have?
i was really enjoying the narrative until it got to that! unless he used "fucking" as a verb instead of an adjective, then it could work
it's clear that global warming has wiped out all penguins in the arctic area, a penguin should be a polar bear's favorite food, but it's not. you can thank arctic timber harvestation (which destroyed penguin roosting habitat) for that.
that was my first reaction when i read that too. isn't the arctic circle almost nothing but uninterrupted forest all the way through europe, asia, and north america? :d
he brings a whole new meaning to the phrase, "i'm kind of a big deal on reddit."
i thought you were kidding about the 19 years of reddit gold but, shit. that's a lot.
one minute you're defending the whole galaxy...then suddenly you're suckin' down darjeeling with...mary antoinette and her little sister

the only explanation is that we merged with an only very slightly different parallel universe.
*definitely* the random internet guy who reads all the long documents for you.
so that's like, enough for the toilet paper in the bathrooms at yosemite this summer.
crazy, cause i'm sitting in a fire engine with a bunch of other north zone black hills wildland firefighters. sure, the burns aren't as frequent or large as they should be, but prescribed burns happen.
sorry but that isn't how it really works. natural fires are less common and on average less intense. natural fires are typically ecologically beneficial but not all fires are. extremely hot intense fires are not good for the environment. these can be natural, but are more often human caused. this is because of a number of factors but for one, lightning rarely strikes when its bone dry. anyway these super intense fires can kill everything, including seeds and the microorganisms in the soil, leading to a much much longer recovery period for the ecosystems. the forest service still (very importantly) fights fires but they're more scientific about where and when. they have maps to show what areas to fight fires in and where to let them burn. in my area around 9/10 fires are human caused and fighting many of those is necessary.
doesn't change the fact that the amazon link you're advertising (yes we know it's you trying to profit) will look like pixelated shit. stop stealing shit.
yep! he's under the control of the secretary of agriculture. the royalties collected from his use go to forest fire prevention education-- over $3m has been collected by keeping him out of the public domain.
and up to six months in jail.. i can see it now: what are you guys in for? murder, selling cocaine, car theft. and you? selling counterfeit smokey the bear t-shirts.
the friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they opened up a small florist shop to raise funds. since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of god, a rival florist across town thought this was unfair. he asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. he went back and begged the friars to close. they ignored him. so the rival florist hired hugh mactaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to "persuade" them to close. hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying he'd be back if they didn't close up shop. terrified, they did so, thereby proving that: hugh, and only hugh, can prevent florist friars.
we must go deeper. if he lost fur, he would be smoky bear the bare smoking smoking bear
human fires aren't the problem. the really bad canopy fires are a side effect of ladders- medium sized trees that should've burned down already. large trees in old forests have fairly fire-resistant trunks, and won't burn unless something brings the fire to them. they stand up to normal low-level fires. after an under researched attempt to prevent all fires, there are a lot more ladders and debris to bring the fire to the canopy. bone dry doesn't matter if there isn't a way for the fire to catch the old growth, it matters now because we gave it a way.
so, what you're saying is more people should use him so they can get more funding?
he said, "what were you arrested for, kid?" and i said, "litterin'"' . . . . and they all moved away from me on the bench there, with the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean, nasty things, till i said, "and creatin' a nuisance . . . " and they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the bench talkin' about crime, mother-stabbin', father-rapin', . . . all kinds of groovy things that we was talkin' about on the bench, and everything was fine.
without his clothes? smoky bear the bare smoking smoking bear, bare
by a separate statute that has nothing to do with copyright, and everything to do with smokey the bear. you can "infringe" on the "copyright" and, instead of getting sued you just get fined $250 or spend six months in jail.
kid, i want you to go and sit down on that bench that says 'group w'
if dead and cooked by smoking it, it would be smoky bear the smoked, bare smoking smoking bear, bare
god bless america! todays quote: "it doesn't make sense but it doesn't matter because you don't either. only our needs for money and our freedoms above you. got a problem? go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200."
smokey "the just smokey bear, don't call me "smokey the bear"" bear.
honestly i don't see nothing wrong with this law: the money made with the bear go to fire prevention, what's so bad about that?
or just don't use smokey the bear on something if you don't want to pay for it?
don't worry, bike guy was training for a triathlon anyways.
every time i see a fully clothed person fall into water, i can only think about their phone.
his only mistake was letting go of the umbrella. could've mary poppins the shit out of that.
i'd bet that skateboard wouldn't even have made it over that ledge. makes it very /r/bettereveryloop.
ironic. he could save others from water... but not himself.
i don't want to be that guy, but his awkward movement and the way his path keeps track with the board make it look staged.
plot twist - biker is just commuting to work, had no idea or intention of saving the skateboard.
who skates in wet? it smokes bearings in no time.
he is just testing a new transition technique; this one is much faster than dismounting and dipping your toes to see how chilly the water is.
i can remember the summer where pushing people into the pool died.
aren't most of the smartphones these days somewhat waterproof?
i would argue his only mistake was not letting the umbrella go sooner to have more control of the bike. but then again, we wouldn't have this wonder gif to laugh at.
honestly after watching a few times i don't think he even saw it and the board knocked him of his bike unexpectedly.
it had barely any velocity left when the biker fell over it.
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth umbrella the damp?
i accept that it is staged. it's still fun to watch, tho. does that make me a bad person?
am i in the minority here to think that it's not? just looks to me like the guy didn't see the skateboard...
the umbrella really is the mvp in this gif, wouldn't be /r/bettereveryloop material without it.
now it's restrain them and force them to give up their phone before launching them into the water
it might have been both. mischief = courting behavior for a lot of guys.
could have been a new porn category - my brothers hot friend
most of the new ones are, but a lot of us still have older, non water proof ones.
his dedication is second to none. i just can't help but wonder, is he a friend of fail skater or is he just some random hero on a pushie?
definitely looks like he forced the fall on a simple trick.
it looks too perfect it must be staged. but then again, that stunt could go wrong in so many ways.
he did a little bunny hop with his bike onto the skate board to stop it.
but he had already committed to the save and wanted to avoid looking foolish at all cost.
how does this find its way into every single fucking post
yea they embraced the setup too, the way the camera anticipates the cyclists entrance. didn't diminish our entertainment level though! sometimes all we ask is for a guy to be thrown in water and we're happy :)
i actually think that that would be super difficult to stage and make it look so real. i mean, just look at it properly. no sane person would attempt something like this on purpose simply because it's so fucking unsafe. dude drove over a skateboard at a ledge, almost broke his leg coming off his bike and fell into a river that might not be particularly deep. i'm all for being skeptical when it comes to videos like these, but come on...
i thought he was talking about that summer when a girl pushed her friend into a pool and paralyzed her for life.
eh, just waterboard them instead. all the summer fun of drenching your friends without fear of ruining belts, phones, wallets. good times.
i didn't know "pain" was a verb.. does that mean the sentences "my knee pains" or "my knee is paining" are correct?
ahh... memories of taking girls pens and pencils when they weren't looking.
also, the biker has to make quite an effort to dive into the water, and the cameraman would not logically follow the skateboard.
felt a little bit miffed by the time he came out of the water, i'd wager.
by looking at the guy falling off the skateboard i would definitely say it's fake.
it is staged. camera follows the skateboard perfectly, even with anticipation. the bike rider would have bumped the skateboard, but he does a slight wheely so he flips the board.
i don't know how people are missing that. i saw it on my second view. i was trying to figure out why the board kicked up if he just runs into it.. but it's because he hoped onto tail of the skateboard.
i just got owned twice in the space of about 10 seconds.
not sure what you mean "anticipates the cyclist's entrance" -- looks like the camera was just following the board. the composition of the shot does seem a little too good to be true, but sometimes weird stuff happens. without having any further evidence i'd put my money on it being real.
even with this idea you still need those though... a belt to tie them down. their wallet for their id and to get pictures of their kids and wife so you can threaten their family. and a phone to take a sweet video to reap the karma from each of their tears, their cries for help; frantic gasping and make it all worth it. i'm not seeing the savings here...
well if it's an s8, you don't even need to take it from them. those things are good in water for up to five feet for half an hour. so shallow end push.
ok, i assume that the guy in the truck did something to deserve a headbutting? and i'm curious about what it is. but i don't think it's too smart to put a video on youtube showing how you physically assaulted someone who was just yelling at you.
it's not an exact synonym to "hurt". you can use "hurt" both to say 'i'm hurting someone' and 'my knee hurts'.but "pain" can only be used in the first way, and i've only ever seen it used in present simple (we say 'the truth pains me' but not 'this thug is paining me')
this hit me right in the feels. im going over here now. im not crying, it's allergies.
can't believe we don't have a high quality gif of that yet.
i'm sure the girl would gladly jump in if it would let her take back her mistake. no one wants to hurt anyone and least of all a guy on a bike having the time of his life.
yeah, he seems to deliberately send the skateboard forward and fall back in a very controlled way. if that's fake then likely the whole thing is fake.
i did as well but i'm honestly pretty happy about it.
i don't know, man. the cyclist passes pretty close to the camera man, seems weird imo to cut it so close to the line pedestrian in the walkway. his path of choice seems kind of odd too considering he knew he was going to have to turn and he turned directly into the skateboard that was pretty easy to spot. people are dumb and shit happens but i wouldn't be surprised at all if this were staged.
it basically means water proof. galaxy s7 is water resistant for a few meters. who swims a few meters down with a phone? i've jumped off bridge and cliff jumps into water with mine and its still working fine a year later.
yeah it really depends on which phone. some are water proof up to 3 meters. iphone 7 plus here, have dropped this thing to the bottom of a pool, still works perfectly.
yea idk would need to know more of the story, like what happened before the video even starts. right now both sides look incredible bad, truck obviously, but headbutt guy because who the fuck walks up behind someone to headbutt them with a helmet, fucking hell.
just to add to this, i've never seen it used as a verb for actual physical pain. it's always in the context of emotional pain (even in this example where the word physical was used).
went to see that movie as a way of taking my mind off a death in the family... it was an... unfortunate coincidence.
"he may have been your father boy, but he wasn't your daddy."
that was the first death in the mcu that made me genuinely sad, phil not withstanding. every other death in the whole franchise is treated as a plot point or a motivating factor for other characters, save maybe quicksilver's but his didn't have any real weight to it. yandu's was actually a meaningful sacrifice and it lands with poignancy, as well as being the natural end to that story arc. also, a cat stevens song makes everything more emotional.
still in theaters, i'd give it about an hour after the blu-ray is released. that's the only movie i've seen more than once in theaters, and i'm debating going a 3rd time. chris pratt is such a good actor.
i don't think the guy with the skateboard is a girl
right? but is it weird that i watch every time as punishment?
i wish i was willing to risk my phone like that. you are a very brave soul, i salute you
until the time you jump in the water and it dies. the s7 is rated ip68 (which is like 1 meter deep for 30 mins or something). basically, you're better off thinking about it in terms of probability. it'll *probably* be fine at even slightly lower depths than rated, for slightly longer times than they say, but personally i wouldn't gamble a phone that price on a "probably".
no phones are rated as water proof. they're usually rated as ip6x which are varying degrees of water resistance. and they're never advertised as water proof for warranty reasons.
vaguely relevant: my dad was diagnosed with the bad kind of cancer just before the 1st hobbit film came out. he had a lot of things he wanted to do but he said to me he wanted to see the whole trilogy - we loved going to the lotr films together. i know the hobbit didn't hold a candle to the first three but nevertheless. he didn't quite make it to the third film and watching it without him was tough and special at the same time. i feel closest to him when i see films or tv programmes that i know he would have loved to talk about with me. gotg 1 and 2 both fell squarely in this category, he would have loved them.
i did the exact same thing with my mom and brother after my grandpa's funeral on mom's side. the funeral at the end killed me.
aw i do this too. when the force awakens came out i was thinking about how excited dad would have been, and how we would talk about the really big thing that happened. and when i see a pretty sunrise i think about how he would have loved it too.
if you wring me out, i will become more wrinkly than you can possibly imagine.
join me and together we will rule the swimming pool as father and son!
if questioned about my ties to russia, i'll take the fifth...of vodka.
in mother russia nothing in this world can said to be certain except death, taxes, and vodka.
i had no idea what a moscow mule was a few weeks ago, until i walked into a bar and saw people drinking out of a copper cup. i asked what it was and decided to give one a try. i have to say, that's one tasty adult beverage.
honestly i laughed, but imo it's always a risky move to make a political statement like that. you risk alienating a large portion of your audience. if it was already a niche product that you know only conservatives or liberals are gonna buy like bibles or almond butter or something that's one thing, but vodka seems pretty universal.
i used to drink smirnoff. i still do, but i used to too.
i see this picture being posted on facebook. the first comment will be, "never buying smirnoff again! tired of these liberal hypocrites. *something about obama* "
didn't trump say he'd be happy to talk about it under oath too?
not trying to be the reddit dick but has anyone verified the truthfulness of this ad. i could totally imagine it being a fake l33t interweb pixturez.
i don't really drink alcohol that much anymore. is smirnoff any good?
(*crosses fingers*) please be real and not photoshop
"you just lost a customer!! stay out of politics idiots!" - 50 year old bald white guy with jorts
today at r/pics: an ad. it's literally just an ad.
guess we're just not doing the u.s. politics tags anymore?
"why does everything have to be political?" - trump supporters
mr. /u/speaklikeachild04, are you in bed with russia? the people needs to know.
is it just me or is moscow mule trending like crazy right now? i went from never seeing it on a menu to seeing it featured everywhere in the past year.
vodka was once banned in russia, it made tax uncertain and death much more certain
try a gin and tonic wiht lime. moscow mule is a sign of russian hacking the alcohol supply of usa.
it's likely in a predominantly liberal city, like new york or san francisco.
but the ad can be read both ways, as pro- or anti-trump. after all, he said he was willing to testify under oath, right?
at this point smirnoff is such staple at bars and clubs, often being used as a well/house/call vodka, that it's not going anywhere.
i think they can hold up against whatever minor backlash this might create. there are fewer and fewer die-hard supporters that would care enough to boycott them over this. also alcohol is one of those products where the principal of whatever theyre boycotting isn't going to hold up for long against the underlying need for it. speaking from experience, on a bad enough day i'm not going to let a political squabble get between me and my favorite brand. not to mention they'll pick up enough new customers to offset any losses, especially considering how overwhelmingly disliked trump is in most of the world.
conservative republican here... this is timely, hilarious and well done.
trump has a low approval rating. more americans dislike him than like him. thus, bashing him is the mainstream line.
if i really like a product and their price is reasonable, i'm gonna keep buying it. i don't care if you think the earth is flat or my mother is a whore; just give me a good product that is reasonably priced.
i'm pretty sure people from both parties buy bibles
i can see this ad being interpreted two ways, depending on how someone wants to see it. it could be seen as mocking (as i see it), but i can imagine some (those who even trump supporters would call "fanatics") could interpret it as a message of solidarity and support. still a definite risk. i'd guess smirnoff has some research and demographic data that we don't and determined it is a risk worth taking.
ah yes, surely they'll suffer the unspeakable devastation target and starbucks endured.
it's already happening in this thread lol. the irony of them being so triggered...
trump says a lot of things. at this point i can only believe what he actually does, nothing he says is reliable on any level.
he also threatened comey with tapes...after bitching and accusing obama of recording him without his knowledge. anybody hear any tapes? am i late to the party?
yep just like he's gonna build that wall any day now
what's your point? he *must* be telling the truth right?
the result of being told to keep it to ourselves for generations and generations. it's bubbled over and everyone is polarized as fuck. this is what you get when you tell people discussing important shit is rude or improper.
are you missing the entire political context of today that makes this ad interesting, or are you just trying to be dense?
balls to make fun of trump? its like the most popular low hanging fruit there is.
you know the song by phil collins "in the air of the night" about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
bartender here. can confirm. in the past 2 years my bar went from having maybe 6 mugs at one time to over 50, and we're still always running out. on busy nights. considering copper isnt cheap (and customers seem to think the mugs look sooo nice in their jacket pockets walking out the door) speaks to what kind of return these things are giving in.
yup. whoever makes the damn tins must be having a field day.
people don't know what these are? i lead a very privileged life.
anyone know why it's commonly served in a copper cup?
yeah, but now it's on reddit. i'm sure that someone at r/the_donald is working on a boycott petition as we speak.
sort of, except that he says there are no ties, and they want to make clear that they have a connection to the vodka motherland.
just like he was willing to release his tax returns when he became president.
pro trumpers gives off the vibe that they are more beer drinkers anyways
whatever boycott results from this will end sometime this thursday night, when college kids will realize that no amount of righteous indignation makes popov or 5 o'clock a good substitute for the noff.
really this ad is safe. anyone who is an extreme trump supporter might get mad or even boycott it, but there are very few trump supporters who would even care and will forget about it. on the other side you have many, many people who hate trump and will buy this by the barrels and show this ad to all their friends. and now the ad is popular online where most of the audience is young and liberal. they knew what they were doing.
lol i love how you're more willing to accept the idea of a liberal buying a bible than you are of a conservative buying almond butter.
i hear hamilton still hasn't recovered from that conservative boycott
difference between making fun of him and have a photo shoot with his severed head.
the general public is finally realizing what general contractors in nyc have known for 40 years.
i think it shows just how much reddit can be played.
you know that scene where indiana jones shoots the swordsman? harrison ford couldn't do the fight scene in the script because he had dysentery and they could only film for ten minutes at a time, so they just had indy shoot the swordsman instead.
every bar i've been to that i ordered one requires an id/credit card to be left with the bartender in exchange for the cup. i think it's a fair practice, they're pricey.
a lot of places are adding deposits if they use the full copper mugs to discourage that.
you just need to get a little more cozy with your smirnoff rep. we were getting them by the case for almost nothing at the restaurant i worked at. it helped that, as a company, we were ordering *at least* 500 cups per week (30 locations) and selling a good 2-300 moscow mules per location per week. it was fucked. we couldn't keep ginger beer in stock. literally bought out all the stock in calgary at one point and had to start getting it shipped in from other provinces.
i saw someone start to walk out with one of those mugs. i said "are you stealing that?" and they looked at me surprised/pissed/defensive that someone would actually call them on their bullshit behavior and said "what are you going to tell on me?" (exactly the maturity level i expected) and i said "no, i'm just asking you a question" and they proceeded to try and justify it by saying they were a frequent customer there, and so they "owed" it to them somehow because of the money they had spent.
don't forget to get the all copper ones for maximum chilling effect. the cheap ones are just copper plated on the outside.
some pr folks for one of the vodka companies is definitely behind it, but year theyre the *in* drink right now but probably on the end of their popularity thing. based on when i was in london a few months ago, i'd put my money on negronis (gin drinks in general) being the next big thing in us, you can already see the start of it a bit.
i don't drink clear liquor (anymore) but the ginger/lime thing works better with the flavor notes of bourbon.
everywhere on the predominantly liberal website, reddit.
one of the few broad sweeping generalizations that seems globally applicable is that you'll find higher rates of progressives in cities and conservatism in rural areas. im no sociologist or psychologist, but i bet the higher population density and exposure to different walks of life in urban areas conditions the average human to get along and deal with differences in a non-confrontational manner.
and so did comey. actually comey said that trump said that if any of his associates had ties, he wanted to know. so. russia?
and melania was going to have a press conference to talk about her immigration status, or he was going to put his money in a "blind trust", or he had a a secret plan to wipe out isis, and so on and so on. *i accidentally left off my favorite. his private investigators "cannot believe what they're finding" about obama's birth certificate in hawaii. what did they find donald?
that's because he didn't have much in new york to begin with.
genuinely curious here because i wasn't that tuned into it when it all happened, but where was the joke with that photoshoot? i remember her saying (and justifying it) that it was all just part of comedy and pushing the line is what comedians do, but... where was the joke? i haven't been able to find anyone say what it was.
which is funny, because, "at this point i can only believe what he actually does, nothing he says is reliable on any level." is usually a statement best applied to general contractors
wanna see me stick two 9 inch nails, through each one of my eye lids?
oh like clue ok. mr orange in the oval office with the pen. now someone check the secret documents and see if i'm right.
~13 on amazon. i'm sure a business can find them cheaper. still expensive as hell for a drink vessel.
we hold onto ids and "say" we will charge if they go missing. in the craziness of the busiest nights it's sometimes hard to keep track of, however. customers will sometimes return other people's mugs which can make some claim a server bussed theirs and didn't return their id... etc. normally it's easy to tell when people are lying, but customer satisfaction yada yada...
this was almost certainly made with the desire to have it go viral. most likely seeded social media themselves, too. this is, after all, a giant ad for smirnoff on the front page of reddit. as far as losing market share, i suspect they are aware the risks and underwent some market research. somehow, i doubt sales of smirnoff in poor, rural areas is the same as more 'liberal' urban centers.
is someone going to provide the exact position within the station, or are we all just going to left wondering?
also, life in cities is constantly changing. life in rural areas mostly stays the same, and when it doesn't it's often bad, like the loss of mining jobs.
ha, coke and pepsi are on there. what are they going to drink now?
if you consider that trump thought obama was from kenya (which i might add doesn't matter, as his mother is american), then any evidence otherwise would be "unbelievable" to him.
no joke. unless you count a death threat to the president a joke.
it's been six months and still no word. i don't deserve it?
i'm sorry. the answer was mr. putin in the garage with the computer virus.
yeah that's a tough situation. i would probably never come back if i had to deal with the bartender not believing me that i didn't steal a cup
having lived in la and oklahoma, i can tell you for certain, people drink more in oklahoma then la.
yes, it's just the trump-conservatives are often louder.
he has stated that he buys his suits off the rack because tailoring is a waste of time.
i literally had a trump supporter try to tell me that his mother being american didn't matter and that he had to be born on us soil to be president. this just tells you the kind of cognitive dissonance you're dealing with in that crowd.
i know you got the last two letters, i wrote the addresses on them perfect!
i just checked and it's in the metro. thank me later.
do many stations look the same? because i think i recognise it from some tv series, and i've never been to the us in my life.
hey, our smart, socially incompetent basement-dwellers can go toe to toe with 4chan anytime!
now it's too late, i'm on a thousand downers now, i'm drowsy
so this is my cassette i'm sending you, i hope you hear it i'm in the car right now, i'm doing 90 on the freeway!
and all i ever wanted was a lousy letter or a call. i hope you know i ripped *all* your pictures off the wall!
thousand valiums if you knew the kid who had a cool older brother that bought the explicit version
rap-wise it isn't his most technically impressive but it's still one of my favorites.
i used to get on at the same bus stop and ride the same bus with her every morning in seattle. her owner hated all of the publicity she gets but he understood. she would sometimes get on the bus without him paying attention then she would get off at the dog park and he would meet her there. very cool dog
that's what eclipse wants you to think. she's actually cashing social security checks for her owner, who is buried in the backyard.
wow, it took me at least eighteen years to get my act together as much as this dog right here.
making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof i'm a dog with a buspass
good for her. i always feel bad for pets that are stuck at home alone all day while their owners are at work.
and i know fucking 20 year olds who can't even do their own laundry.
she's a strong independent doggo who don't need no man
let me start by saying this is awesome and i'm glad it happens. but..... how is this legal? i thought most cities have rules against unattended animals and whatnot.
very cool owner who buys her the bus pass and enables her to leave on her own!
this is in seattle? i would like to meet this dog now
i can't even begin to relate to someone who sees a dog getting on and off a bus without reacting. it shouldn't even matter how often you had seen it before.
a celebrity dog, that's so funny. like, can you just go up to him and give him belly scratches? it's not like he'd be like other celebrities and tell you to fuck off. like one time i met ian mckellen and he was so rude, he really didn't appreciate me trying to give him a belly scratch.
don't feel bad. there's a corgi that lives near me and i always get so fucking excited when i see that corgi and that corgi isn't even famous. it just has a very cute butt.
same here. i was still new to the city, probably my 4th or 5th time ever on the bus. wasn't sure what was going on at first, but google helped me.
but how does she know *when* and *where* to get off?
she can, but often one of the friends of the owner will go down and get her.
i'm having a true blue shit day and i just had the best laugh at this. many thanks.
i always feel bad for owners that are stuck at home alone all day while their pets are at the park.
yeah but like, how do i pay the rent for the house doggo is in and the food doggo eats?
all the other dogs, of course! think of it like this: when elderly and/or unemployed people want to get out of the house during the day to waste time or get away from (or deceive) their spouses, they go to the park. several such folk often play board games (like chess, checkers) together on park benches or picnic tables, returning daily to settle the previous day's score. eclipse is just a furry-person that goes to the park every day to play doggo-games with all the other furry-person regulars.
everyone knows her and they even did an article on her in the local newspaper.
her owner catch up with her according to usa today article.
seriously, this needs to be answered. i live next to a doggo park and the amount of uncollected dog waste annoys the heck outta me. consider this, if there's a hundred doggos visiting the park a day and only 2% don't get cleaned up after that's 2 turds/day or 14 turds/week. adds up fast. some of the grass will take the fertiliser but the sidewalks can be a dog-damn minefield!
if they did take her, she'd just get on a bus and go home! she's an independent lady!
yes! i am worried for this baby. maybe i shouldn't be, but i would *never* want my dog doing anything like this because i don't trust the public at all.
she's alone at the dog park. or maybe the bus back comes at a certain time and she knows which one to get on or something, ~~but dogs have no concept of time so idk how she would be trained to know which bus~~. but a dog that is that obedient is never gonna willingly stay away from home for long. they know where the pack is.
she's going to heaven anyway with all the other dogs so she doesn't care if she's bad or not. must be nice.
seattle people are precisely the kind of people who wouldn't react to a dog boarding a bus by itself. people here are just weird.
ive lives in major cities before sometimes the weird shit you see is so surreal the dog is the most normal part of your day. like when i lived in sf i saw a homeless lady with titties down to her crotch wearing an adventure time finn hat [his actual hat]. that being said ive yet ti see a dog on a bus so id be excites
well it's seattle. they had a fox that rode the train before. modest mouse did a song about it.
crows are my favorite bird. i've always wanted one. never known how to go about befriending one sadly.
go hang out at new brighton on the dock good chance you will see him there. met the dude about 3 times there and once at work..even hopped into our car and came for a drive
she stands up and walks to the door when her stop is next, i've only been on the bus when her stop is one that people get on/off at but i imagine she's known well enough that someone would pull the cord for her.
if the owner bought the dog a buss pass and cleared it with the driver i am more than certain the driver where to let the dog get off.
if you ride the bus enough you learn to recognize the area. the dog knows the area and probably the smells too. it's like riding the bus back from school as a kid. you weren't told when to get off. you just knew your stop.
my dogs know places too. drive thrus they get treats at or when we turn into my parents neighborhood.
i was thinking before that owner is lazy to do this but when i read that his friends go down to get her feels like he is sick.
yeah i don't think anyone actually read the article, the dog doesn't actually just go to the park by itself she just goes ahead of the owner.
actually dogs have a very good sense of time. my dog tells me when it's time to take my medication twice a day at the same time everyday.
what do you mean dogs have no concept of time? there are hundreds of stories of dogs going to the school gate just at the time their kid gets out, or waits expectantly at the door when it's almost time for the owner to get home, ect. they didn't define time like humans did, but they certainly know how to adapt to know our schedules and timing patterns in our society.
i feel like it's not that seattle people are weird, just that they are used to seeing weird things. perhaps that is because they are weird after all. so i went in a circle. don't judge me.
they don't talk to other people, no reason they would talk to a dog.
in the us they're protected by the migratory bird act so you can't have one as a pet, but brefriending one is fine. i think the hard part is befriending just one, especially since they're somewhat social and would spread word about a good human feeding them.
it really seems like either our pets are getting smarter or we're just noticing it more now thanks to cameras and the internet. maybe exposure to our technology/society is improving their problem solving skills? i wonder if we could breed (relatively more) intelligent dogs in a few hundred years.
same driver... every time is a long shot... either celeb status with the transit company or word of mouth by drivers
my roommate's dog knew _every single shop_ that gave him treats. it's seattle, so pretty much everywhere has a treat jar. he knows every single one in the neighborhood. if he goes in somewhere and doesn't get a treat? no problem--he'll just sit there politely with a derpy smile on his face, tail going a-mile-a-minute until he gets one.
this song was playing in a bar i was at last weekend and i've never seen so many women but also so many men get so excited and sing along. it was a thing of beauty.
that brings up more questions. why would he not just bring the dog with him if he's already going. no matter how trained the dog is, there's risk everytime the dog does this that it'll get hurt, taken, end up lost, etc.
i used to be hungry. i still am, but i used to be too.
my cat was at least as precise as an atomic clock, and had eyes in the back of her head. saved my ass from being late many a time, and occasionally astounded me with her *knowing*.
god, i wish i could afford to adopt one right now. hug your doggo for me. hug him for all of us who are in difficult situations who are unable to have a friend like yours. :(
that's awesome. but what about daylight savings time?
yeah at 6pm my dogs know its exactly time to feed them for dinner. they always get really hyper and run towards where the food is.
my dog sits in my daughter's bedroom doorway when it's her normal bedtime. if we're doing other things, she'll continue to sit there, waiting to participate in the ritual of us tucking her in. dog just knows when it's time to go to bed.
all i know is my cat consistently wakes me up 10 minutes before my alarm.
i've always wondered that. i'd love some research on it.
well this person can obviously spell, every word is spelled correctly, however he evidently used the wrong words.
fact! as someone raised in the south it drives me nuts.
there's a murder on my street, but i only want one friend. not a gaggle in which the neighbors start giving me looks.
you obviously are very superior to me in googling skills.
good idea, breed more intelligent versions of animals, that always works out well in the movies.
are you saying she should be sitting in the back of the bus?
my cat wakes me up at the same time every day. it's weird. he just knows. it's not even a bad time it's 9:20 i'm just lazy as fuck and roll into work at 10 or really want to sleep in on weekends...
my cat used to jump on my chest every morning i overslept, was never late to school. great cat, it even wasn't like, "hey, time for food" i fed her at night before i slept.
hey man, whatever you're going through just know you can make it, and you will make it. if you need someone to talk to i'm here for you
if you live in a place that allows pets, you can foster! if you don't live in a place that allows pets, you can volunteer at a shelter! i don't know your living situation, so neither of those may be possible for you. but there are usually options and opportunities.
i don't think the intervals at which you take medication is changed by daylight savings time bro
that must be a great way of getting the child to bed. "look, the dog says it's bed time."
my mom gets home around 525 every evening. my dog starts flipping out and pacing near the door starting at 515. we've even seen him do it in our security cams when we aren't home.
when i started working from home, my cat would flip out if i didn't break for lunch and feed him at the usual time. he's also a fatty.
can speak from personal experience - if you feed your dog at the same time every day they'll pick up on that and remember, and they won't let you forget it either.
i saw a documentary on netflix and a researcher had a hypothesis that dogs can sense time through smell.
yeah try that line of defense at a spelling bee, f lee bailey. see how far that gets you.
i'm going to seattle next month from texas. i just added scratching eclipse on the head, and getting a picture to the things to do while in town list! no bullshit, i'm actually making it my number one priority and even more excited to go because of this post.
just never come to austria mate. random smalltalk with strangers just doesn't exist here. i mean, if you need directions or something, everyone will happily help you but don't try to chat about the weather after we told you where to go.
as a midwesterner, i thought rural texas was great. in the cities, it seemed like people were still a bit aloof.
all its takes in 1 really well disciplined dog as the pack leader dogs are hella resourceful they know whats up
i totally believe that. the stray dogs i've seen in foreign countries (i'm from us) are really smart and resourceful, and quite chill.
she's usually only gone for a few hours, but it always seems like days to him.
if i go visit oregon, to see its beauty, how can i make nice with the locals? i live in ca, but i was born and raised in detroit. should i just say im from detroit?
i cant even squat without my knees wanting to give out.
we have that same internal clock, we're just more out of touch with it. my flatmate's cat knows exactly what time it is, and that he gets fed at 7am every day, and he still wakes us up at freaking 5:30am and pats us (with a paw) and meows for pets and food for the next one and a half hours, arrrghhh.
lucky. my cat licks my face every morning at 6:30 am. what sucks is i'm a diabetic, so on bad mornings i'm particularly cranky, but he persists. he's the best.
jesus christ i honestly wasn't expecting this. now i'm in a puddle of tears. thank you for the kind word stranger. i've been under pressure for some time and your single comment broke that. thank you again. :')
i actually said to her last night, "look, the dog is waiting for you to come to bed. she wants to help tuck you in."
i wake up at 5 am during the week for work. my dog comes and wakes me up at 445am. every. single. fucking. day. even on sundays and mondays (my off days)
don't forget to add "post on reddit to get sweet sweet karma" to the list.
sounds like i need to move austria. as an american in a very friendly town, i dread going anywhere because people do this shit all the time. i just want to go places without having to talk to anyone!
lol thank you guys for this. was feeling down about my mom being sick and coming to reddit always makes me laugh & smile again
yepp, our cats, 0515, on the dot, every morning "hello humanz! time fer breakfast!!!". if you ignore them they lick our toes.. :o
glad my comment could help you feel a little better :) really, if you need to talk about anything just pm me
our dog is the exact same. my wife wakes up at 7:30am every day, even on the weekends (my wife is an early person, i hate her). some times if my wife stays up late and sleeps in, right at 7:35-7:40, our dog is booping her with her wet nose to wake her up. after six years my wife has learned to just accept that she wont be able to sleep past 8:00am for a while. if we close the door, she will sit outside and wimper, so we cant just lock her out. on extreme days, my wife will take her out, feed her, and just go back to bed, and then she lays on the floor till we are up and about. generally my wife can't fall back asleep so will get up after half an hour and go about her day.
used to have a cat that did that, man would piss me off! but, how mad can i really get at a fricking cat. vicious cycle.
i think that's just what old ladies do. i usually have a little chat with them, i know the elderly can be lonely.
austria, not australia. arnold schwarzenegger, not croc dundee
i'm obligated to not say out of fear of being put on any lists.
i'm sorry about your mother man, wishing the best.
is this a galaxy note joke or are you going to hurt people?
cause you know i'd sniff a thousand butts just to hump you... tomorrow. tonight.
this company not only understands dogs but also gave the value of two toys in one.
what's in the sad cactus, though? i have to know.
this is fantastic! was the toy marketed this way, or was it a surprise?
it's cool when they do stuff like this. costco used to sell some that were like 4 legged animal toys, and inside the "feet" were tennis balls.
did you get this from barkbox? because my roomie's dog got this exact toy in a barkbox and 25 min later, this sad cactus emerged. the flower and one arm of the cactus were pooped out a couple days later...
the cynical side of me is telling me this is vital marketing and that someone making minimum wage had to chew it it to make it look authentic.
that subs gotten a lot of mentions today. hold my cherry- limeade.
i don't understand the subs title, but i definitely threw a subscribe on it.
yeah bark box does this stuff!! my dog has a toy where it has a ball inside. i think they call them like tuff toys or something of the sort for the purpose of dogs who rips stuff up! i love their stuff!
apparently not! i just posted it there and it got downvoted to oblivion haha
you're not alone... getting bombarded by pms from people accusing me of being a shill. rest assured it's just me and one crazy 8 month old golden retriever.
somehow the manufacturer knew. they knew the pet would chew their happy toy up. getting a sad cactus indicates its time to buy a new toy because nobody wants a sad cactus. genius.
that makes it so much better. any idea who the manufacturer is? i can think of a few wild pups who would appreciate this...
don't worry about it. people accuse pretty much anything that has something corporate in it of being evidence of "corporate shills" on this site. it's total paranoia. i posted a picture on my old account that had some fast food in it and was accused of working for their marketing department.
why is bark box not on amazon. how do i buy it if it is not on amazon.
is there some sort of barkbox for cats? a meowbox if you will.
/r/mildlyhailcorporate we had pup and bark box until recently. they did have some cool stuff. i wish manufacturers would stop filling the toys with fluff though. the dogs don't care if it's filled or not. we got one squeak toy in a box that had an ultrasonic squeaker so only dogs could hear it. that was the best thing ever, they'd bite on it and you'd just hear the little pfft like a snipers fart.
now the question is what is inside that one?
my dog was squeaking on one of those blue spiky balls as i read this. i got like half a dozen for $5 at a local pet store. they hold up well. i don't think they've destroyed one yet.
i'm guessing you didn't title it "me irl", because those guys will upvote anything. heck, someone could screenshot this comment and get upvotes.
the only thing that irks me, is that the description in their website explains the toy has two layers.
brb starting new business nesting doll dog toys with a 25% coupon at the center
this has become fairly common. i see dog chew toys that have little ropes inside them so the dogs can pull the "guts" out after they've chewed a hole in the toy. dogs love them.
"wrapped in two layers of fabric, your pup can rip off the smiley face to reveal the same cactus but with a frowny face." right in the description on their website.
i mean, if they just wanted people to buy another toy they could just put nothing in there. getting nothing indicates it's time to buy a new toy because no one wants a broken toy. adding the sad cactus just makes the toy better
no clue but i'm tempted to tweet this at bark box and find out! they also had a toy tennis bag with 2 real tennis balls inside one month.
one of the top posts on /r/hailcorporate is about me because they thought i was a mcdonalds corporate shill after i did a pretty long analysis of the way a higher minimum wage could affect the fast food industry. didn't seem to matter that a good part of the post was shitting on mcdonalds food and business model. i come from a business analytics background so was pretty straightforward with publicly available info...but reddit assumes pretty much any time any brand is mentioned you must be working for them. to be fair i know for a fact brands do use reddit to advertise, but it's usually pretty damn obvious.
just a box, literally any box, is what cat's want to play with.
great concept until your dog eats it. it changes to 10% off when it hits the colon
i have to buy toys made out of refurbished firehose for my dog, so he doesn't destroy it in less than 30 seconds lol
yeah! there could be an *even sadder cactus* inside!
well thats slightly morbid. i feel like my dogs would love it too, though.
it just comes in a box of random dog stuff, so there wasn't any explanation and i didn't bother looking it up on their site. pretty awesome though. i should check her other messed uptoys from them before i throw them out.
in my experience, many people don't read things too closely. and when it comes to the customers i deal with at work, most don't bother to read at all.
in fairness, i don't hold it against op that s/he did not carefully read all the fine print associated with this dog toy purchase.
barkbox have had a string of toys recently that i feel bad about giving to my dog. they are too cute. my dogs shreds them while they smile and it's hard.
oohhhhh... i got the tennis ball one, and i totally did not get that the point was to rip up the bag. my dog wasn't too excited about it, so those balls probably aren't going anywhere.
will you report back if your dog gets through the sad cactus to see if there is yet another layer beneath?
yep! if you send a picture of your dog and the destroyed toy, you get credits for more toys :) it's pretty awesome!
...then as soon as you call them out, they just say some bullshit about how the sub is just about how a post *could* be marketing. i don't understand the point of spamming the link everywhere. if the problem is being annoyed by the ads, being annoyed by the links doesn't make it better.
that is the beauty in all of this. the company is counting on the dog to eat it. owner buys toy thinking they will get a coupon, dog eats coupon, owner buys new toy at 100% cost thinking this time they will get the coupon in time!
that's what my dog needs... you would be amazed at what damage a 10lb weiner can do! my house looks like a crime scene. #deathtoallstuffies
*sad* cactus. *sadder* cactus. *saddest* cactus. but then? what then? **what then???!??**
my dog got a super huge chew toy in the shape of a money bag last month. discovered cute little plush gold coins in it while playing. they have attention for detail.
terms and conditions that may affect my life until my deathbed? ain't nobody got time for that! *clicks "accept"*
if your dog shreds toys there's a heavy chewer options you can try too! but i know some dogs love tearing apart toys while we watch lol
a dog lawyer or a shit lawyer? because i recommend you hire both, or keep one on retrainer.
it'll probably be another few weeks before she destroys this one. i think it's just the squeaky thing in there though.
my dog recently caught a rabbit while we were walking. i made her drop it and i don't know if it survived but its scream was very familiar.
my dog got the cowboy hat. the tag on it read "for pet play and prairie justice only." cracked me up.
my dog prefers shredding. i've tried toys meant for heavy chewing and she doesn't care for them. she wants to destroy.
retain shit. fire the dog. hit the lawyer. got it.
i'm highly qualified in bird law, but i could probably venture over to the spectrum of animal law.
you really can't, and i'm not saying i agree with it. it's just that dog law in this country, it's not governed by reason.
my spaniel is like a surgeon for the squeaky parts. gets them out no problem from these ducks we get.
and i bet you think its cute when your dog shakes its head real quick with the toy in its mouth. yeah think about that one for a second too...
i have a crow issue. do you specialize in crow cases?
show us the happy cactus, sad one, and cactus ball from inside.
same goes with cats :d they're trying to "break its neck"
what about the xbox one x in one xbox one x box lmao
no longer convinced the word 'one' could be possibly spelled like that. what?
if they really want to fuck with sony they should just name it xbox 6
xbox box by dr seuss xbox socks box knox knox in box. xbox in socks. knox on fox in socks in box. socks on knox and knox in box. xbox in socks on box on knox. $500
how many xbox one x's would one xbox one x box if one xbox one x could box?
it's like when goku tried to explain super saiyan blue to frieza
you can tell they took xbone pretty hard, xbox one x, from x.b.one to x.b.o.x now.
say whatever you want about microsoft's gaming department, their naming sense is the worst in the whole business.
looked at that picture for too long and now the word "one" looks weird to me.
they should have just kept the name scorpio. it would be better then this xbox one x shit.
i dont even get it. is this x box one x a new system, like ps1 to ps2? or is it a variant to xbone, like the the xbox 360 and the 360s (or whatever the smaller one was)
agree. surely, they will do something to filter out the frauds, right?
xbox one x box price: $345 condition: almost new time left 1h 34m bids: 23 bidders: 2 seller note: almost new, opened just one, manual included bonus: gold plated hdmi cable
you should be able to get a full refund if the seller does not describe the item they are selling accurately.
that was an interesting sub: *vanilla ice sampled david bowie and queen on "ice ice baby". if he sampled them for an entire album, it would be a...* *bohemian rhapsody bowie mean rap cd*
i so want to come up with one of these but i'm nowhere near smart enough.
i started to second guess how "one" was spelled. it just doesn't look right anymore.
it kind of isnt. just some name that a marketing team thought would be totez rad to the kids. xbox altogether has good attributes, but i hate their styling and marketing. it's like if you pour mountain dew gamer fuel edition, some doritos, a graphic tee /blazer combo, and a headset into a pot and molded a machine.
after reading this and reading the op i can confidently say i had a momentary freak out over how weird the word "one" looked.
xbox one x in one xbox one x box in another xbox one xbox
i am going to buy them all so i can shove them in my ass and pretend to be the world's first legitimate pregnant man oh, that's not what you meant lol
you know why it's called the xbox 360? cause you turn 360 degrees and just walk away.
thank you i was really hoping i wasnt alone in feeling like i don't recognize the word 'one'.
and follow up with an xbox 6s, then an xbox 6s plus.
it wouldn't really be any different then going straight from windows 8 to windows 10.
of course not. it comes with a penpineappleappleapplepen.
i'm sure it's already in production or about to begin. i was *really* hoping for scorpio! but yeah, it is a terrible name and is going to confuse the shit out of people around the holidays.
they were convinced everyone was going to call it "the one" because they were totally full of themselves. people will still call it the xbone, or the catching xxxbonexxx
but then people would think its a new console rather than a hardware update on existing one
our only hope is good feedback and ebay buyer protection. fraudsters bout to have a field day with this
i don't think you can do that anymore, there is buyer protection. funny, but i actually used to sell my company's old ipad boxes. i would put them up for about 30 bucks, and sure enough, they would get purchased. one person actually contacted me and asked me to ship it all the way to him in norway. no idea why people wanted these items. but the point of my story was, i would get all these "questions" and item feedback, that my listing was "typical scammer!!!, buyer beware, not a real ipad. but i clearly wrote everywhere already that i was selling the box. i guess people just heard stories from the media a while back and think this is continuously a thing.
if the seller accurately describes it as a box, including pictures of an empty box, and states multiple times in the description that there is only a box, with nothing inside it, and someone buys it thinking they're buying an xbox, when they're really just buying one xbox one x box, will the buyer still get a full refund or can i still take his money?
if you enjoyed that, be sure to check out the post that won the subreddit. the legendary condescending condor sending con...
trending subs are subpar; some are. get ready to be flooded with terrible content like this, /r/wordavalanches! i'm so sorry.
til there's a phrase for this. i've tried to describe this to other people and not everyone understands what i'm talking about.
i wonder if you can fit an xbox one x in one xbox box
you gained 13 karma for this, but cost others far more karma. this should serve as a lesson. only reply if you can add relevant information. understanding of angles isn't relevant information.
they could follow the *final fantasy* numbering system and announce the *xbox one x-2* or follow nintendo with the *new xbox one x.*
nah windows actually had a logical reason for doing that
500 bucks? or bux for box? xbox for bux or bucks for box.
scorpio is cool but it's too confusing, people won't realize it's the same console "generation"
source for that claim? sounds like you just made it up for a laugh.
it just took me 5 minutes to read that out loud to my wife. beautiful.
thanks for this. never knew the term, but have definitely experienced it a few times.
if so, do you think you could also fit one xbox one x box inside of the xbox one box so that you have an xbox one x box in an xbox one box that contains and xbox one x with no box?
this has happened many times already. time is circular. everything we know is wrong.
it only took me 2 minutes to read it to her. what am i doing wrong?
that's okay. that particular avalanche isn't quite.... fluid. it works grammatically and for the language, but there really isn't any story or point to it that wasn't hard to reach for. i personally like mine better, in regards to the ark not having any cocaine or precipitation. noah's nose knows no snow
/u/xxx420pussyslayerxxx of course that's a username.
time is a spiral. it's a circle moving forward in space, like a slinky.
basically using words that together sound like nonsense, but are grammatically correct.
it isn't very classy to toot your own horn like that.
why didn't they just name it the xbox 720 and just move on?
time is a double helix of significant events captured on the strands of good and evil.

because marketing. we're talking about it, so it's working
i had never seen the buffalo one explained like this comment, so i went and read the wikipedia explanation. i came away from it questioning that buffalo was even a real word.
i can give credit where it's due though. the fact that x-box one x abbreviates to xbox is pretty damn clever, if a little confusing.
microsoft was annoyed that people didn't call the xbox one the "the one", instead it was known as the xbone. the problem is that now they have the xbox one x, the 'triple xbox', or 'xxx box'. the sexbox, for short.
that baby is just asserting its dominance. by the look on dad's face, it's working.
you got tea bagged... in real life... by your kid?
at least there wasn't crap coming out the sides of the diaper, splattering it all over your face.
that kid's gonna grow up to become a wwe superstar and this will be his finishing move.
i'm a teacher. the wife works a normal job. we have a 1.5 and a 3.5 year old. i have more control over 28 middle schoolers in a classroom than i do over these 2. it's week 2 of the summer, i may not live until the end of it.
"and after this i'm gonna suck on your wife's titty" - that kid probably
fellow father here of a 3yr old boy. gotta give you props on the solid diaper change. no protruding ass cheeks and is able to withstand a solid amount of violent movements. well done.
why do kids do this?!?! i lay on the floor to play with my son...i assume hes going to get a toy or a drink or something...seconds later its like mortal kombat "finish him" and out of nowhere...baby ass..in the face. little bugger. lol
wow op you could be my husband's twin brother. i had to look at the gif for a minute to convince myself you are in fact a different person. i showed my husband and he says "holy shit i have a twin!" are you aware of any missing family? (i'm half kidding, but dh was adopted...)
my niece used to do this and we'd call it the stripper dance. now she's older and randomly does this off-brand twerk and we're trying to figure out who taught her.
more proof not having kids was the right choice for me
i'm in my early 20's and there's times where i would really like to have a child of my own.. then i see shit like this.
i assume you're joking, but actually it's true. which is why dad should not let baby do that.
difference is the victim in this situation is actually going to fuck his mom.
looked a bit brown. little fellow was probably shitting as he smashed dad's face.
you can only love them for so long. can't believe you lasted this long tbh.
"and i fuck your mom. whenever you shut up long enough that is" *face sitting intensifies*
the kid wants attention. dad is busy with his phone
i showed my wife this gif, and she asked me when i took that video. we have 2 about that age, and two just a bit older, and she thought it was me. maybe i'm your husband's twin brother.
kids naturally twerk. it's like the most basic dance move
god i love being gay i'm not getting anyone pregnant!
i'm also in my early 20s and have a 6 month old. i've gotten baby shit on my fingers and a tiny bit on my face less than an hour ago, by the way. unless you are an extremely calm and patient person after several months of sleep deprivation, i suggest against it.
i swear your and my kid share the same league. except my 2 sons do a doubleteam stomp on face and balls. they apparently want no more brothers.
"i demand answers. where did you learn to tea bag like such a boss?!" "you alright?! i learned it by watching you!" *this message is sponsored by the church of latter day saints. stop the cycle of pwnage. teach your kids that they don't need to go so hard.*
what is your opinion on the new hcs weapon and radar settings in halo 5?
then 1.5 years later, he gets teabagged by 2 toddlers
what exactly were you hoping to see after that, i'm curious... ?
nah, clean diaper. that line goes blue when it's wet.
fixed the typo and i love my kids more than life itself. so much that when i was reading them "daddy is my hero" today i got tears in my eyes. i could just feel that they related to it and i could never imagine not being their hero! of course the relationship is different with my students. i am the "mean" teacher on our team and they respect me for it. they may not like me for a while but in the end they appreciate that i hold them accountable and it gets results. the saying often goes, "don't smile until december." i don't smile until final exams are over. it is the only way to keep discipline distractions to a bare minimum. when my kids destroy the county average then they realize that's what it takes to be successful. when my students have their own children and those children get to 8th grade, i hope they think "i want jonny to have mr. worm30478" because he will keep them in line and make sure they learn. that is what i truly care about as a teacher.
i made your wife defecate on a table in front of 6 nurses and a doctor! spread. eagle.
well.. i dont have a working cell phone..whats the next reason
any idiot with enough spotting bonuses could reach c100
it would be nice for my husband to find his family, he looks nothing like his adopted family (parents have 4 bio kids) and sometimes he says he would just like to see who it is he looks like.
i completely agree with people having the right to choose not to have kids and not be given shit for it, but that sub is toxic as hell
so, how are those tps reports coming? did you remember to include a coversheet?
i have 2 sons and a daughter (4y/o boy, 3y/o boy, 18months girl) that attack me daily like this. their favorite is to jump on my chest and crotch. especially when it's all 3 kids together.
yeah, pretty sure this is some hardwired shit kids do to make sure there's no other mouths to feed but their own. and the jumping in bed thing or the "dad, i'm thirsty" thing. kids are savage and will kill the diddle by any means necessary.
no. not everything that looks like an animalistic dominance display is an animalistic dominance display. this baby is doing what all babies do, exercising muscle groups to figure out what they do, how to gain control over them and test their interaction with the world. the baby is looking at a spot on the couch, flexing their legs and looking at how the spot moves up and down in their vision. they are mapping that to figure out how their body works in space and how their muscles work their body. the baby in this gif has no memory that dad is there and no third-party perspective that shows them that their ass is hitting dad's face. they know what they see in front of them and not much else. it's why they think peekaboo is the most hilarious thing in the world; when you cover your face with your hands you actually disappear to them. think they have any idea what's going on behind them? nope.
i'm not sure if he could cover that. it would just be easier for a whole lot of people to chill with that game. haha sorry i ruined it for you.
the amount of facial surface area for tea bagging will saturate. the babies might grow more numerous but their tea bagging won't scale.
**crap coming out the sides of the diaper, splattering it all over his face**
yes. anything wet changes the line from yellow to blue. source: i have a 3 month old. i've seen lots of blue lines lately.
the line can still be yellow as long as the shit is somewhat dry. source: my daughter shits dry somehow
a lot of these specific, "lifestyle" subs are pretty toxic.
god, that sub disappointed me so badly. i decided in my early teens to never have kids because of mental illness (a combination of not wanting to pass the genes for it on and not wanting to risk being a bad parent because of it). i'm still too young to responsibly have children but already catching so much shit for it. my long term relationship might come to an end over disagreeing on this. /r/childfree sounds like a great place to get support for that but from the posts i've read, half the people would consider me a zombie for still having maternal instinct and in a way definitely wanting kids. the "lifestyle" does seem to attract some selfish people who seriously lack empathy, it's a damn shame. sorry for ranting.
you ever get caught on a chokehold and wonder where the fuck did that come from? toddlers are spoopy sometimes :d love my boys a ton though, dad just needs to be fit to stay alive.
my daughter (2) aparently seen an old wrestling video and decided to try it out, i was on the ground on my back and she put out her elbow and fell on me
toooootally thought you meant you had a 4 month old and a 3 month old and i was like how the fuck does that work?
today, the boys decided to get cleaning supplies out of the bathroom and spray/dump them on the brown carpet. toilet bowl cleaner has bleach in. so now we have an orange spot.
i'm really confused why "dad i'm thirsty" is related to dick damage. i'm assuming this is a hilarious misunderstanding on my part.
woah, i thought english just wasn't your first language until i read the username
i'm not going back home but anyway she was the niece i had been on my mind and she had to do so it is not a bad thing.
while there is only so much surface area they can cover, additional siblings can cover shifts to ensure 24/7 teabagging.
the line is yellow **before** they pee in it? who designed this system?
i've done a lot of drugs and also have children. they both make me very happy in very different ways.
y'all are all young or inexperienced or both, of course kids won't sound good to you. they'll sound like a bad idea. but it's extremely fulfilling for some people. i don't want kids but i've seen how a lot of my friends and families lives have gotten so much happier after they've had babies. and all of my nieces and nephews and my godson are wonderful children. babies are hard and stressful, but parenting seems really rewarding especially if you're a good and hardworking person. also its a natural urge to procreate and have offspring. saying, "why wud people want kids they suck lol" can be simply answered by: it's nature.
we're gonna have to make you come in on saturday... uhhh ... yeah
oh boy i'm triggered. just had my two nearly three year old daughter wake up screaming, refuse to sleep and then grab my hair. boy i'm unequipped for this single parent thing. dad just wants to sleep. please. please...
i can totally relate, my two year old has been practicing jump kicks on us lately. its actually quite impressive.
make sure her form is good, she could crack a rib later on in life if she's doing it wrong
as a dad, i'll enlighten you. you're doing it with so. kid comes in and gets right in between you two. little fucker...
wow i thought you weren't green untill i read your username.
well i think it is in your country i've seen both trailers for you to get it online and then walking around a da to be fair 3 times before the wedding.
paging /r/theydidthemath we need one math man for the matrix population model and one math man for the surface area calculations. now!
holy hell, i thought your name was trevor until i read your username
i am a little confused about the hand warmers and the only dogs that i have to replace busted gas lifts are not the case of the russian.
this just in: apparently it's not possible to have fun without drugs
holy shit i didn't check my hopper until i read your username. and i'm trevor btw. weird stuff going on here.
i think the sentiment of them almost losing to trash teams in my mind and spirit, i have been involved. i am of course just a reminder that we are a lot.
but there is context, they don't want to get raped so they bring along a shit-filled baby to steep in their drinks. which part are you not understanding here? everyone does this...
holy shit i thought you supported hilary until i read your username
lol you already have a little bit of a bitch in the mouth and they forgot items for both cars in the mouth. i'm ready fool jeans off shorts on i need money too small like a degenerate art of my thumb and an index.
/r/nocontext is used to say that, out of context the comment is stranger, or funny, or weird. at least that's what i think
that's great news. props to the emts and medical staff. some real heroes at work there.
good to hear. have we heard about the manchester victims yet? last i heard there were still 10 in critical condition.
good to read. the response to the attacks by the various authorities, from what i've read at least, was excellent. definitely helped limit the number of casualties.
absolutely fantastic. the ems crews (and anyone who gave first aid) did amazing work that night.
i really hope there aren't too many disfiguring injuries amongst those.
48 victims? first time hearing this amount. damn
we're so lucky to have the nhs. fuck anyone that wants to privatise it.
well stabbings in london from gang violence isn't that uncommon. i imagine hospitals weren't too taken aback by the injuries. everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows someone, whose been stabbed in london.
great news. but what is the u.k. government doing to help prevent future attacks? are the citizens just supposed to rely on terrorists being terrible at their jobs?
how's the cop who took them on with just a nightstick?
winston churchill, while talking about the plight of the british forces in malakand (1897) he had this to say, "the profession of medicine, and surgery, must always rank as the most noble that men can adopt."
they were just doing their job. but i bet they wouldn't mind a ~~coffee~~ tea or beer ;)
weird how we don't hear much about the manchester incident though? few weeks later and it feels like it went out of the mediasphere?
as it was an explosion which had bolts and other miscellaneous items inside of it, the damage was much much more severe than a few men with knives. unfortunately having your face completely blown off, and limbs severed, takes a long time to recover from. it's far too a depressing story to report in the media, and personally i'd like to recover in peace if it were me... here's hoping to a speedy recovery to all those left in hospital.
london or manchester; none of the victims will have to create fundme-campaigns to cover their medical expenses..
closely followed by the fact that the terrorists got absolutely rinsed.
i saw somewhere that there was an initial 2 minute response time for first responders, is this accurate? pretty amazing if so
this. i hate to think that despite surviving some of these people may have to deal with disfigurement and/or disablement.
this is why, when discussing these things, i prefer to use the term *casualties* and group them together. the boston bombing "only" killed three people but it wounded over three *hundred*, and many of those injured will never have a full and complete life again. 17 of them had lost one or more limbs, and others with severe nerve, muscle and tissue damage, to say nothing of the psychological trauma. when we think "injury" we think of falling off our bikes and scraping our knees but the grim reality is wound casualties are usually literally or metaphorically half dead.
it's a misleading title. there were eight deaths as a result. i'm not sure if that makes 56 victims or if the deaths include the attackers making for 53 victims.
i will never understand why people wouldn't want national health care...
yeah, as an american my mind added "and zero of them will lose their homes and have to file for bankruptcy" to that as i read it.
are you suggesting that if this attack was in the us, not all victims would have survived?
modern medicine only works when used by skilled, hard working hospital staff and paramedics.
i wonder if they realised just how ridiculously weak and pathetic they appeared; three grown men ambushing unarmed, defenceless women while wearing blue peter arts and crafts fake bomb vests.
this needs more credit, the emergency wards that dealt with them and the paramedics are used to serious knife injuries.... we don't as a rule see gunshot wounds, stabbings and glassings are probably weekly for many casualty departments and paramedics in the major cities...
cutting policing budgets and legalising fox hunting..
now this is the kind of "news" i like to see. the news about the normal and good people who were effected (and helped the situation) and not the evil idiots who get all the attention. great work... i wish there was a website with news/information like this.
this is a great comment, but it leaves out the best part about roy larner: "fuck you, i'm millwall!" i don't follow u.k. football at all (dumb yank, here), but if i had to pick a team to follow, i'd probably start with a look at millwall, just because of roy.
there was a guy on skynews the day after the attack, explaining how he was following the attackers and throwing stuff at them. gave such a detailed explanation of where they were going and what they did - will try to find it.
don't forget roy larner's twin who did all the same stuff but gets no credit.
beat post i have read in 4 years on reddit. bravo sir. i'm off work with a slipped disc feeling a bit down in the dumps but this brightened my day, as well as reminding me that things for me ain't all that bad.
not really any new developments. would you prefer the flight mh370* style coverage? there was a memorial concert, that was covered. to come up again the police would have to release an update on the investigation which at this point is likely very classified from a standpoint of tracking down known associates and involves doing their own internal audit into "how did we miss this", which take awhile.
not just depressing, but intrusive. i would not want the world to know just how disabled and disfigured and traumatized i personally am, and have strangers making conversation about if i can survive and/or ever be a functional person.
the new government is the same as the last one -_- almost had em gone...
correct me if i am wrong, but doesn't your new government actually have more labor seats than a month ago now?
someone on my newsfeed thought privatising the nhs would actually make it better as it would put people off from going, you just couldn't make it up
if you've seen the way our va and military hospitals are run, you would understand completely.
i am american and it makes no sense to me at all. fortunately i live in a newly industrializing country with universal health care for most.
if you're not born into wealth, you've clearly done something wrong in a previous life.
yes, but it's a bit difficult when loads of them happen at one time. there are 5 major trauma centres in london, and they probably have at least 5 trauma bays each. i think the royal london will have at least 5, 12 of them were taken there, it must have been quite difficult to manage it. but they did, at the time there was 1 operating theatre open but by the time they had all 12 patients in they had 5 operating theatres open.
you have to give at least some credit to the media - there were lots of articles about the heroes (almost every link in my comment is a newspaper article). now that the attacker's names are known the attantion shifted a little though..
yeah reckon he's up there with john smeaton the glaswegian who kicked a burning terrorist in the balls
millwall fans chant 'everyone hates us, we don't care!' they are about as british as it gets, are no strangers to violence, and love britain with a passion!
pretty sure you mean gerard vowles (3rd in my list)! saw him on sky news first too. but he has since given a few different interviews, i think.
didn't find anything about him. you have a link / name?
how much damage can may now inflict in the time she has left? that is the question.
they put on a great show. amazing show of solidarity. ariana grande has been a class act throughout the whole thing.
that is fine but it is important people acknowledge the damage done to people's lives and the severity of the situation. this is not to make us live in fear of it (aka letting the terrorists win) but to makes sure everyone realises there is an evil that we need to band together to defeat and not have everyone just bury their heads in the sand because it makes us uncomfortable.
exactly. it's probably a better situation, now labour have more power in the commons to stop the conservatives from running riot.
i was arguing with a friend the other day. he thinks the nhs is in shambles because of the *immigrant crisis* and we should privatise it all to get in in order and work from there...
a friend of mine said that nationalized health care would result in longer waits. i asked him why and he said because more people would get treatment thus longer waits. i guess i just do not understand why it is a problem that more people get healthcare. some people think that health care is a luxury not a right.
i don't think anyone wants underfunded and mismanaged national healthcare any more than underfunded and mismanaged private healthcare.
the problem in the end is that there is not an overall single payer system in the states. even if medicare/medicaid/va have full coverage, the companies making equipment can still set really high prices, because even if the publicly funded hospitals don't buy it, private ones will. if you get a truly single-payer system, then suppliers are bidding for contracts for the entire system, rather than just assuming they'll get a 20% market share and call it a day. this ultimately means that the cost of healthcare is the same, just not coming out of pocket. without the rest of the system helping to reduce costs, funded hospitals have to stretch their dollar as much as possible.
lucky you man! fellow american here and can't wait till i move out of the states, partially because of healthcare
those are pretty cheap. i've been charged 90 dollars for a tyelonol
i hope to see more positive coverage like this when things go down in the usa. the way the brits handle and present terrorism news events just seems so different than here in the states.
ive always felt like they should never say the name of the perpetrators, they should just show pictures of them and refer to them as "losers or scum"
nah that's par for the course for glaswegians. (/s, that's also pretty badass).
i don't think i've heard a brit say ledge in the last 3 years. cheeky nandos is a few months dead too.
that man will never pay for a seat, a pint or a meal ever again. 'fuck you, i'm millwall!' will become the rallying cry of a beleaguered nation. he really should be knighted
if she wants the anti-abortion, anti-homosexuality, terrorist sympathising dup to prop her up, a fair amount.
what are the likely next major developments in uk politics following this vote?
how much time she has left? she isn't going to willingly resign and no one wants to be responsible for the shitshow that brexit will be. we have her for the next 5 years.
if we continued to cover terrorist attacks for weeks after they happen despite no new developments we'd just be inciting more fear, which is exactly what the terrorists want. i'd wager it would also lead to more attacks given the increased reach/attention of each event.
and when did we stop talking about flight ma 370? even though there are no new developments i need the news talking about it as much as possible. same with manchester.
the one who was stabbed got up and ran away, thankfully
they got killed in the fucking face. one had 30 bullet holes in him so the rumour goes.
and now just for my intellectual health, conservative in your sense is similar to the direction of american conservative, and labor is similar to american liberals, correct?
i work for the nhs in two london hospitals. not a single one of our consultants is white british. only one (out of about 15) was born here. without immigration the nhs would be in absolute tatters.
do you guys have fox news across the pond? that's a fox news viewer if i ever heard one.
longer waits do genuinely happen in places with universal healthcare, the thing is that if it is an emergency you can just go ahead of the line. most people go to the doctor's for small ailments or long-term problems, so the wait is inconvenient but not really that big of a deal-breaker.
yeah, in all this political discussion about who should pay for the healthcare, everyone seems to ignore the medical suppliers that absolutely extort everyone else. it's like they know they can just charge what they want because the hospitals, insurance companies and such will just raise their prices to compensate.
$200 for benadryl when i had an allergic reaction for the first time two years ago.
i was in canada when their parliament was attacked. they had a similar, understated coverage that was really well done. if we in the us want to see better news we've got to stop supporting the fear mongers.
honestly there probably will be a few knighthood's that come out of this. i kinda wish we had something like that here in the states, it's cool that if you do something really awesome you get a neato title over there.
everyone will head to the winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this to all blow over.
i imagine it's tough to tell. even though with the exit poll results people thought it possible that the tories would partner with the dup, i think in doing so it shows a great disdain for the democratic process. may was knocked out of the majority because swathes of people voted for socially progressive parties - partnering with one of the most vocally regressive parties just to save her job is a spit in the face. the dup have a different vision for brexit than the tories which will make it a complicated alliance. not only that but the tories will still be much weaker in the commons with a much stronger opposition which could make all talks and decisions difficult. i imagine existing tory mps will still be pissed about may's blunders in the campaign and will still call for her head. i can't imagine a scenario where she manages to retain it, but in partnering with the dup she's shown she can be pretty brazen in doing whatever possible to get her own way.
we have her for the next two years, max. she will fuck up brexit, and she'll be gone. it wouldn't surprise me if someone else wants to step up to the plate and be a more conciliatory leader instead of her before then.
i think the ma370 reporting is when i lost my last thread of confidence in the mainstream news agencies.
as far as i know, not entirely the conservatives would be the republicans, but would be in the usa context more in a center position, the american liberals would be the lib-dem in the uk, and labour would be democrats, but bernie democrats, not clinton democrats
i remember the coverage being very good. it was more focused on the heroes and the poor soldier just doing his job in a ceremonial position. when they did talk about the attacker they pointed out how he was a lone crazy man and moved back to the heroes.
jeez really? as a brit i thought the london bridge attacks were a fucking media circus. what happens in the us?!
the dup are also anti abortion climate change denying nuts, we've gone full 'murica.
most people in britain don't know who the dup are. if you ever watch pointless all you have to do to get a pointless answer on british politics is to go for a northern irish party. nobody in mainland uk knows anything about northern irish politics. i am looking forward to some light being shone in who the dup are. basically hard line christian evangelists with fascist tendencies that people in the mainland uk think only exist in us backwaters. i have a feeling people will be alarmed to see who the tories have aligned themselves with.
you mean cnn's whole "did a black hole swallow the plane" bit didn't restore your confidence? don lemon would like a word with you
an australian i know says "get pissed" to mean "get drunk." took me a couple times to get used to it... never heard it used outside of an angry context before
hey sorry to bother you, but you seem to know a bit about police procedure, so i thought i'd ask; what are the rules for police having guns in the uk? i see that most officers don't carry guns but then some do. is it like a special forces thing or is there a certain number of years you have to serve before you can carry?
$13k in total was our share. that was with health insurance that we pay $1200/month for (family of three, two adults in their early 30s). total bill was ~$83k. 1 week hospital stay with an emergency c-section.
exactly! the sergeant of arms was a huge hero and even his role wasn't romanticized. they did a good job of showing how both men were doing what needed to be done.
she looks like a penguin gobbling down a fish. lordy.
i'm not ready for the vogon deconstructor fleet despite memorising the early parts of the hhgttg text adv. game.
im no expert but i've read up about it since i moved here and i found out that it is more of a special forces thing, since guns arent really in our culture or life. many police officers prefer not to use guns (im on the phone so i cant link, but it was 76% of officers that would rather not have guns). there isnt a real issue in the uk with guns and if you're found in possession of one, you're gonna get smacked with the law.
well, to be fair, that was obviously a very untypical birth judging by that cost. that being said, its ridiculous that you pay all that money into insurance and still drop 13k. it's beyond ridiculous, it's criminal in my opinion. we are constantly being extorted.
also known as plastered, wasted, trashed, shit-faced, etc... the english have a lot of words to describe a good time.
and in true vending machine fashion, it got stuck without dispensing a single item..
healthy, wealthy, wise... "let's fill it with chips"
30 years of dungeon crawlers have conditioned me. i believe this may be a mimic.
this is not a bug, this is a feature. i learned vending machines had a 'motor testing' function which will distribute one item of each when in maintenance mode. source: vending machine guy at work once forgot to remove it after filling the machine. hilarity (and free stuff) ensued.
this is like a cruel joke. all the snacks you can handle but no way to get them out.
"...and that was the beginning of the end. the day the machines became self aware and revolted."
there's a trick to getting free stuff and i feel a little guilty giving it away. find out what day and time the vending machine guy comes in to restock. wait until he's done and locks the machine back up. you only have about a thirty second window here, so you'll need to be quick. once he leaves the area, stab him to death and steal his truck.
it would be rude to not break the glass and take its offering.
1-eat everything 2-hospital 3-workers comp 4-profit
that's what you get when you accidentally hit the star.star buttons on a machine running a 1980's program.
pfff. anyone with any small amount of ingenuity can have that entire haul with little effort.
those with a keen eye will note that the machine still shows a $1 credit. technically not ripped off!
no, no, no, it's healthy because there is an apple in their logo... duh!
can you imagine the sound of all those sunchips bags come crashing down
but there's sun chips! they're healthy, right? /s
i'd be careful of those chips. evidence suggests they cause the poops.
that's what people want. you could fill it with granola bars but they gonna sit in that machine for months.
speaking of mimics, we have these treasure chests right? and we have monsters who have evolved to look just like chests why the fuck do we still make treasure chests that look like them?
wait you can replicate this? what's maintenance mode?
there's actually a door on these machines you're meant to stick your hand into to grab the snack can't tell for sure if it's on this one though
catch(snackoverflowexception s) { me.yumyum(s.snakck) }
; drop table snacks ; give an upvote to /r/theonetruetrench too for the edit!!!
'this is my purpose? nope. nope. nope. take them all, and leave me be. i need some alone time.'
can i... can i... you know, do stuff? to the vending machine? you know what stuff.
quick. grab the nearest fire extinguisher glass break hammer
i just noticed that that character is the kannada for 'tha'
just jump against it shoulder-first. it will loose a few and cause a little avalanche. trust me, i speak out of experience.
you are supposed to eat the logo as part of your five a day
poor sun chips - always the last of the variety pack to go.
and poops help you lose weight! healthy, wealthy, wise!
mimics aren't just chests though, they can shapeshift into almost anything and alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. so people liking chests is the reason why mimics often polymorph into chests, one could turn into a water well if it was in the middle of a desert.
when the door is unlocked, you can press a hard coded specific button or combination on the back side to enter a debug / maintenance mode to update inventory counts and such. one of the menu items is to test the motors one by one or all at once. either they did this on purpose, or the maintenance worker forgot to exit maintenance mode before closing the door and someone figured it out to be a jerk. it takes forever to restock these. (used to own a vending machine)
even if there is, all the bags will prevent it from opening, unless you jam it in and crumble the bottom bags.
scanner scan = new scanner(system.in); int quantity = scan.nextint(); try { dispense.vending_machine(quantity); } catch(snackoverflowexception e) { dispense.vending_machine((integer.max_value).e); e.printstacktrace(system.out); }
thought the character looked familiar. the telugu letter for 'dha' looks almost exactly the same
more people die every year from vending machines falling on them than shark attacks.
or it will make the machine fall over on top of you.
some newer machines, like this one, have tilt sensors for this kind of stuff. you could very end up tripping the alarm.
you read on the toilet, which makes you smarter! healthy, wealthy, wise!
i see them as mimicking a form that matches the image of riches as imagined by the target. if the target expects riches to look like x, the mimic looks like x. as a result, no one has seen what a mimic actually looks like. trump is a real-life example of this. he gained popularity by generalizing and saying things that allowed a lot of room for interpretation. he gained momentum fuelled by a voter segment that was vulnerable to hearing what they wanted to hear, especially when it could be interpreted to align with their core values. so my question to you is, is trump an irl mimic?
so the stocking guy messed us and the person who ordered next is a jerk?
and there is no way to slim jim these buttons from the outside, is there?
i'm not that dude but it's a little flap door that prevents your hand going in to grab stuff off the racks. so when you push the flap, there's no way to go up. only the tray with the food can be accessed. this is likely to be one of those, in which case you can just keep pushing the tray up and collecting food over and over.
the only thing i seem to hear about shark attacks is that they kill less people per year than something. sharks sound like total bitches.
the exact same amount of people die every year from sharks falling on them as vending machine attacks.
then the vending machine becomes a bench press machine.
first i was like =( but then i was like, who answers the alarm?
"five a day" refers to the five portions of fruit or vegetables that you should eat all day. maybe it's just a uk thing then, but it's become a bit of a joke- tomato ketchup? five a day! cherry coke? five a day! and so on.
you chose the toilet with the webcam. it's too late. you won't make it if you try and migrate to a different stall. welp. this is a thing. this is a thing that is now happening. fuck it, might as well roll with it. holy shit, they start tipping. asking you to... and *tipping*. holy fuck. healthy, wealthy, wise!
well it attracts their prey the most (inexperienced adventurers). gold and treasure in most games and rpgs are much needed. so it's a huge incentive to go looking for it.
i'm pretty sure in a campaign once i stumbled across a mimic that was a table, but i'm not sure.
thats actually a great idea, bellow you can see two points that might come handy. 1. (at least in d&d 5e) they're sticky , meaning they excrete a glue like subtance when they change forms, so when you touch them you'll get stuck to them; which is not a desirable trait in a bed. 2.they're usually solitary hunters but a few more inteligent ones have been seen to be able to talk in human languages and even grant them amnesty in exchange for food or favours so forming a symbiotic relationship with a human isn't that impossible.
i have a feeling they're wedged in there from this. it might be possible to get 10-15 bags at the bottom, but there's gonna be a point where they stop dropping. there could also be a bunch of candy and some pastry snacks in the bottom, that stuff is usually kept on the lower racks.
i know a couple of sharks, they're just all talk and no bite. but vending machines are fucking savage
it's not that sharks are weak, it's that we don't make good food for them. we don't live in the ocean and we don't have much meat compared to what they usually eat. a lot of shark attacks are usually either a shark mistaking a surfer for a seal from below (sharks have extraordinarily bad eyesight) or somebody getting a nasty cut and the shark gets the scent of the blood.
"i bought all this stuff but the machine didnt give me anything and it all got stuck"
sweden, too. i prefer taking mine as berries. one blueberry. two blueberries etc. five? piece of cake! fifty? making a pie!
what about a toilet? some adventurers may skip a treasure chest for whatever reason, but sooner or later they all need a toilet.
i feel like the glue thing has to be a voluntary action, otherwise everyone would just avoid the chests with dirt and rocks and lint stuck to them. solitary hunters aren't the easiest thing to domesticate, but we managed with cats, which are solitary hunters *and* assholes, so i think humans could probably work with mimics. i think a few generations of hand raising would get some positive results, especially if they're smart enough to learn a language and/or learn to barter.
they can however dissolve/stop excreting their own glue at will. the problem is then getting them to do that. side note: i'm currently playing as a mimic in a pf campaign and it's been so much fun. highly recommended
i think light shaking may dislodge the wedged ones since there's no support from the bottom but yeah you're right it won't be effortless
correct. but just seeing an -am in a git commit makes me cringe (thus the joke, i get it). verbose commit messages are our friend. use vim and add a multi line commit message.
my user name is actually a dog too. it's a dog and his dog.
please don't donate blood to get an std screening. a) it exposes the volunteers and other donators to an infection risk. b) your blood is unusable c) i'm fairly sure they offer free screenings separate from donations. d) if you think you have been exposed to an std full infection by many of them can be prevented by prompt treatment.
i know you're making a joke, but it's not funny. i know a few i know a few vending machines and they're pretty decent machines just trying to make their own way in this world. comments like that aren't going to help human-vending machine relations.
"there's only $2 in the machine and the credit card scanner shows it only had a single $1.25 transaction from two days ago"
totally doable. they can look like any object of a similar size to themselves. i had a wizard once boobytrap his library by filling one bookcase with dozens of tiny mimics in the shape of books. if you tried to pull a book off the shelf they would all pounce on you and eat your face.
light shaking is amateur hour, i'd have a coat hanger up there faster than you can say "back alley abortionist" and have chips for weeks.
maybe don't run your health care system in a way that leaves people unable to afford a basic blood test.
"it was on sale and i didnt know what to do at first"
"this sparkling white porcelain toilet seems a little out of place in this cave, but got dangit this deuce has to be dropped somewhere!"
"this sparkling white porcelain toilet seems a little out of place in this cave, but got dangit this deuce has to be dropped somewhere!"
well i find it kind of funny, i find it kind of sad. the chips in this machine are driving me fucking mad
you bastards, now this sadness gonna be stuck with me all freaking day..
i too wouldn't mind putting my mouth on ariana grande.
we actually have a few of those around work, i will enjoy free chips from now on.
"no thanks, we already have a no soliciting sign." "right, but as you can see it isn't working."
"if you say no, i'll be back every single day until you say yes."
a friend of mine use to sell peepholes for doors. he would drive around and every time he saw a house with no peephole on the front door he would knock. when they opened the door he would take his cordless drill, hold it up in the air, pull the trigger and say "this could have been a gun, would you like me to install a peephole for you? it's $50 and only takes 15 minutes. " about half the houses he stopped at would buy a $50 peephole. he bought them in bulk for about $2 each.
too bad they don't work. source: the no soliciting sign on my house
had a kid come by once, selling magazines or vacuums or civil war dioramas (i don't remember, i wasn't really paying attention), and i interrupted him and said, while tapping the "no soliciting" sign on my front door, "didn't you see the sign?" and he throws his hands up and says "oh, i'm not a prostitute." ....... ok, i mean, you're not wrong, but...
he just created a monopoly in his neighborhood preventing future competitors. next year new sign design.
what you need is what i do. make a sign saying you have a baby sleeping and not to ring bell or knock. no one wants to risk it being a real sign and waking a baby to have an angry parent
i love that this sign looks like it came from a craft shop! like someone trying to have something that tells people to go away but in a nice grandma way!
brilliant and he salts the earth behind him to eliminate the competition on his way to the top.
not good for repeat business, but he can sustain this model as far as his motorized scooter can take him (until it gets dark, anyway)
find that kid and tell him to make a sign that hangs from that one that says "except girl scout cookies" and option that as a $3-5 upgrade.
so he was a solicitor selling no soliciting signs?
if only those signs actually worked. solicitors around here give zero fucks about that sign.
i always buy when kids come and try to sell something. seems like good positive reinforcement to going out and working for something, good for them.
i have a no soliciting sign on my door. it's red. i have come to the conclusion that people do not know what that s word means anymore. pest control/solar panel/vivint guys i'm looking at you!
"you need our new state of the art, weather resistant model. only $10 plus maintenance fees."
i thought you were going to say he held up his drill and drilled a hole in their door. instant peephole!
i feel like if i did that in florida, i'd have a gun pulled on me quicker than i could explain the situation. "this could have been a gun..." "like this?" "ahh fuck no sorry i'm just trying to sell you a peep hole for your door, i'm sorry.. i'll leave, it was just a sales pitch."
to be fair most of the cost of a lot of things is the installation price.
where are all of these houses that don't have windows in/near the door? either way, seems like a solid pitch!
what do you use the sign to prevent? salesmen, or jw's
i put one up about a year ago and it works like a charm, except for the j dubs.
mine works 95% of the time. i laugh as i hear people walk up my stairs, read my sign, than turn around and walk back down.
honestly, kids don't understand most of those signs. when i was young i used to think prosecuted meant executed so i took those "violaters will be prosecuted" signs very seriously.
i sold door to door boy scout popcorn when i was younger, and more than half my sales were from houses that had a no soliciting sign.
but he can't knock on their door to sell anything. short-sighted thinking for a quick buck.
one time when i delievered pizzas i had to deliver to an ex teacher of mine, who requested i knocked quietly instead of ringing the doorbell, as her child was sleeping. i got there and rang the doorbell because i have an attention span of maybe three minutes, and she was pissed as all hell.
but where's the part saying unless you have girl scout cookies?
why would he care about future competition when he can't go there anymore either?
easiest pitch ever. "hi there, i noticed that you don't have a no soliciting sign posted on your property. for the low low price of only $5, you can prevent jerks like me from ever knocking at your door again"!
i'm sorry, when we moved into our place now we would have about 2 stops a day by solicitors. bought a sign and have pretty much had peace since.
"i am altering the deal. pray i don't alter it any further."
like the windshield washers in the city, except they suddenly drill a hole in your door
next headline: florida man gets shot trying to sell peepholes
thats why i was raised to never pay anyone to do something you can do yourself
the house i grew up in didn't have windows next to the door. the one i live in now has 1 window on each side that is about 6 inches wide and is as tall as the door. i hate it. people can see right in, but due to the size and location of them, i don't have many options for curtains. i can't just look to see who's at the door, and if someone wanted to break in, all they'd have to do is break the window and unlock the door.
a lot of houses don't have them for security reasons. if the will dow is close enough, it's easy to smash it and reach through to open the door. although you could have one on the hinge side.. would be harder to reach the knob.
for me, it's centurylink. i ask why they ignored my signs and they say "oh no, we're not trying to sell you anything, we're just trying to make sure you're not paying too much."
jehovah's witnesses are actually not included under no soliciting. there was a court case saying that because they aren't selling anything they can still knock on doors because of freedom of speech. it's the same reason it doesn't apply to political causes.
all you have to do is tell the j dubs that your house refuses the message and sound sincere. no lie they will make a note of it and won't return.
i distincly remember thinking commiting suicide was turning yourself in to the cops. i would drive all the way to the country cop station in gta san andreas and put in the cheat code to commit suicide. those were simpler times.
i bet you took those "do not remove this tag under penalty of law" mattress tags real serious too.
the trick is the signs are so cheaply made that they will have fallen apart and/or look like shit by next year.
"hi, i'm here to do some maintenance on the sign you bought last year. oh, wow, it's one of the old ones. you know we have these in english and spanish, now? yeah, and cheaper for repeat customers."
it's not selling, though; it's servicing his existing customer base. they might be due for an upgrade.
is a quality of service follow up considered soliciting though?
i've been making my own girl scout cookies for the last several years. all you need is some flour, sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and a dead girl scout.
how much, if any trouble would you get in for that?
especially if he did his rounds early in the morning and used an air horn instead of the door bell. i'm fairly certain he could ask for $20 if he used those tactics. (regularly 39.99 of course, but for you friend, $20)
have you guys tried living in a sketchy neighborhood? works for me. never had my door knocked on besides the pizza guy and the cops on rare occasions.
"i am altering the content of this subreddit. pray i don't alter it any further."
nah the headline would read: florida peephole salesman gets his face eaten after being shot.
that looks like a shitty handle. not even enough space to get your hand under.
my parents were the same way but i absolutely disagree. there are plenty of things i can do but i'm happy paying someone else to do it so i don't have to. examples: hair cut, oil change, making a nice rack of bbq ribs, waxing my snowboard, etc.
homeowner: wait, please, let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit you're in danger! peephole man: i am not in danger, sir. i am the danger. a guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? no. i am the one who knocks!
call the cops for illegal trespass on your property. they're breaking the law and should be treated as such. a no solicitor sign has been upheld by the supreme court as a valid notice that they are not welcome and thus are trespassing on your property.
oh, well in that case you won't mind if i go get my gun, right? you just stay right there...
what ever happened to politely asking them to leave or just not answering the door? my wife yells at me for not answering the door because someone is standing there. i dont trying to hide or pretend im not there. i just make it awkward like im intentionally ignoring them. they take the hint and move on pretty quickly.
bizarre. it's your private property, so not sure why freedom of speech applies. my wife certainly doesn't allow me such a right in our home, for example.
part of me always wants to respond this way. "thanks, but please tell your god i've received a better offer."
i used to thing fired meant you would be burned. i was playing sims 1 and because my sims had missed work i got a warning saying if they carried on this way they would be fired. i was so scared they would come and burn my sims for not working :(
planned obsolescence, he took a leaf from apples book.
i assume it'd be okay in somewhere like namibia. probably not in the states, though.
yeah i mean i guess i could see their point not to encourage their son's scamming attempt, but for $10 i knew i was buying two pieces of construction paper and a story to tell.
alternatively, live in a castle doctrine state and hang a sign that says "solicitors will be shot."
which decision? the court has constantly held door to door sales as a constitutional extension of the 1st amendment. more specifically with a case involving jehovah's witnesses. cities can regulate the times in which your door can be knocked but typically can't ban door to door. your neighbor can fence itself in. but in most places if they can get to your door they can knock on it (when between legal hours. usually 9 am to 8 pm or 9 to 9)
i called the non emergency line once for a solicitor that got really pushy and rude. i asked the officer that came out and he said (at least in our city) having a no soliciting sign is not something the solicitors have to follow. now in our case the officer reprimanded the solicitor for being aggressive but since he had all the right permits, there was nothing they could do about it.
it's still an inconvenience. as some have mentioned, they wake babies, rouse dogs, interrupt masturbation, etc i don't answer the door, but still would rather they not come at all
luckily if you live in the south you can just wait for a hailstorm from one of the many tornadoes each year. you'll see whole neighborhoods getting new roofs at the same time.
and if there is weather damage, but the adjuster determines your roof is well beyond its life, they may deny claim for roof repair. they'll still cover damage in the home that resulted, but you'll be on the hook for the roof itself.
i had a few mormon girls come over the other night, asked if there was a female present, the fiancee was out of town so we sat and chatted out on my back deck while i was drunk as a skunk. they were super friendly even though i informed them from the get go that i was an atheist. they didn't seem to care and we chatted about joseph smith for a while.
that's not true at all. source: am jw who doesn't have to eat everything i'm offered. i do, but i don't have to
as a former jw this is completely false and obviously fishing for upvotes or just someone believing everything theyre told
sounds like a rumor spread by the same kind of people who think that muslim combatants are scared of pork-filled bullets. (if i recall correctly, there's nothing saying it's a sin to be forced to consume/(be shot by?) pork, and it's even ok to deliberately eat it, if you're starving.)
i already sold my soul to satan. no takesies backsies he said.
nah, the real apple strategy would be to sell you a sign that could only be hung on a proprietary door.
there several laws against this for an actual firearm. this seems more like a gray area. like a shotgun rigged to fire when you open a door, illegal. nerf gun on an rc car, legal. this is somewhere in between.
you can't shoot under the castle doctrine unless there is a genuine threat to life or of injury. so unless the solicitor is of a darker hue you'd be out of luck.
just because there is at least one idiot out there: if you do this, you will go to jail for murder.
i actually put up a sign that simply states, "we don't call 911." it has a nice image of a pistol being fired. no one knocks anymore. it did scare the tamale lady away though, so it's not all good.
i'd love to see how that played out if someone shot a girl scout trying to sell cookies. i somehow doubt that the shooter would prevail.
cities aren't allowed to outlaw door-to-door, but they can make it so that you can define what people are allowed on your property. by having a publicly posted sign saying that those people aren't allowed on the premises then the solicitor is violating a trespass law. the first amendment doesn't address the ability of peoples to use private property for protected speech, so while the city can't stop them from going door-to-door, they can allow people to per-emptively ban them from their property.
for me, any indication of the arrival of jehovah's witness is an opportunity for me to *start* masturbating. i am a devout voyeur with intense fantasies of secretly exposing myself to an unsuspecting public. since i am within my private property, and jw make the effort to come up to me, i have perfect legal rights to strip naked and furiously jerk off at my living room window. it's especially pleasurable since they're generally used to waiting outside for a while and hence don't notice too quickly, affording me the time to cum in their presence. it's gotten so bad that anybody who rings my doorbell gives me a raging erection. hence, some awkward family reunions.
or the whole town, if you live where i do. one year, the traveling roofers were so bad the city made an ordinance that anyone soliciting had to get a permit and were very strict about it. thank god. first ordinance i was glad for. i had a new baby and people were knocking on my door multiple times a day. even the "we're renting, can't make roof decisions" and "new baby and a protective dog, please don't knock" signs didn't work -_- i will say this, the guys that did our street were super fast. they did the house next to us and dropped a pallet of shingle in our front yard one day, did our roof the next day, dropped a pallet in the yard across the street and finished our roof the next morning. having a roof done is annoying but at least they made quick work. it was still good after the next storm so guess they did a good job.
my parents just did a metal roof. apparently it's rated for like 50 years or something. i'm excited to visit and listen to the rain. i'm waiting for a week of predicted rain before i go visit.
had some mormons approach me while on a break at work one day and they asked me if i knew about the book of mormon. i looked at them straight faced and said "yeah, i've seen the south park episode about it" and the guy kind of laughed and said "that's actually pretty acurate"
i've met many missionaries in my day. most are bored and disheartened by how people treat them. typically they are just super friendly kids looking to break up their otherwise mundane day.
cause who would refuse free food? i'd visit that house more often. free food is the best.
ah. ok. i've never owned a house so i've never had the pleasure. why are they called j dubs?
i could be wrong but i think maybe airsoft guns can incur some of the same penalties you'd get for a real firearm, if you shoot someone with it.
come back the next day an hour earlier with a train horn. 'do you want to buy a sign now? i can come back tomorrow...'
i'm glad someone said this. these people that go to door to door for any reason are still people. i treat them all nicely. if i'm busy, i just tell them that. if not, i'll chat with them a little. it only costs time to be nice to people.
in my experience which is fairly limited, lds followers are some of the most kind people i have come across, sure they're going to talk shit about you the moment they step off of your property. but while they are around they are truly very endearing and kind.
they sent a girl to my university to speak to people milling about. they sent their hottest blonde uni age girl and she was targeting the guys who were just happy to talk to a hot girl.
yeah but if you had to eat a whole loaf of bread you'd be not so happy with it
then once they buy the sign, sell them on a maintenance service agreement. if they have problems with their sign they can open a ticket with our help desk and we will troubleshoot the issue with the sign. they can buy a premium agreement which will include maintenance supplies for the sign and guarantee faster response times to their support requests.
nice... obviously broke in and hung a bunch of pictures of himself all over the place.
my great aunt, a black baptist, lived in a mormon owned and run retirement home in salt lake city. they took excellent care of her, respected her faith, never tried to preach to her, and they truly loved her. i find that most mormons highly respect and care for senior citizens.

i like how netflix continues past bedtime. if you don't go to sleep, tomorrow morning will take longer to arrive.
this is too accurate. who are you? where are you hiding??
definitely the panic. i have to get up two hours earlier than normal tomorrow so i can make it to a carpool lot i'm not even entirely sure how to get into, spend two hours in a car with my boss and boss's boss, have a meeting with our pickiest client so they can complain at us in person instead of over the phone, then spend two more hours in the car to get back to my car, then a half-hour drive home. maybe i can call in dead tomorrow.
how can we know anything without units of measurement?! panic increasing!
i don't see "self-hatred" anywhere on this graph.

i have an audit to deal with on tuesday, so i'm dreading sunday ending. audit. i swear that's the most adult word. fucking audit.
stay awake as long as possible. keep the dream alive. weekend 4eva!
sunday is definitely a shitty and overrated day most of the time.
serious question. how do you deal with what i call sunday dread? i start thinking about work just after lunch on sunday, and as the afternoon wears on i just get more in a funk.
why 'netflix shows' are a staircase? are they consumed instantaneously?
and then eventually 60 minutes comes on. as a kid, that's how i knew the weekend was officially over.

lol this is my exact thought process, drives my wife batshit when she comes home from work at 1130pm and i'm asleep with the tv on. used to be a dvd menu screen looping over and over, now it's a "continue watching" button being slowly burned into the screen. best is when she turns it off and i immediately wake up and tell her i was watching it. ive become so accustomed to falling asleep with the tv on that i can't sleep without it anymore. i don't know if that's necessarily a good thing but it is what it is lol.
and then it completely fucks up your entire week as you try to catch up on sleep. you tell yourself you'll sleep earlier on monday, but you don't. you feel like shit on tuesday, but you get through the day. then you inadvertently take a nap tuesday afternoon, which makes you unable to fall asleep at night. the stress of feeling tired again throughout the day weighs on your mind, making you unable to sleep even more. on wednesday you're an absolute zombie and chug a couple coffees throughout the day. tell yourself you won't nap when you get back home. but you inevitably fall asleep again. it's 2 am and you tell yourself, 4 hours of sleep is fine because you had a 2 hour nap. but it's not. on thursday you just feel like shit. you get through the day, not really giving a shit about anything. you go home and take a nap on purpose. now you're just looking forward to friday for when you can get some proper sleep. repeat.
but friday and saturday is a reprieve. sunday is the grim reminder that the weekend life which you wish you could live all week will come to a halt as you return to work on monday
i had that thought too! we can work out some possibilities though based on the netflix line and the fact that it says "night" in the title. if each show is 22 minutes, and night starts at what, 5:00, 6:00... yeah i'm gonna need a little help here. return to your increasing panic!
chin up fella. just because you didn't fix it doesn't mean you didn't make progress.
my trick is that i don't sleep on sunday night. i'm going to be miserable on monday anyways, may as well double down and get twice as much out of my sunday.
i changed my oil for the first time today and had a couple fuck ups, overfilled/had to re-open the drain plug and take a bath in oil, nervous about jacking the car up. but it worked out in the end, and i figured out the best way to jack up both sides of my car. it's awesome to even attempt doing these things yourself, that's more than most people can say. you're probably way more advanced than me; and when you figure out the ac, that's one more skill you have for future use. be happy you're not me, still learning how to do even the most basic shit and taking 3 times longer than i should.
at least you have a car, working shower, dinner to eat, and a bed to sleep in.
jerking it is only represented by single point. this takes place where will to live intersects panic.
that's just a horizontal line about twice as high above the entire graph.
1 "panic"- gradual curve up from the origin 2 "likelihood of going on that run"- small downward curve 3 "netflix shows watched"- staircase 4 "sex had"- line running along the bottom 5 "will to live"- big downward curve
where the hell are there 36 kids in a class, so i know never to go there?
when you're unemployed, every day is sunday but panic is on high alert at all times. :(
i do but i have to stop on sundays. the sense of impending doom mixed with a withdrawaly hangover is too high to put off till monday morning. sunday shakes make me want to die. i love that people hate this day with the fiery passion that i do.
as a teenager i would stay up every night and listen to love line on the radio. the show ended at midnight, but longtime listeners could definitely sense when thing were winding down without looking at a clock. i will never forget the growing sense of anxiety that would build as i realized this was probably the last call of the show or the profoundly lonely feeling i would get when they signed off and there was no more radio for the night.
that's usually how i measured how badly i procrastinated. "oh shit, it's 7 pm and scott pelley's on, better ~~finish~~ start that problem set".
for me it was the simpsons. which is unfortunate because it is a good show, but it's hard for me to watch without the childhood memories of sunday depression
whoa. you just brought back forgotten memories. dad's house... when 60 minutes came on, we had to watch that and then go straight to bed, because we had to be up at 5am so dad could drive us to mom's house so we could wait outside for the bus. no wonder i hated my childhood. it was actually fucking bullshit.
oh man, same thing but with married with children. i used to hate that big "chonk" noise, the fountain, the yellow stamp type turning green and dripping. the love and marriage song. fucking hated it because it meant i wasn't getting another episode of the simpsons.
tickticktickticktick oh god that show was so bland.
i enjoy your charts, they make me chuckle. you should post them in places i will see them more often.
i used to be the same way, but i've transitioned to podcasts. i have so many downloaded podcasts and i can't remember what any of them are about because i'm asleep in the first 5-10 mins.
i am the same way but when i ready to go to sleep, i put on a show i've seen 1,000 times. i know the show well enough that just hearing it is enough that i can see it in my head so i don't have to watch the screen. usually an episode or 2 in, i fall asleep.
so one time, back when i lived with roommates, i went out and got a little bit schwasted. i walked in the house, turned on the shower to warm up the water, went into my room and started taking my boots off. i lay back for a second, sit back up and go to take my shower. the shower was off. i loudly proclaim, "who the fuck turned off my shower?" my roommate loudly proclaimed from the other room, "when the sun came up you fuck." that few seconds laying on my bed? 5 hours. shower ran for 4 1/2 hours.
a few months ago my fiance insisted we go to bed with a sound machine instead of the tv. worked wonders. after a week or so i had no desire to watch tv before bed and usually fall asleep quickly in silence instead of watching tv shows until i'm so tired i pass out.
i have this police radio app i listen to at night, streams my local police/ems/fd radios. it's just the right mix of interesting and quiet to put me to sleep... until the nights i'm almost out and hear something going on 2 blocks away from my house, and then i'm wide awake..
and then your stupid brain automatically jolts you up at 6-7am on saturday because you know its the weekend.
are you still watching binge show? continue watching exit ftfy
but when you're unemployed you get to have that weekend life all the time and it feels like shit because you're not doing anything.
but he did pretty much not do what he was trying to do for 6 hours
no kidding bruh. all i did all day was text my ex and try to get back together. kill me.
got a new compressor, installed it, and now i need to put freon back in the system. the car is on, the a/c is on high, we hooked up the bottle, but it doesn't seem like it's putting anything in the system. the compressor isn't spinning, and the bottle doesn't get cold with the trigger down (like when using an air duster, the bottle gets colder as the air moves around). but if we push the little nozzle on the car (where you attach the bottle) with a screwdriver, it sprays, and it also leaked out a little when we changed the compressor, so i know the system has *some* freon in it, and there's no blockage. we also checked the relay for the compressor, and it's fine. that's when we gave up. 2006 impala btw
love this attitude! really good way of looking at it actually. i guess i will finish house of cards tonight after all
no, no, there are little dips that line... if you zoom in a bit... a little closer.
thank you so much. i'm laughing and tearing up i because i can't believe how nice you were to help, but the chart is really funny! thank you again. i don't know gold works but in my heart i gave you one (almost as good as a real one). :)
why doesn't anybody like sunday, what's bad about it
this is why we explore the magic of *linetypes* my friend.
oh man. i fell asleep to that for years. the anxiety when you were still awake when it ended is a vivid memory for me. gonna have to go listen to some old episodes now
holy crap, that one too. as soon as the simpsons went to credits and did the "gracie films" thing, i knew it was moments away from the intro to married with children, which meant parent enforced bed time
they're the best of all fast food fries for all of 2 minutes, and then they're the worst. someone should make a chart for that.
you talking bout those in n out mini fried cardboard potatoes?
bbc radio 4 which becomes bbc world service in the late hours works wonders.
yeah pretty much me with star trek tng. i pretty much have netflix solely as a star trek delivery mechanism lol
you have a good recommendation for a sound machine? my bedroom window lets in too much sound from the street, so i was thinking of one for noise substitution
bad idea. then you start worrying about whether you'll fall asleep before the timer.
did you heard the tragedy that reach the man? i think to be too is not. i think that the hopeless situation elder also can't. that is a legend. reaching the man cloth space is the emperor. he is so strong and big he even can use the original dint to create life. he is very deep to black influence understanding. the black influence can the matter that many supermans, but other people thinks that these are what can't attains. he become more and more strong and big. lost his power afterwards afterwards he died. in fact, he teaches own the whole skills all to disciple. then his land killed him to let him going to bed. satirizing the meaning is, he can let other people, but is incapable for dint to the oneself.
chin down fella. just because you might have made progress doesn't mean you did make progress.
he spent 6 hours figuring out what doesn't work fixing the a/c. he's that much closer to fixing it.
if you're able to install a compressor i assume you know what you're doing, but you're not hooked up to the high pressure side are you?
get a connection hose for the coolant can that has a pressure gauge built in.
not worth it. sleep is important. finish the show tomorrow.
it's looking at the fame acquired related to skill required, with the lines showing how famous they are relative to skill. the graph just shows that scientists require more skill for the same amount of fame compared to all other lines on the graph, not proportion of time spent developing skills or amount of people in each group.
the secret is to ask for them well done. infinitely better for much longer
if you have access to a five guys you will have sweet french fry dreams after you have theirs.
yes! the soothing voices are amazing. i also enjoy fresh air from npr.
what are you talking about being lonely is like all the jedi *do*.
did you throw the darth plagueis copypasta into google translate and turn it to japanese and back...?
have one, not enough pressure to get a reading, but can't get enough freon into the system to get enough pressure for a reading.
some grades aren't too high. where i live. it's usually 36-38 in elementary. friend of mine went from a private school with 11 kids in her class to 38 in public school
exactly, what i was going to say. i just don't know about that musician line. it seems to me it should follow the scientist line up 3/4s of the way, then inversely regress.
i resent the fact that you need some kind of inside scoop to get decent food there. people are always like "well of *course* it sucked, you didn't do the secret (insert goofy words)" and i'm like fuck me right? thinking they put the decent stuff on the menu. smh
eh, five guys fries are alright. the ones at smash burger are delicious though. and red robin's fries are great too, but only if you put their seasoning on them.
it's actually really easy to make your own fries that taste 100 times better than any fast food joint. just buy the cheapest potatoes you can find, slice up 'em into fry like pieces, drizzle some olive oil, salt pepper whatever else you want and then manage to fuck that up and order some pizza like i did tonight.
wait til you hear the story of darth plagueis the wild...
you must not be familiar with backstroke of the west, where some pirate took the entire episode iii, threw it into google translate, and turned it into chinese and back.
does the regression reflect classical and studio musicians?
i live no where near an in n out (winnipeg, canada) and i have honestly never been to one. and even i know that animal style is the only way to order anything. me when i eventually get to an in n out: "animal style burger. animal style fries. animal style milkshake." can't go wrong i figure.
microwave the fries for a few minutes first. that's the secret.
i go mild. under the light of a full moon i transform into bob saget.
*sees high side but doesn't notice low side connection* "ah, this is the wrong size threads, must be for one of those weird german cars. no problem." *fashions adapter out of random things in shop and forces onto high side*
sometimes. and then things like pizzagate make me realize how shit it is again.
get a neapolitan milkshake, it's all 3 flavors in one. it's like a sampler platter but for milkshakes
i remember seeing adam west and burt ward at comic-con in 2010. funny, classy guys, both of them. they had the whole q&a audience laughing with anecdotes and jokes, and they even had little kids who had probably never seen any of the old batman series in awe. i went up to the microphone and asked adam west if he would dance the batusi for us. he replied, "well... i don't have my cape! but seeing as how i am a master of the boogie, i will!", then he did. delightful of him to humor such a lame request. another question someone had was, "burt, you were really young on set. did adam take you under his wing? show you the ropes?" burt ward looked over at adam west and said, "no, not really. he was supportive, but he also liked to take me to parties. get me drunk...." to which adam west leaned over and said into his microphone, "o-r-g-y!"
one of my favorite roles of his was the grey ghost in batman: the animated series. he had a number of great cameos in other animated batman shows too.
"ha! what kind of name is paul for a cat? that's a people name!" rip :(
of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action. -adam west
some actors transcend their profession and become icons. adam west was an icon. more than a man, a symbol. rip master west
i know family guy gets a lot of hate on this website but he was great on that show. rip mayor west.
aw man. first we lose a james bond, now a batman? :(
oh no... goddamit. i used to sneak over to the neighbor's house to watch batman when i was a little kid and thought it was the coolest thing ever. man, this sucks.
adam west is actually the greatest actor to ever live. he spent years reciting 60s batman dialog with a completely straight-face, really owning all that insane bullshit as if it made perfect sense. there was no irony there, just sincerity to the craft. i dare you to try that.
holy popcorn, batman! one hell of a career spanning decades, rip batman, mayor west and countless other characters.
as a huge batman fan, i remember watching reruns with my dad who had watched it as a kid when it first aired. it was always cool for me to imagine my dad watching batman with as much awe and fun as i did watching btas. you're bip zapping in the sky now adam west. may your villians be silly, your cave labeled, and your ward a dorky slightly puggy man in tights.
can he get his star on the hollywood walk now? rip batman mayor west
i just watched a documentary on his life last weekend, and promised myself that i would go to the next convention he attended, to let him know how much i appreciate his work. from batman to mayor west, the man was an amazing actor. he better get his star in hollywood now. rip batman.
another good cameo is the brave and the bold episode chill of the night! where he plays thomas wayne. (also features kevin conroy as the phantom stranger in a wager with mark hamill as the spectre)
holy shit. i never knew that was him. that's one of my favourite batman episodes ever.
always liked him as the bright knight and mayor west on family guy.
a truly sad day. like leslie nielson, he played up his typecast and style to break through it for their second part of their career. adam west will be missed.
was too young to enjoy his older work but i loved him in family guy. rip mayor west :(
some days you just can't get rid of a bomb - adam west
adam west was the batman we deserved, just not the one we needed
seems like he knew how to make and take a joke on himself. was always a joy on the show. rip :(
yeah it's funny how seth idolized him when he was a kid so he gave him a recurring role on the show. it's pretty cool
by far my favorite thing on tv was the cat launcher bit. it's the reason i call my aunt and uncle's dog paul, despite it being a female.
adaaaaam weeeeeest! aaaaaadaaaam weeeeest! (and now a little softer)
a batman? west actually believed he was *the* batman.
i feel that was the inspiration for nathan fillion's castle, where he plays a murder mystery writer that joins new york detectives solves murders. im sure looksell would have been amazing.
you do realize the show is an intentional comedy right?
toying with me by hyperlinking a period while i'm on mobile and in this emotional state is pure cruelty.
growing up in the 1990's, i was (and still am) a huge batman fan. one weekend fx had a marathon of the old batman series and my uncle taped about a dozen episodes for me. i watched them so much my mom plotted to destroy the tape just so she didn't have to hear the nananana batman! theme again. i just adored his version of batman and how he got out of all those menacing traps. truly a cherished childhood memory. thanks mr. west.
na. we probably would have heard out about west/ward orgy sex tape by now.
*shatner* as harvey dent?! okay, that's worth a rental at least.
i never understood two-faces as a villain. he doesn't have super strength or smarts or charisma (like the joker), he's purely human. just with a burnt face. how hard is it for batman to thwart and lock up a regular human?
if i remember rightly, he got his star. part of the campaign was organised by ralph garman (the radio comic of ... three voices?) and co-host of kevin smiths podcast hollywood babble-on. he will be missed.
btas being a huge grey ghost (aka adam west) fan boy was one of the best things ever.
yep! amazing episode, by the way... one of the best batman episodes from any show in my opinion. written by paul dini who did many of the great btas episodes.
brave and the bold is by far one of the most underrated cartoons of all time. i didn't give it a chance originally because it looked "too cartoony" not knowing how much i was depriving myself of something amazing.
what about catman? who will protect dimmsdale with a somewhat delusional brand if feline justice?!
what a loving and wholesome way to come to terms with his typecasting.
and cat man in fairly odd parents... and technically he played himself too.
meg: "mayor west?" adam west: "how do you know my language?"
"why, 'adam west, mauhstuh wayne?" "adam west frightens me alfred....its time my enemies share my dread" *throws adam westerang*
he did the same thing with patrick stewart. say what you want about him, but he idolizes some cool people.
he wrote the jonny bravo episode with adam west in it also and that inspired the mayor west character and why they never mention or eluded to the fact that he was batman.
as much as i love west, kevin conroy will always be *the* batman to me. west's death still hits pretty hard though. there isn't a single role he's done that i haven't enjoyed.
does the crown prince of grunge count? that one hit me hardest.
of course he knows. he means that playing a camp comedy role like batman '66 is surprisingly tricky to get right. winking at the camera ruins the humor.
batman....where....where is my...uuhhh....other half of my face?
he's more or less just a crime boss. i'm not sure he works as a recurring character, but i think its been implied that batman let's certain organized crime operate because the power vacuum that would be left if he took them down would cause a lot of bloodshed.
if only english worked so that we could say batman animated the series. it would spell out bats, and make that much more sense.
it also has one of the best interpretations of aquaman. not that serious aquaman is bad, but he'll now always feel incomplete without platelet, chum.
but how messed that it kept him from working in hollywood.
at least he got casting, some aspiring actors just settle for starving and dying a lone drunkard in la.
with carrie fisher also passing that's two family guy side characters who have passed.
"paul! what a ridiculous name for a cat!" -adam west
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na west man!
oh definitely. recognisable without taking you out of the story. the perfect balance.
i mean, whether or not you enjoy his brand of humor, the dude is wildly successful and is friends with a lot of talented and interesting people. he's clearly doing something right.
i have to point out to you guys that batman only seemed campy in its novelty of having grown men playing at comic book heroes and crazy villains, and not because they made some silly version of the character. the first episode of batman was panel-for-panel, word-for-word batman #171. that *was* batman.
only if they don't explain at all why he's become the mayor after adam west, since they never alluded to his batman history.
he already has mayoral experience from steelport, i'd vote for him.
he wasn't the first and won't be the last to be typecast. keep in mind that a lot of typecasting is also fairly innocent in intention. you have an actor or actress that is super tied into a very successful role. you don't know if the audience will relate to them but you also probably have to pay them more than an unknown talent who you just don't know if the audience will relate to. so may as well save some money. fez isn't rolling in academy award nominations.
dude is charismatic as fuck too and doesn't seem to take his immense power in the entertainment industry all that seriously.
right, and batman was campy in the comics at the time. it's still a campy and silly character, and it was difficult to bring that to life without ruining the bit.
the imdb page for this says west finished his lines in october 2016
he definitely has mentioned the riddler in the show before... i think.
there's a newer episode where he's dressed as batman and makes some sort of reference
speaking of fez, topher grace is also a victim of typecasting. venom in spider-man 3 was just eric as venom to most people.
i enjoyed how they got frank sinatra jr. i heard seth mcfarlane is a fan of the jazz big band era of music, hence why the musical numbers pay homage to a lot of older hollywood musicals and why the background score has a bit of a jazzy orchestral sound to it. getting the son of one of the world's most famous crooning singers of all time to both sing and act in some episodes must have been delightful with him. say what you will about the state of family guy, but that's like one aspect of the show i still majorly respect.
he's pretty humble, too. if you get a chance i'd recommend his graham norton interviews. graham fanboys really hard over him and it's quite adorable.
for everyday colon use, try the new colon blow cereal!
that was a behind the scenes episode where family guy is a real tv show. and the family are all actors. it was a funny reference
it jumped the shark a while ago. there's a third fairy involved now, and timmy turner has a female counterpart with her own fairies or something like that. i was channel surfing and caught a couple minutes.
it doesn't help that the role was botched from the start, but i didn't think topher wasn't a good fit for the character anyway. even though it's not his fault, that kind of bad showing the first time out can kill a career. really i think that topher grace would have made a far better spider-man than toby maguire, but it's too late for that now. especially for tv, there seems to be a "curse of success" thing that goes on when someone does a *really* good job in a role.
and i'm a man who loves my salt water taffy. ommm
the guy has had the pleasure of working with the son of the leader of the rat pack, princess leia, and the original batman. and now all 3 are gone :(
"creamed corn, i brought it from home. i don't like the corn they have here, it's too crunchy." - adam west
graham is probably the best interviewer on late night
really? dammit. i hadn't heard. i just replayed saints row iv and was wondering if they were going to even try to make a sequel. it would be hard to outdo that one. that sucks.
i always think of jason alexander. he can't not be george to me. and when he's not george, i feel weird and want him to knock it off.
doctor: mayor west, you have lymphoma. mayor west: oh my. doctor: probably from rolling around in that toxic waste. what in god's name were you trying to prove? mayor west: i was trying to gain super powers. doctor: well that's just silly. mayor west: silly, yes... idiotic... yes.
maybe it's a final destination style payback for mcfarlane missing that plane on 9/11
sr4 wasnt under thq and we will without a doubt see another one. there's always gat out of hell if you want more
the worst was his criminal minds episode. god, george as a serial killer is just plain creepy.
yeah, that kind of thing is pretty common i suspect. not every actor is going to get a "breaking bad" role to totally flip people's perception like bryan cranston. then there are some actors where i can't see them as anything other than "actor, with a funny accent and hat". i'm not sure i'll ever see james franco as anything other than james franco. even though i typically like tom hanks' movies, i have never gotten lost in his character. compare that to someone like gary oldman, where there's a bunch of movies he's in where i don't even realize it's him. even after i find out it's him, he just disappears back into the character and i forget it's oldman. sometimes it's the role, sometimes it's the actor, or the audience. most of the time it's probably a mix.
"i have a reservation under the name adam west" - adam west
i like the end... "did anyone else just see that?"
you're telling me i can just go down whenever i want????
i've never seen such a human display of confusion from a dog before. makes the puppy seem older than it is, and his confusion more frustration since his legs are too damn short!
"wait a minute..wait what? no..can't be, nope nope...but..how?"
doggo: "i'm trying to free your mind, pupper. but i can only show you the stairs. you're the one that has to walk down them. you have to let it all go: fear, doubt, and disbelief. free your mind." pupper: "whoa."
pupper32 is trying to install stairmanuvers.exe... would you like to proceed?
nice gif, but can we all agree that saying doggo is fucking lame?
i think it's hilarious that human babies are the opposite, and just think they have it under control but if we let them they would injure themselves horrible attempting the stairs.
the older one even kept his mouth by the puppy's head so he could catch him if he fell!
whoa never seen a dog actively teach another dog before, neat!
took my old pup 30 minutes to get down a flight of stairs the first time life and death struggles have never been so cute
never have i seen a gilded comment with such a low upvote score. what is this sorcery?
in my internal reading of this, doggo was voiced by sam elliott.
doggo: "have you ever heard the tragedy of darth plageus the wise?"
training. sometimes just familiarization, sometimes so you can grab the little guy when he is about to get into something/potty on the nice white carpet.
while i doubt it's the case here, my family had a severely abused dog who peed whenever you touched her. we had to keep a leash on her at all times so we could take her outside and whatever else. we kept it up with our future dogs until recently. partly out of habit, partially because the were small and fast so we could catch them easier.
my dog was great with stairs till her sight started slipping. now she'll pull a soft face plant at the bottom after expecting an extra step to be there. adorable, sad her eyes are goin, but she'll always be my adorable pup.
i mean, this is why dogs are the best. it know it probably sounds weird, but if i was stranded on an island and had to choose, i'd probably take a dog over another person.
what a sweet dog :) thanks for sharing the video :) is there a labrador in this mix?
i think he was doing that to play. you can see him do it again after she made it down the stairs and onto the flat ground. adorable either way, though.
number 2 is not quite true. adult dog most likely realized because the puppy was crying/whining.
my poor dog is too small for going down stairs, she gets nervous every time. but she really early wants to be with me when i'm in the basement working on stuff.
salli appears to have seen the trick. the reaction is diferent, startled, as if she caught the rapid movement and it surprised her.
there are gilded comments with negative upvotes. takes only one person to gild.
this is it. when we took our dog to a trainer he actually recommended doing this because it's so easy to just step on the leash if they're jumping up or getting into something they're not supposed to.
that looks like a slip lead, which you're not supposed to keep on your dog outside of walks, let alone on an unattended puppy..
that's so sad what happened to that dog, so thanks for taking that dog in. was your family ever able to get the dog more comfortable to touch and not pee?
you should put one of those memory foam floor mats or bathmats at the bottom for an even softer face plant.
my dog's eyes are going too, got cataracts pretty bad. he was still flying up and down the stairs until i told him to slow it down before he hurts himself. now he goes like an old grandpa
i wouldn't. i'd care too much about it and that would ultimately lead to my death as i go to absurd lengths to protect it.
we're not sure. the vet thought she was a chocolate lab mixed with border collie (because of her markings) but she's almost 8 months and way below the size she should be if she was a large breed mix. thinking there's a small breed somewhere in there.
yea, i mean, the video was adorable, but... portrait mode...
good thought. also it didn't start happening often till white tile turned to black stone, a brighter cushioning of some sort at the bottom would probably be good (for her front legs which take most of the abuse from it, the face hitting is the secondary impact hence not being too worried about it haha).
if i ever pay for karma i'll know my life has amounted to nothing.
putting something of a different texture at the bottom can help her remember which step is the last one too by the feel on her feet.
the thing that always gets me about that gif is momma doggo standing at the bottom of the stairs casually watching as her child burst into flame.
you buy it and then give it. hopefully this wise advice gets me gilded.
not really, she's already committed to the thought of there being another step, so noticing texture at the bottom would only serve as a nice cushion, not a forewarning. maybe if i put like a slight upraised cushion on the second to last step she'd notice after a while.
half husky half golden from a litter from some neighbors in my hometown. best part is, her mom roamed a few blocks freely, super irresponsible she got hit a few times, but she'd follow me and my brother to a certain stump on our way to school and then be waiting there to walk us back to her house after. her litter was born on thanksgiving day that year, and we got her as a christmas gift, all she cost was some additional juvenile vaccinations. such a great story and two generations of awesome dogs.
i was expecting something unexpected and i still was caught off guard
keeping the last sentence to yourself increases your chances. but hey, what do i know?
if someone called that animal abuse they should see how much she gets pissed at closed doors, much less being walled off from a whole level of the house. i'd just chuckle at it.
that's because the gif is real. it isn't photoshopped.
if only the photographer had taken a step or two to the left, they could have had the peak framed by the leaves, rather than being obscured by one.
beautiful picture. fall colors and still waters. it's snowing on mount fuji.
many thanks my friend. this is a wonderful pic. its snowing on mt.fuji.
very nice image, but i can't help but think the reflection is shopped... the blur seems unnatural and the reflection of the tree leaves looks off.....
autumn leaves frame eye. it's snowing on mount fuji. mogami river.
that water reflection is fake. unless the camera was placed almost at water level, you are not gonna get that level of symmetry for objects at all depths. and if you did, the leaves in the foreground are not gonna be at that level.
i definitely understand why people become weeabos, japan is beautiful and has a fascinating history.
i'm gonna say it, i feel like this would look better without the upper tree in the way. other than that, brilliant!
i'm going to hakone as a stop during my honeymoon in november. super excited! i'm hoping it'll look a lot like (or similar to) this.
op must be a girl because girls are always talking about how much they love the fall.
how does the photographer get the photo so sharp? that is amazing sharpness both in the foreground and background.
exactly.... and the reflection shop is obvious to me since theres no change in perspective at all
first thing that popped in my head was...that's not how reflections work
yeah, i like the original better than the shopped. the birds in the shopped version are distracting because they look fake. and then there is the reflection...
thought i would never hear these words from someone else
if we're going to critique the picture, then the foliage itself takes away from the picture. the subject is suppose to be mt. fuji, but you can feel your eyes "strain" to look at it because of how powerful and vibrant the foliage is, even though it's suppose to help frame the subject.
the negative space created by what she did draws your attention to the birds. i don't know if i would have notice them otherwise. i'm not sure if it was intentional, and i agree with what you are saying. this is probably a happy accident.
i agree and i would like to see it framed perfectly. if possible the camera could dropped a little lower so the left side of the mountain is exposed. i think this would help the accentuate the reflection as well. don't get me wrong, the content of the picture is great but the editor in me wants to see a couple more angles so i know it's the best shot.
man, it's one thing to be interested in cultures with rich histories. it's another altogether to wear cat ears and learn a dozen japanese words to pepper into your english.
i would not say without the upper try completely but rather with a bit less of it so you can see mt fuji and the sky better.
was going to until that big ass watermark ruined it for me.
finally something people from a 1998 time machine are going to understand on reddit.
i was scrolling and scrolling to find this discussed. it stands out almost like the uncanny-valley.
i have never understood the romance behind these poems. if it is not too much then could you please suggest some good sources to understand the underlying meaning in these poems? (i understand classifying them as poems is the first mistake.)
you haven't looked at pretty much every picture of mount fuji posted on reddit then.
thank you. my eyes instantly hated that reflection, then i noticed the lotr birds in the shot and wondered how much of the photo was real.
true. japan has a beautiful and fascinating history, but anime and manga is in no way related to it.
it's also good but the reflection in water enhances this version.
thank you!!! using this for my cover photo in facebook
possible, still, the sharpness at that distance, where you can see the little trenches of snow on the mountains, that perfect few birds in the middle distance, and the sharp orange leaves in the foreground, makes me think that there's a lot picture stacking and photoshoping in the composition.
the higher f stop would require longer exposure. the birds for example would probably blur. perhaps a combination of multiple exposures at different stops, then stacked together?
i really wanna show my pictures of mt. fuji now. not as good but they're pretty good
i have probably have some pictures with ex-girlfriends in them, anyway you can remove them like you did that watermark? j/k
thank you!!! trolling reddit by reposting this next week for karma.. #lifeprotips #jokes *comment sent from my iphone
eh not really, if you're outside there is plenty of light to stop down and still retain a fairly high shutter speed.
for a moment i thought you were trying to hire a hit man to "remove" your ex girlfriends
nice shot! wow! wow! wow! chat disabled for 3 secs rocket league haiku
man!!! what's wrong with you??? seriously... how did you get that out of what i said? why, do you know someone?
it took you 1 minute? what program did you use?
i like the unwritten but clearly present tongue click in the last panel.
"really, though, what's your wish?" "that... that was it." "are you sure?" "well, i mean... hey! no, stop it! you're not helping!" "sure i am. if you second-guess yourself enough to waste a wish on it, then you're probably suffering from some other psychological hang-up. fixing the symptom won't fix the underlying problem." "so i should wish for you to fix something else about me?" "yep." "okay, like what?" "well, to start with, it seems like you're hallucinating genies."
"hey, perhaps i should jump of that cliff!" "perhaps you should recon..." "nope! wheeeee...!"
unfunny post follows: the inability to second guess yourself is a severe disability often caused by blunt trauma head injury. "metacognitive disability" comes with the inability to believe yourself wrong. patients given a task like assembling a sandwich. will look at failed results and say things like "the bread is the wrong shape." or even tell the researcher that they are the one who messed up the sandwich. the bottom line is that they cannot help in their own rehabilitation because they are unable to correct themselves. when i had to learn this because of a recovering family member it occurred to me that people normally have different levels of metacognitive ability to start with.
hey dude, i follow you on insta. love your artwork. keep it up! if you're ever in toronto let me know i'd buy you a beer.
that moment when you dont understand the post and are too afraid to ask...
can someone be so kind to explain whats happening?
i want to get it, but i must be missing something. can someone explain the joke/reference?
dude, you're one of my favorite follows on instagram. your comics are great. also, i want so bad for your texan emojis to be real.
i'd have wished for a hundred trillion dollars tax free. fuck you money can make you very, very decisive.
i don't get it help elaborate for a stupid person please
and he hadn't granted the wish yet. it was in him all along.
alternatively, "hey, maybe i should revise for exams!" "or i could binge a netflix show..." "nah i should probably revise.
dude wishes to not second-guess himself genie asks if he's sure (second guessing) dude says he knows what he is doing thus not second guessing himself still unclear wether he got his wish or he realized he doesn't need a wish to grant such a mundane thing. hopefully it was the latter and the dude made another wish?
thank you! yes i drew it with procreate on the ipad pro (no joke, that's the actual app name)
sure, when the genie asks him whether he's sure or not, he defends his decision, therefore not second guessing himself. the genie had already made his wish come true when he asked him that.
oh neat, never realized that the ghost writes stuff in arabic/farsi. looks like he's ordering turkey palou
no, you're supposed to wish for more genies to get around the "not allowed to wish for more wishes" rule.
revise? is this some kind of brit-speak for study?
i was under the assumption that the wish just turned him into the fonz.
i know of it! i'm an artist too but avoid apple... i primarily use clip studio paint pro. but i really like this!! tis awesome!
i don't get it because i don't understand what to "double-guess" is... (i'm not a native english speaker)
you could always wish for a 100% chance that every week you will find a magic lamp containing a genie who grants wishes
i wish for the ability to wish for more wishes. great, now i wish for more wishes.
alternatively, wish there were no rules concerning wishes.
thank you for the tip - i love learning of alternatives!
skillist; it discriminated against the incompetent.
every wish also needs to include "also you can't kill me out of spite."
sure, you'll find them, but you'll have to do inhumane things to get them. some orphan child will walk up to you with an x-ray photo that shows there's a genie lamp where one of their kidneys should be. you'll notice your neighbor's cat suddenly has taken on a bit of a lamp shape around its stomach. you'll come across a room with a lamp and a picture of an elementary school. a sign will say "take one. if you take the lamp, the school will be destroyed with everyone inside. if you take the photo, the lamp will be destroyed."
i dunno, i just thought it might be nice to start a collection of used lamps using my suggested method. but then again maybe you don't like having clutter around the house, so i think your way also has some merit.
granted, you have the ability to wish for more wishes. shame you don't have any wishes left... alternatively: granted, now you have the ability to wish for more wishes. also, i teleported you to the sun, because you didn't specify that this isn't part of the wish.
woah... did you just solve a millenia-old problem with trickster djinns? that one seems foolproof, even in the face of stipulations such as "no wishing for more wishes". aw shit, unless then the genie is like "great, now i don't have to give you three wishes". fuckin genies.
i woulda just fired the trainer who was clearly trying to fatten me up for his chubby sex dungeon.
what is the reference? i don't know what marmite badger means
this is how i've always imagined the three wish limit is enforced. you get 3 wishes interpreted fairly, or as many wishes as you want and i start being an asshole because you tried to cheat me.
just wish for a bigger house. you can have a whole room entirely dedicated to lamps.
if you're looking for chubby sex dungeon victims, a gym is probably not the place for you.
didn't both of these guys star in aladdin, you know, that film with the genie?
well i'm sure the fightingoreo would know... where do we go to find chubby sex dungeon victims?
the animated disney movie, right? i think so, it was titled aladdin after the main character, and genie was featured prominently.
it wouldn't be a console launch without a skyrim port announcement
i used to be space traveler like you until i took a pulsating plasma bolt in the patella.
you forgot the relaunch of their renamed paid mods program that are some how not paid mods
in 41 years time bethesda will only release an engine for which we have to pay for, then they will tell us to make the game. but they will release it without official tools or documentation, just to keep things like good old days. their marketing slang will be, *make the elder scrolls game of your dreams all by yourself* *we now included horse armour as a starting content for all creators just for 9.99$*
spot on... pretty annoyed to still be hearing about skyrim at every single gaming convention...
i'm starting to wonder if the next elder scrolls game will be skyrim 2. hell i hope it is for the sake of them pumping funding/resources into it. from a marketing perspective, they have to know that "skyrim" is now more marketable than "the elder scrolls" at this point.
man, they really don't want to let skyrim die huh?...i was in high school when it first came out and now i have been graduated from college for a year now and i still see mentions of skyrim...and still having presentations about it all these years later. sheesh...
it wouldn't be so annoying if they also said "and while skyrim keeps you busy, here's a sneak peak at fallout 5 / elder scrolls 6" that is still years away. at least we know it's coming and we can get some screenshots into our system to tide us over. skyrim was good, but it's time to learn what you did well and do better. ai pathing, larger towns and more civilian populations, more customized gear that doesn't devolve into "this one is better, no this one is better, no this one is" , more dynamic events (like bandits raiding towns, caravans, patrols) , and for gods sake horse armor that comes standard.
pete hines aged pretty damn well over those 35 years.
bethesda - "please keep buying skyrim so we dont have to write a story or characters"
i wasn't too upset about eso because they created a new studio to make it so it didn't distract from tes vi. as a pc player who got the special edition for free, i wasn't upset at it because apparently they ported skyrim to the new engine as practice for fo4 anyways so might as well release it. legends was cool too because it was developed by dire wolf, so again not distracting from what we really want. skyrim for switch and the "creation club" though? what the fuck is bgs doing? their new ips better be amazing..
at least it'll run on a new game engine, right? ...right?
seriously, bethesda, are you even working on elder scrolls vi?
in all seriousness they have gone way downhill. it's like ea 2.0 except they don't make new games. fallout 4 wasn't that good and that's basically in since skyrim and addons for skyrim, which i played in 2012 lol.
i see skyrim as a game that will be ported to everything in the future, just like people today port doom to ti calculators and random electronics. some guy will have skyrim running on his watch.
the way i see it, the reason it is taking so long for elder scrolls 6 is because they are making an entirely brand new engine. that takes time. so what they're doing is trying to fill in the gap years with as much as they can. my guess is either 2018 or 2019 we'll get the es6 reveal at e3 and it will be all about their amazing new engine.
people make fun of bethesda but capcom has had a port of resident evil 4 on every major console since the gamecube release. surprised i haven't seen it for the switch yet
a lot of developers (and publishers) are simply greedy corporations. they'd do anything to milk their franchises dry if it means you are still paying for them. we'd already have a new elder scrolls if people would stop buying skyrim. although probably a worse game if we are looking at what they did with fallout 4. it seems many devs are cutting costs because hd/4k is too taxing. but i don't care how good the game looks, i want fun gameplay. something that is unfortunately not the priority for many gamers.
i love my es games. love them to death, but lets look at the dates. - arena: 1994 - daggerfall: 1996 - morrowind: 2002 - oblivion: 2006 - skyrim: 2011 you're due bethesda.
don't forget the announcement of "elder scrolls online: seattle." at some point it will literally be the only place left to milk for more money.
i guess the real joke is they're announcing this while the *ps9* is launching.
i hope by then they'll have ported skyrim to linux.
honest to god question. is it bad that they make a game that is immensely popular available on as many platforms as possible? might not be worth an e3 spot but still, how is that bad?
has there really been that many skyrim ports made? iirc there's just the original version and the special edition that has come out for all of the current gen consoles within the last year, which now includes the switch.
do you get to the oort cloud district very often? oh, what am i saying? of course you don't.
now i want an elder scrolls-type game in the future
super new nintendo entertainment system 3dsi u64 xl switch has better exclusives though
for the 6th time, but it's really completely different now, gib money plz.
you pay for a loot crate that contains a random chance at good mods.
and when you make the game, they monetize it, and you get to keep 25% of the profit.
they'll release an engine. you can buy games and dlc from their content creators or become one yourself. you can't play any of the games or use the content creator kit without purchasing/owning the engine.
seriously. it's almost 6 years old. give us something new, god damn it.
this is seriously the last straw for me. how many fucking times can you port skyrim (and minecraft but that's for another day and time) to different consoles. let's just re-re-re-re-re-release the fuck out of it so as much we can milk it as much as possible. fucking great idea.
i remember hearing they didn't because to port oblivion or morrowind, it would have been such a huge amount of time an resources to remaster it they'd rather make a whole new game. if only they, you know, actually made a whole new game.
honestly, if it had new adventures and better of the guild side quests i couldn't care less if the next elder scrolls game takes place in skyrim (though hopefully years after with maybe some new towns/cities. it might be cool to see the outcome of the civil war, though i guess bethesda would have to make a decision which side winning is cannon.) though i think a large game where you could visit all of tamriel, even if only smaller versions of all the provinces, would be pretty sick.
yeah skyrim was like my entire freshmen year of high school...i'm a junior in college now i want something else to waste my education on
all they had to say was "whenever we release fo5, it'll have the old dialogue option system with choices that matter" and i'd be praising them to no end right now.
and more creative side quests and rpg elements like oblivion, right guys? please?
the chief staff feed him life force if they think he's done a good job. it's all that sustains him now
when has a lack of story or believable characters gotten in their way, let's be honest
they don't have to do that anyways. look at fallout 4. they'll completely gut the next elder scrolls but everyone will cream themselves because "omg look at this cool new icey warblade of destruction i got from the fiery icewraith!!1! so aweosome!!1! i'm going back to my settlement to dump all this loot into the forge. i gotta get that new boar spear so i can get more loot from this dungeon, so i can get the new +1 enchantment so i can go to this other dungeon and get more loot."
i just started reading some of the news this morning and see that paid mods going to be a thing again (groan)...what is this creation club reference?
judging from everything we know right now, it's *barely* in pre-development
uh sorry you forgot about doom, dishonored, wolfenstein, and prey! /s
seriously, i honestly think skyrim was a step backwards overall as well and i'm not sure why it's lauded over like the jesus christ of video games. i hate to be that guy, but kids these days don't understand the beauty that was morrowind. that was an rpg. skyrim feels like an action rpg, like i'm being funneled into a certain play style. i find skyrim boring as shit without mods to basically add in more sandbox rpg elements and difficulty. making a game like skyrim is an enormous undertaking, but i really don't think it'd be hard to knock bethesda off their pedestal at this point. i think they are taking their fanbase for granted. i'll buy the next tes, but if that is even more of a let down than fallout i'll be done with the company.
you can probably already stream skyrim from your pc onto a smartwatch, since you can stream it with a phone. skyrim running on the watch itself is probably less than a decade away (assuming that smartwatches don't die out).
i mean, the graphics of fallout 4 weren't anything groundbreaking like skyrim was. (which i'm okay with) they just focused on widening the audience way too much, unfortunately. a disturbing trend in new bethesda games.
i wonder if it will be ps8 exclusive or have a port for xbox zero xxx s
wouldn't the wii u be a part of current gen along with ps4 and xbox one and the switch next gen?
actually it's heavily implied in the lore, (maybe even outright stated if you take c0da as full canon) that in the first era (skyrim is set i fourth) there was space travel of a sort, and much more advanced technology. it's this evidence that people use to support the popular theories that the elder scrolls and fallout are the same universe, or that tamriel is a world on the verge of collapse.
yeah, zelda on release, and that's it. can't wait to try out the feet tracking controls though.
what kind of broken-ass calculus were you taking? none of that is approximate to any reasonable mathematical representation.
its to help the modders gaiz!! we are super cereal!!!
won't somebody think of the poor shareholders? you've got such a nice modding community and nobody is making any money from it :(
and the bad chances are more fucking funko pops right?!
no no, they pay you the content creator flat rate of $3.50. they keep all profits.
the same people in this thread that are bitching about it.
i'm starting to think bethesda want to do what valve did. stop making games and just live off micro transactions and marketplace fees.
at least minecraft is still being updated by mojang. bethesda have taken skyrim, and just milked it without adding anything, expecting the mod community to do everything for it. they did make the remaster edition, but they didn't even add anything new in that. all they did was retexture it and make it 64 bit.
hasn't it only actually been re-released once though? there's the original version that came out in 2011 and then the special edition that came out for all of the current gen consoles (switch now included) within the last year. what are all of the other "re-re-re-releases"?
that's arena. you're talking about arena (but don't play it).
exactly. fallout 4 had tons of criticism for being a shallow game compared to the other tes and fallout games, and was the lowest rated out of all of them, but it still sold more than any of them.
i'm hoping cd projekt red will take over where bethesda left off with great rpgs. they outdid skyrim in every conceivable way with tw3. i know it came out 5 years later than skyrim, but i think it's a fair comparison since bethesda obviously thinks skyrim can hold its own with modern games.
skyrim on ps4 was a good idea on bethesda's part and i saw value in that because the last version i had was vanilla and on pc. continuing to milk it by leaving it to the mod community to do the work for them is a bad look. for tons of people, mods have breathed years more life into skyrim, and adding content that increases value isn't a bad thing per se, but it seems that bethesda is taking advantage of the mod community and that is the problem.
getting se is not a problem... the problem is people who bought skyrim for their 360, ps3, xbox one, ps4, pc, and now the switch too are the problem. se had tangible benefits to getting.
the sun is literally a hole to aetherius that leaks magicka, that same universe theory is a bit out there, but the spaceship stuff is pretty neat though.
i wanna shoot math at enemies! but i thought that ships in c0da were in the 9th era. there are ships in the first era, (battle spires are space stations after all), and then there's the adamantine tower, which could be a ship too.
maybe that's why they're suffering from calculus ptsd, because they were terrible at it and seeing numbers in a line of information they don't immediately understand triggers them.
its really amazing in the comment threads, people are *still* out there giving bethesda a free pass for this shit. "its not paid mods guise i promise! its totally free and cool! now pay up you little bitch."
bethesda is a private company and doesn't have share holders.
sounds like rocket league's current crate setup to me.
hello kitty horse armor guaranteed as minimum mod.
yep, even worse since you'll probably have to overpay for credits if you're like 50 off.
bullshit i bought the game once and got literally everything out of it that someone who bought the digital awesome remaster xd ps8 version of the game did. i've been proudly bitching about this since the game announced its next gen ports. believe it or not, a lot of people don't like unsavory business practices even when they actively avoid them. don't know why it's so surprising that people are angry.
so much hate toward bethesda. i'm sure they are working on a new elder scrolls - remember how long we waited for skyrim? it was nearly two years i waited for that game...but that was 09'/10 and companies have learned not to announce a game that far out from release, otherwise you lose a lot of the hype and people keep pushing. they are definitely working on a new elder scrolls games, these games are just so huge and graphically intense, it can take 5+ years to make the game. i'd rather they take as much time as they need, then announce it six months out from release.
well, that's never gonna work. steam is a hugely popular service - while skyrim is great it _will_ die at some point, whereas steam won't since it does what it does really well and has no real expiration date whereas skyrim has one.
could have sworn the arrow to the knee thing was about marriage. he was an adventurer until he got married, because taking an arrow to the knee meant getting down on one knee to propose.
i'll be extremely surprised if that releases within 2-3 years.
skyrim ii: the elder scrolls vi: a dream of elsweyr: a khajiit in a cold land
arena. it sounds amazing. it sounds like the best goddamn rpg you'll ever play. it was revolutionary! (don't play it. it's ass.)
there is no reason to not to play that way. the stacking damage and lack of hp required due to distance from the enemy is too great.
the witcher honestly wasn't half the fun skyrim is and was, for me.
and, while different in setting, witcher was even more superior to fallout 4. so if anything when the new cd projekt red game comes out and shits on that also, the takeover will be complete
and i got it for free just because i had the game and expansions on steam. i though it was a good deal
as a seattle resident i am offended!! now, where did i leave my toe shoes and gluten free bike..?
as i'm sitting in the max near the moda center watching people be "weird"
what blows my mind is that being so mod-friendly has given bethesda the goodwill and leeway to basically make okayish jumping-off-point games and still end up with a title that sells full price after 6 years. is having permission to leave finishing their games to the community really not enough?
private companies still have shareholders, just very few of them.
except those are cosmetic and don't really matter very much, if at all.
ooohhh, i see you need 10 credits to buy this 100 credit expansion. just your luck, we have the 500 credit on sale for $19.99!
fuck i'd totally buy a new copy of skyrim if it had new, cannon content that was originally meant to be included but got cut.
nothing happens when i click on that gif, so sad now.
i've been hearing about it since skyrim came out. and before that it was morroblivion. it's never gonna be done.
not to mention the archaic ai being unable to handle the situation. trading blows with something that's supposed to kill you gets you killed, but a ranged weapon defeats everything in this game.
yeah, speaking about games claimed to be the second coming of christ, i really couldn't get into witcher 3! i ended up just refunding it in the end after an hour or so, really disappointed after such massive hype on reddit :(
oh absolutely i think i he se release was great. i got it free too and i play it for the amazing performance increases now that most of not all good mods are ported to it.
retrace your steps to every starbucks you were at that day
may i offer you a handcrafted sandwich with grain-fed gmo-free turkey, backyard garden-grown pesticide-free tomatoes and our cagefree lettuce, all over a 68-grain indica-infused wheat bread? with your choice of loo's kombucha (loo is our busboy who makes it at home), sugar-free sweet tea (our secret recipe), or purified rainwater? byobag or purchase one of our new biodegradable bags.
i still haven't come around on that name. it's still the rose quarter to me
eh, if you think bethesda games are just "jumping off points", then you probably don't really know what goes into making a game. you can feel free to call them out for not being perfect games, but they are not small-scale by any means.
also you can just buy what you want from other players, no randomness involved.
he also complained that people were treating them like a vending machine, expecting a new elder scrolls and a new fallout all the time. what he doesn't realize is that they are currently closer to a xerox copier. sending out the same thing over and over.
yeah but we can get married too and adopt a child, so i never understood why that would stop them if we still adventure? i guess our character must be a terrible person really
i dunno. it might actually have a chance at release if they never release a new damn es.
the ai handles it just fine, properly concluding "must have been the wind." just the way most arrow injuries happen...
seattle people are offended you suggest they drink crappy coffee.
there is eugene but everyone i've ever met from there acted like they needed a shovel to the face.
lmao so sorry we treat bethesda like a vending machine because we want to buy their fucking products. oh woe is poor bethesda who has soooo many people wanting to buy the games they make, it's just too damn hard for them!
but it's a really shitty xerox copier that keeps sending out worse and worse copies. "oh you liked that copy? here's another one. missing everyword starting with as and no title. oh you're okay with that? alright now this new one doesn't have any periods or the word 'the'. still jerking it at the thought of the newest copy? great. literally half the words are missing now. you'll fucking love it." bethesda gutted fallout but people creamed themselves over it anyways. seriously. there's like 15 quests in the entire game that aren't radiant. combat only looks good in comparison to the old system. the only unique loot is the garbage random loot you get from dead epic enemies. dialogue is pure and utter shit. there's one. one. special check in the entire game. it was turned into aaa generic shit but everyone loved it because it's a bethesda fallout game.
in daggerfall it actually is possible to walk between cities, i once had to do it to complete a quest on time. (it takes less in-game time than fast travel)
what?! seattle the city that is the home of the most famous coffee company in the world is pretentious about their coffee? color me: meh
entirely valid. i edited my post to reflect that point. a small cut is fine in exchange for the platform, mod tools and ease of access. the reason the community is so against paid mods is because of the proportions used in past attempts. when valve tried to implement them into the steam workshop back in 2015, **the modders only got 25% of the profits**, with the remaining 75% being divided between valve and the game publisher.
on the one hand i agree that i wouldn't want elder scrolls to go the "cod" route of pumping out basically shovelware. however, they have the money to hire a team of experienced people to work on a new installation ten times over or outsource it like they did with new vegas so fuck em i guess.
to be fair, i was one of those guys who creamed themselves over fallout 4 on day 1. and day 2. so it took me 48 hours to realize the game was relatively mediocre in the most important ways, but that still earned it a pre-order from myself, and somewhere on the internet there is some praising comments with my name on it.
i feel like 6 years is a long time to wait for a new elder scrolls game. morrowind came out in '02, oblivion in '06, skyrim in '11, and 6 years later, they've announced they aren't even working on another. i realize they want to make other games, but considering just how many people bought skyrim, i'd say there's definitely an audience that's waiting with bated breath for the next game. take us to black marsh, or hammerfell, so much untapped potential in the lore for games in other lands.
i enjoyed it at first too, but then i realized the entire game was built around repetition. not replayability, just repetition. complete these generic radiant quests over and over so you can get loot so you can build a better weapon to do these radiant quests over and over so you can get loot so you can build a better weapon so you can.... they gutted everything else.
"the full arms sale, of over $20 billion, was notified in november 2016. this means it had already been authorized by congress and the executive branch, when president obama was in office, before the trump administration came into office. eventually, qatar is set to receive 36 american-made f15s." neutral guy here providing context.
i think a lot of people here didn't read the article. it looks like the $12 billion of u.s "weapons" is only in the form of f15's, not something you would see isis or other terrorist groups using since it would be easily traceable to this qatar deal and this was approved by congress and the obama administration beforehand. i would have a problem with this if it was something like guns where it could be transferred to these terrorist organizations without much trouble or visibility but it seems like this is a great way to create jobs in the u.s and to provide stability in the region. as much as i don't like trump, this title is just clickbait and the article itself seems to suggest otherwise too.
bill hicks: "go ahead, pick up the gun..." bang. "you all saw him... he had a gun"
*trump put's finger to temple* qatar can't fund terrorism if they spend all their money on us weapons
well, they're going to need those weapons if they're going to stand a chance of fighting saudi arabia, whom trump also recently signed a huge arms deal with. trump's only being fair here, guys.
didn't he fucking flip his lid about obama giving money to iran? money we owed them???
i love these articles that disprove their own headline. what is wrong with our news media?
sometimes i read the comments and realize how uninformed people are on other countries. qatar matters to the usa. they are liberals compared to the saudis. sauce: i lived in qatar
#the full arms sale, of over $20 billion, was notified in november 2016. this means it had already been authorized by congress and the executive branch, when president obama was in office, before the trump administration came into office. you know, since apparently 60 commenters + 350 voters didn't read the article.
you mean trump has wholly accepted the establishment, oligarchy and mic ways? sad for the red states. he was their bernie sanders, the answer to the end of the establishment graft and corruption.
so did qatar actually fund terror? or is that just what the saudis wanted him to say?
"trump sells" authorized by congress and the senate and originally brokered by obama. this sale will create 60,000 jobs in america and alleviate the need for additional us presence in the country. did any of you read the article?
back in my day, when we armed both sides of a conflict, we did it through proxies and back-channels.
i know i'm not the only one who's said this but please read the article. obama did the sale, which was also approved by congress. trump was just in office as they transferred weapons
but but now we can't be outraged! edit- who would have thought one smart ass comment made when half asleep would be my best ever. i wish real life worked like this.
why are we selling f-15s to any country that supports terrorism?
it's sad to see all the misinformation upvoted to the top.
either way, it looks hypocritical. selling arms of any kind to a nation of terrorist sympathizers looks like you're supporting their cause. if anything it's surely strengthening their nation and making it easier for qatar to keep control over their slaves, of which they seem to have many if you look at what's been happening with the stadium builds for the world cup. you're right to point out what you have, but i don't think it matters entirely, the fact is he's giving them power, a nation like that with more guns and power to control is not a good thing edit, spelling
im not a smart man so correct me if this doesnt warrant a "thanks obama"
why the fuck should that be beyond halfway down the article?
"we looked at the receipt. as soon as that check clears we're going on."
this is the third bill hicks quote i've seen on reddit today. the universe is trying to tell me something...
trump is a ridiculous hypocrite but this will only be shocking to people living under a stone all this while
did he check before the transaction if $12 billion was *all* their money?
gotta supply the proxy wars to keep the cash rolling
mother fucking. . .whatever . . i keep thinking that i'm done being shocked.
trump: "what do you mean i'm a hypocrite, qatar is funding *me* now. this is how you negotiate! oh how the turn tables..."
and he just got 12 billion of their money....see, this is how trump "thinks"...
the article says that this deal was actually approved during obama's administration by both the congress and the executive branch. i can't stand trump but it doesn't even look like this was his decision. i wonder what it takes to even pull out of it.
ha!! good luck... they just read the title and jump on the trump hate wagon. don't get me wrong hate on him when its due. but this is not on him.
his actions have shown that he's planning the opposite. his *first ever* foreign visit was to saudi arabia and he specifically labelled iran (saudi's main enemy) as evil. it's clear that he's planning on getting pretty involved in the middle east. i think trump is just going to take saudi arabia's side in everything and hope that they can be a stabilizing force. selling weapons to qatar isn't a huge deal because they're probably going to fall in line eventually. they're far too small to stand up to saudi arabia.
yes, it was authorized by both branches last november, but the deal wasn't actually agreed upon or formalized with qatar until 2 months ago. so, yes. he's still contradicting himself.
many trump supporters voted for him thinking he would deal with arab countries differently, and stop tolerating their bullshit. he now seems to be tolerating all of them as long as they cut checks. keep in mind most of the people that voted for him are not redditors who subscribe to /r/the_donald. maybe his already tenuous support base will begin to erode with continuous news like this
i was shocked to see the truth at the top. i was expecting to either scroll for an hour or sort by controversial.
but now try boiling down all of what you just said into a snappy headline.
yea, both deals with qatar and saudi arabia are a bit dumb but at the same time both deals are for high grade military equipment like ships, aircraft, helicopters and the like. not billions in guns. also, if isis is all of the sudden sailing around in an american made ship, it's pretty easy to know which country to blame at that point.
a country that can't defend itself with their military will defend itself some other way.
the same reason people deal with human rights violators, such as the usa. it's not as simple as you want it to be.
if qatar is legitimately funding terrorism, should we be selling them fucking anything? least of all fighter jets, considering that them funding terrorism should basically make them our enemy?
damn, i am so worried about the media. everything is so spun out of control i don't know what to believe anymore. i'm no fan of trump but what happened to news being about facts? now instead we have click bait and misinformation running rampant. i just wish i could know whats going on without having to spend hours wading through this garbage to get to the facts.
i think it was in the same bit where he said "iraq incredible weapons, incredible weapons." "how do you know that?" "well...we looked at the receipt..." .... ... .. .. "but as soon as that check clears, we're going in!"
why the fuck did that have an evil laugh layered over the video about 2/3 of the way through?
did anyone actually watch this video? wtf was up with that exorcist demon face right in the middle of it?
probably that bill hicks was an amazing comedian and it's sad he's not with us here today. i just referenced him myself recently in some comments.
not sure it matters. people with $12 billion worth of weapons have ways of finding more money.
do you hear yourself? he didn't have a problem with reversing obama's decision to sign the paris climate accord. or to reverse obamacare. but breaking a deal of a 20 billion dollar sale to a country he personally accused of supporting terrorism? no can do, pal!
but he could have changed it and cancelled it (like obama with leaving iraq). if trump is going to take credit for jobs that were actually given out under obama, why shouldn't he get credit for this?
i'm a big obama fan, and hate trump, but the first thing i thought when i saw this was "that deal was signed long ago."
no no, we're fighting the war to defeat terrorism, promise! /s
what continues to shock me is that people still support him. apathy is easy to understand, because at its core it's just a lack of any effort to care. but people who actively support him? of course a person can support anyone they want, but what could a person want from trump that they could trust he would actually deliver? this is just another example of trump being such a hypocrite that you could hardly trust anything he says, yet his supporters remain unfazed. it baffles me.
that's how my mom felt when she saw my report cards in school. she didnt think it could get any worse. until i dropped out of college.
why would any of this shock you? this is all standard, maybe with a bit of uncommon bravado but all standard.
it pretty much _is_ how he negotiates, though. remember back when campaigning how he said he was going to label china a currency manipulator? then he kinda buddied up to china in regards to north korea.. and now his patents are approved, etc. he did this with saudi arabia, too. during the campaign he said they "blew up the world trade center" and wants "women as slaves and to kill gays." now he's making multi-billion dollar deals with them.
you can't use money to fund terrorism when you use it to buy weapons from america. /thinks
tbf just because it was authorized doesn't mean he was obligated to follow through. he could've cancelled the sale. repercussions of which being, qatar is annoyed. but qatar was already annoyed when he started banging on about them funding terrorism.
so what you're saying is everything the previous administration had lined up the current administration has to follow through with?
i don't know but it'll be interesting to see in the next 10 years where a new manufactured threat is created, allowing us access to set those countries 'free'.
it'll be fun to watch in the next 10-15 years the result of this, another manufactured terror group. but at least it'll give us access to new countries for us to set them 'free'.
dude, second paragraph talks about how it was signed this wednesday by mattis. trump could have stopped this. but the article also says that the deal will take years and "they are confident" that qatuaris will meet the demands of the usa before they get the arms. still doesn't look very good, and people are upset about the mercurial nature of this presidency.
so.. does trump get "credit" for the sale or not, for better or worse?
i'm confused. is qatar the bad guy or the good guy now?
yeah truth was posted 4 hours after the article went up, so 7 hours of lies people got fed who aren't coming back to read the comments
saviours of the day: how the u.s. prevented terrorism by selling its obsolete weapons to qatar for 68,698,690.67 ethereum!
not to mention pretty easy for us to render that ship an artificial reef. sorry but a few ships and aircraft don't automatically make you a powerhouse. especially when those aircraft are a little outdated.
so the only solution to roving bands of rival factions is to give overwhelming force to one side and hope they're good people? or do we not care about that second part?
paul mooney had one on the chappelle show years later as negrodamus 'negrodamus, why was president bush so sure iraq had weapons of mass destruction" "because he has the receipt"
yeah, but it's trump. that means he will probably invade iran instead, because he clearly can't spell or type.
it's a theme throughout the special. he's extremely cynical. i highly recommend watching the whole special
perhaps by marking them up and selling to various factions. just like drugs, but with military weaponry.
you don't cancel a $20 billion contract quite that easily, though.
the post gets a lot more upvotes and eyeballs if it automatically puts the onus on trump without actually delving into the actual article content. no matter the feelings for or against trump, this is a big part of what this sub is now. it's not efficient or fact based, but more of let's make comments based on a biased post header without actually reading the whole article first. nobody is the wiser if we all can't even read the damn article before commenting, and making comments based of off one person's bias towards the article and those involved. may as well be sheep.
but the administration could have blocked it. so if team trump was held accountable for what they said and did by themselves and their supporters it wouldn't be happening.
just like the rest of his hypocrisy that is looked the other way?
they don't hear about this kind of thing. the right-wing propaganda network is very selective about what they let their people see, and nothing gets out that is potentially negative until they have put a spin on it and unified behind the message.
i guess if you just want to piss off the "other side" he consistently delivers.
at this point they are in too deep. unless they actively see trump choke a baby to death they will call everything else lies or 'misinformation'. they don't respond to papers or texts, tweets, or official announcements. at this point the extreme trump supports will only respond to direct, hard evidence they can see and touch. like for example getting increased taxes or less income, or their healthcare taken away they rely on. which eventually will happen. and even then there will be a lot who will turn a blind eye... in a sense it's amazing how much a human will and can fool itself to continue to live their life in ignorance and blame others but themselves. literally anything but to be proven wrong.
it's never too late to go back. maybe switch majors and do something you like.
to be fair, he's doing a much better job at destroying the us than al qaeda or isis.
trump is a guy who loses $1000 (total) at a casino but cashes out $200 at the end of the night thinking he is ahead. or wins 50 cents on a dollar spin and thinks he is a shrewd biznesman.
yeah if you are in the business of selling weapons. fucking war sucks. crazy extremists have in one way or another caused almost every damn war in history. sick of this shit. can't everyone just leave each other the fuck alone, live your life, pay your bills, love your family, and do the things you love without killing people? is it really that hard for people to not be greedy douchebags?
i mean, yeah. he could have said "no, they're terrorists," or whatever else he pulled out his ass that morning. but he went ahead with it, despite still saying they're terrorists. so yeah. he gets the credit.
let's be real, some people just want to rage at trump. some media companies deliver. sad to see the fox news business model spilling over.
i wouldn't say they're obsolete, but their age is showing in their primitive stealth technologies. the f15 is still one of the most formidable fighters ever built. military aircraft don't become outdated as fast as other technologies do.
you just explained the us policy in the middle east since the cold war. it's the main reason isis gained the power that it has today.
where the everything is made up and the votes don't matter.
paul mooney is a complex individual. his standup is funny as hell though.
wouldn't iraq have the receipt if they bought weapons from the united states?
just curious, what does random demon face have to do with being cynical?
never stop being shocked at the appalling. it's logical to be appalled at what he's done.
you definition won't see anything like this on t_d. if you post it, you'll receive a prompt ban immediately.
on top of that this stuff is generally disregarded as "fake news" if they do happen to see it outside propaganda networks.
hell, when they were talking about the new health care plan, they interviewed a trump supporter who would lose his coverage. he said something along the lines of "we all have to make sacrifices for the good of the country."
no, that baby was going to be the next hitler. thanks, donny!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ and also high school grades
under the current economic model? next to impossible. you're pitted against your neighbor for a decent-paying job - in what world is that going to produce love for your neighbor? our entire society revolves around competition starting in school where we have class ranks. none of this breeds community or solidarity. it breeds contempt.
no worse than the saudis, this is just a regional power play.
it's really simple. create a headline that caters to one side. hide the truth somewhere in the middle of a paragraph near the bottom. people who like the headline will share it on social media, generating tons of clicks. by the time people break down the truth of the article, the article already has enough views to be profitable. the news company also is safe from fake news allegations, because they did include the partial truth. it only has a misleading headline and intro. that's journalism 101.
this is why a 5000 year old archer can annihilate an aircraft carrier and 4 tanks in civ without breaking a sweat.
before the cold war actually, i'd argue since around 1937 when the us discovered the saudi oil fields and propped up ibn saud to ensure a stable empire and a steady supply of oil. that kind of started our strategy of "back the strongest tribe to create stability" in the region. someone with more knowledge of the region and time, can probably correct me.
nothing matters anymore. it doesn't we've gotten to the point where his defenders are defending him with "he's incompetent so it couldn't be illegal", "it's not technically illegal", and "what's wrong with us being friends with russia. do you want world war three?" this is the fucking president of the united states can we hold him to some kind of higher standard than he doesn't know what he's doing? either he did do things that are illegal or he's incompetent either way he shouldn't be president.
just frame it as trump making a great deal for america, bringing in 12b in revenue!
the nice thing is the sub makes it really easy to pick out awful people. since they ban anyone that says anything even slightly critical of trump, even if it's factual, you can be reasonably certain anyone posting there is a shithead or troll. i have them all mass tagged in res, a list i remake each month to account for people that "come around" and quit posting there. it's not something i would do for any other sub, but because they clean out anyone that isn't a trump supporter, it works for them. and there's a whole lot of patterns you start to notice once you have trump supporters tagged.
well we all do have to sacrifice so that millionaires and billionaires can get richer. i mean, we actually do have to.
just looked up average temps. glad to confirm arizona is the american temperature equivalent to qatar. it's fackin hot here.
i used to think the problem with impeaching trump would mean replacing him with the nefarious pence. at this point i think pence, as horrific as he is, would actually be an improvement.
the hardcore right have always been the whiniest crybabies of any political group. the donald worshippers are the upper echelon of that elite group.
recently a guy posted a pre-made res td poster list, and of course td compared it to jews being tattooed during the holocaust.
ah just getting rid of that old commie fightin stock tying up inventory
go feel the humidity in qatar, then we'll talk. arizona is basically maine when it comes to qatar lmao.
plus we should get to see the look on trump's face when he is impeached!
a large portion of them literally banded behind trump because they were tired of "pc" culture, which, granted, some extreme sides of it had gone off the deep end of outrage culture, but it's even simpler - they were tired of being called racists and bigots, even though that's an observational definition of their views and behavior.
"dave, seriously man, wish it away!" "i wish i were a bird!"
it's rare something in /r/funny is actually funny and original!
thank god i started drinking cucumber water this morning instead of my regular coffee. lpt: cucumber water going through the nose soothes allergy flared sinuses fairly well. smells kind of good too.
this is great! i hope you can post more of these op.
i'm just really happy to find out dinosaurs spoke english.
what a dick. because of him the dinasour who wanted a fresh start for the planet earth got his wish come true :(
we say that this is a rare event, but this is the 4th time i've seen this comment on an /r/funny thread in the past 2 days
the real lpt is always in the comments. brb, choking on some cucumber water.
is this real advice? if so how do you take it though the nose
as the fame of op grows over time, the pressure on him equally heightens. until one day op is consumed by the anguish that he will never make an original piece as great as his first. defeated by his inner demons, he browses the top posts of the year on funny and submits them again... hoping to feel how he felt the first time.
oh lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz? my friends all drive porsches, i must make amends. worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends. so lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz?
its translated for those of you who do not speak dino.
fossil comics like these always fuel my imagination.
i feel like this is the top comment of every other thread in /r/funny
this! this right here is why we can't have nice things!
it's funny how i've never watched an episode of "better call saul" but i know exactly where that is from.
he is saying that he laughed and his cucumber water came out his nose, he is glad it wasn't coffee as that would've hurt quite a bit.
lets' wrap this up before someone comes through and absolutely rex this pun thread
let's just hope that imagination is clean not dirty
i'm starting to think that comments like op are the reason schools are trying to teach critical thinking now. because i didn't get it at all until you explained it.
well at least they knew climate change wasn't hominoid-made.
i was petroling reddit looking for something funny like this.
just checked it out, can confirm. we need more people to check though, for scientific integrity or whatever.
fun fact: cows play a huge role in global warming. cows eat plants and grass, which are difficult to digest. fortunately, they have a four-chambered stomach, so the food they eat it initially digested in the first two chambers. then, they bring up this digested food and chew it again before passing it on to their stomach and intestine to digest a second time. one of the microbes in the digestive system that breaks down their food produces methane as a byproduct. and no, this isn't a fart joke. it's for real.
oh what the fuck does is that now, then? orgasm? fellatio? i can't keep up with you god damn kids. in my day we just had "cowgirl" and "donkey punch" and you knew what things meant. when i bent your grandmother over the couch . . .
another fun fact: vegans smell bad because they don't let the cows do the farting for them.
proof vegans are doing more harm to the planet than good
the world bonding harmoniously in such a way that you can feel its warmth.
what? that's the exact opposite if we're talking about cows.
*chinese* cows. they can't be trying to take our coal jobs if they aren't chinese.
they spread those asinine rumors to trick us into not eating them. nice try cows!
they aren't eating the cows, so they are keeping the population up and therefore harming the planet
is the blue orange contrast that natural, or was it touched up at all? i don't imagine it's super edited, it's just so perfect. the morning light, the reflections, the way the sunlight blends with the ocean mist. really well done.
good job cropping out the group of naked guys playing volleyball at 5am off to the right!
thats awesome. do you know what they are fishing for? i visited san francisco in february 2014 and didn't see anyone fishing on that beach, just a dude naked from the waist down jogging on it
wow ... i can't believe now pretty sf is. good job man, if you don't mind, i'm going to use as my wallpaper
growing up in san diego i always thought sf would be drab like seattle. once i moved to the bay area i fell in love, especially with sf. i am now moving inland to az soon and this picture has me all choked up. i will be leaving with a heavy heart.
no matter how many photos are shot of the golden gate bridge, it never ceases to lose its beauty.
hey i love baker beach it has the best view of the golden gate bridge in all of sf in my opinion
nice shot, but getting up at 5 isn't very special..
omg i woke up at 5am to take a picture, your life is so hard.
why is it so sunny? i live close to san francisco but it is dark at 5 am
it's probably not but it looks like there's a person about to jump from the bridge right above the fisher man's pole
must be a painting. *zooms in* .......wow. that's an awesome photo.
funny how a painting that looks like a photo is also a compliment.
i thought for sure it was digital! looks like something from breath of the wild.
i feel like he used a 28mm but i could be wrong, my reasoning is that it feels wide but only looks slightly distorted
one thing that i find weird is that how despite editing becoming ubiquitous in digital photography, there's what seems to be more resistance from photographers discussing that aspect of their trade than the rest (technical settings, framing etc). it's weird, because, here's this tool that everyone uses to improve their photographs, but rarely mention it upfront or discuss which methods they used.
definitely edited - the blue sky in the top corner is 100% a photoshop gradient.
most likely done using the lightroom camera calibration settings. if you slide the blue to -100 and the red to +100 it will give these exact teal/orange colors.
and that one who always wants to talk to people just walking by.
i recently moved to az from the sf bay. i miss the bay sometimes, but az is so relaxing and there's so much to do. it's not too far either!
try living in north carolina... i've wanted to visit san francisco my entire life, but it's so god damn expensive.
hey seattle's quite pretty in the summer... when it's not cloudy...
ikr. i wake up at 5, six days a week. it's really not that bad. i don't get why people add how much effort they put into the picture they took. i could say i spent 23 years for this one photo! and it's a god damn dick pic.
what if it's a photo of a painting that looks like a photo?
that's exactly what i thought too! i wonder if that fisherman happened to know he was standing in the perfect spot.
maybe youre just an extremely good painter and try to fool us with this "photography" you liar
how about posting the raw file? i'd really love to see more detail of the sky even if it means the edges of the bridge stand out a little less. thanks!
what can you catch in that spot? or ocean fishing from the shore at for that matter..?
do you think it's a 28mm on a full frame sensor? just wondering because i thought it matters.
the editing is pretty much what puts the "professional" in professional photography. the editing, and taking the required shots for the editing anyway. i think it's just as impressive, photography is an art, it's about capturing an image and processing it to look as close to real as possible, that's what it's always been.
i find it odd as well. as someone who started in film photography and spent a good amount of time in the darkroom, post processing has always been a huge part of my workflow. a raw photo is just that...raw. it is just a collection of sensor data displayed in your screen. it is dull, lifeless, and in need of care. obsessing over a raw image straight from your camera is like a film photographer showing off his film negatives instead of his prints. jpegs straight out of camera on the other hand are just raw images that the camera *has processed for you*. taking away all creative control. this is like a pro film photographer going to get his prints from a 1-hour photo instead of spending time enlarging the prints on his own in a dark room. again, giving away all creative control.
actually the blues were already there, i just brought up the vibrancy and got the hue i liked with the hsl.
nah, it's to non-uniform for that, i think he just tinkered with the hsl-sliders. the colors are amazing though.
stop me if you can - *the bomb has been planted*
i really, really, really, really like this image.
i've lived in az my whole life. i can't comprehend this statement. relaxing? what?
regular flights to san francisco from rdu starting up by the end of the year. should be around under $400 round trip from what i've been told.
the fisherman got up at 4 a.m. to stand in the perfect shot.
it kinda looks like he was with op as there is another fishing pole stuck in the sand (but i could be wrong).
95% of the time, even if someone shoots on a crop sensor, they'll still speak in terms of full frame equivalents.
precisely. i have never understood that, and i wish i could see more photographers talking about their editing techniques.
i would've killed you if it weren't for this meddling 64 tick server!
if you're driving into the city at 3:30 am i don't imagine it's ever too bad
no fucking way. i'm 20 minutes from rdu. thank you so much for telling me.
actually it's just one photo. the distortion you see on the sand is from an edit i did to it on my phone.
did you freaking shoot this with a phone? it's magnificent. if so, which one?
if i have to upvote any more of these fish puns, i swear to cod...
i belted out laughing, that was hilarious. what the hell did he launch himself off of to get that rifle-bullet trajectory??
i love it when a dog is so amped up they end up knocking me on my ass. it's hysterical.
that was like a 100lb wet log flying through the air. absolutely horrifying if you don't know that log is also your best friend.
ok before anyone yells repost, this genuinely made me laugh out loud and i have yet to see it before. just let some fun things be fun pls.
does anyone have a video source with sound for this?
why do dogs do this exactly? it's like they're all spirit and no awareness of their own bodies.
i know i'm getting old because the first thing i thought of was "her parent's wood floor though...."
i can't stop laughing at this. thank you, op. i've never seen this before and i've had a shit week. i needed this.
it's like they don't know they're 80 pounds and made of bones
we call my buddy's lab the "meat-seeking missile" because he has railed people in the nuts more than once.
when i was a kid, we had a beautiful chocolate lab with an overactive zoomy circuit. he'd get going and launch himself through the air in this amazing ballistic trajectory and slam himself broadside into the back cushions of the sofa. sometimes he'd hit so hard the sofa would rock onto its back two legs and nearly fall over. we'd all crack up, and this of course would egg him on and fuel the zoomies. man i miss that dog. he was legit my best bud from fourth grade until my junior year of high school.
my first thought as well. dogberg with the spear out of nowhere!!
why is it called "dogberg"? obviously it's a play on words, but i don't get it.
she was running away from him and he launched himself to catch her. too funny!
imagine how scary wolves were 10000 years ago. no wonder we hid in caves.
yeah but it made someone else laugh before and they can't laugh at the same thing twice
but that's the thing.. wood floors tell a story...
when my german shepherd was growing and gotten into the floppy eared faze he did this all the time. it sucked sinse he was around 70 to 80 pounds then. when we would open the gate to our backyard he would immediately shoot straight like a rocket to your stomach and nether regions. lucky for us he stopped doing that once he got older. good thing too since he currently ways around 110 to 115 pounds.
you can see a smirk on his face after he dodged the first shoe, like "yeah motherfucker, i'm too fast"
how badass would it have been if he caught the shoe and threw it back?
man i love that gif. if he had caught the second shoe one-handed and stared the guy down, it might have been the most badass moment in recorded presidential history
no. considering the weight of the dog (let's say 90 kg) and the distance that is thrown (~300 meters), the launch mechanism couldn't be anything but a trebuchet.
~~unrelated, but is that really how the admins wanted all of reddit to look? holy shit, it's awful. i'm so glad they reversed their decision on css, it just looks like i'm trying to view a mobile page on my phone. nothing is anywhere that makes sense.~~ false alarm, it's a custom made theme called reddit redesigned. it looked so similar to the new profiles i thought they'd been rolling it out already.
not only does it hurt but it'll rack up the medical bills to boot. my pit ran full speed to jump on the bed just as i was picking something up and collided with my head. created a psuedo tumor, blurriness in my right eye, caused by increased pressure to the optic nerve. this also caused severe migraines. after several mri's/ct scans i was put on diamox or something for a few years to relieve the pressure. it's finally gone and i'm back to normal. silly pup had no idea what she did, but it's okay because i wouldn't trade her for the world.
rolls over your neighbor's dog. what's great for a snack and fits on your back? it's log, log, log.
how come you misspelled the word "since" at first, but got it right the second time you used it?
not 100% sure but i think i remember reading at the time that that's supposed to be a major insult in that culture.
despite most of wrestling being show, that looks like it would seriously hurt. ddp's head ragdolls when he gets hit. also the ref does an amazing job selling his shock.
it is hilarious that people unaware of trebuchet memes apparently have no problem with finding 300 meters of clear space inside a house but more annoyed by a supposedly 90kg labrador lol
(let's say 90 kg) do you realise how much 90 kg is? i'd be surprised if it weighs even half of that.
i sorry but where did you find that it's what the admins wanted reddit to look like? it just looks like a theme made by a user to me.
you've brightened countless people's days on here man. for being a novelty account, the value of your words makes you no mere novelty, friend. have a summer as awesome as you are!
hey that's my life philosophy!!! i am single in my mid 30's with a decent job and a fantastic dog. while sometimes i get lonely or moan that i'm the only income source, i remember that i also have the freedom to do whatever makes me happy. and i do just that. try to live every day like that. as long as i enjoy it and i'm having fun/happy doing it, then it is worth my time. makes for a mostly happy life! i say mostly because we are human and are going to have days where life sucks.
this would be a great post in one of the revenge subs.
well the good doggo checks on the lil baby right afterwards so i think you're all good to laugh at it.
they say a lot of those moves take a toll on their bodies. they do have certain ways of landing that makes it hurt less, though. apparently they spend a lot of time practicing falling. now if only they could work on making punches seem more realistic and stop that stomping shit. (if they still do that, it has been years)
~~because it's identical to the new reddit profile design.~~ i was wrong.
you know who else was good to his community? gacy.
i walked away from my phone after reading your comment, and couldn't stop laughing for like 5 minutes while trying to get dressed. just wanna thank you for brightening my day with no need for a philosophy lesson. just a question with no question mark. i'm sure i'll be laughing the rest of my day.
i went back and to the left of it to see if there was anything else he could have done. but he really hit the nail on the head
the lack of respect in this thread is mind blowing.
it appears that everyone here is an expert on sail
"buns confusing day" is a children's book i'd read
my cat likes to dance. ...well "to be danced with" more precisely. and by "likes" i mean "has no choice but to when i'm drinking".
that's a freaking adorable name for a cat. i'm stealing it
damn, well done op. i've been on the internet since the dark days of aol dial-up, muddled through the message board era, watched the rise of e-commerce (remember that buzzword?), and the monolithic rise of google and facebook. this is the 1st time i've seen such a picture in 20+years of internet usage. i've seen a lot of cats, girls, dancers, and pictures of beaches. but never before such a masterful combination of all 4. sincerely, thank you for this.
do you have the cat on a leash when you take it to the beach? i ask because if you didn't, i'm wondering how you would get her* to come back to you. it's not like a dog where you can give it commands, right? or am i totally wrong?
"i am a kitty cat, and i dance dance dance. and i dance dance dance."
people are going to fap to this, then feel shame. i guarantee it.
i can't imagine this convo going "honey, grab the cat and lets go to the beach!"
"sand on my paws and sand on my tail, where is this you've bought me?" i ask with a meow. shh says my human. just dance, look amused. i remind myself later to poop in his shoes.
i love those books! "buns in space" "buns goes to the zoo" and "buns rides again" are some of my favorites. the series got a little weird after "buns first anal fissure" however . . .
i can assure you he does have a choice. source : my cat does not allow you to drunk dance with her.
i call things like this petly duties. i like to put my cat under my sweatshirt with her head poking out the top. my wife hates the term, but i think it's appropriate...
water, sand, wind? seems like a cat will surely enjoy the beach
i had a 2 year old rescue cat that had no teeth and kidney disease, so for her bucket list we went to different parks (the kind with trails) and the beach once too. she was so friendly, not afraid of new places or people, and walked like a dog without needing a leash...just a happy girl. she was one of the best cats i'll ever have. i miss you callie xoxo
haha thank you! do it! some good variations that she also doesn't respond to are bunsiewoo, bun bun face and the bundertaker :)
she has a harness and a leash but, she's not very fast and in this case preferred to stay in her carrier facing away from the water. did not care where her tuna comes from.
i have been scrolling for so long, i had almost lost hope that someone else would be reminded of this.
is it my buns? the pic was taken in oregon but she used to live in mn.
hahaha i found out a few months ago my best friend grew up thinking those were the lyrics, so for her birthday i bought her a "hold me closer tony danza" t-shirt. i had no idea people thought this way until she said something.
"sand on my paws and sand on my tail, where is this you've brought me? it's coarse and rough and irritating and gets everywhere".
yeah, but *buns contemplates the inherent meaninglessness of existence* was post-*anal fissure* and it's my favourite book in the series
my cat would make a third hole in your nose with his claws the moment you try that shit.
when i let my cat outside the first thing he does is roll around in the dirt. i believe he is a dog stuck in a cats body.
i could imagine my cat twisting around in that until the collar starts tightening around his neck. then he'd go into one of those cat panic attacks where he is screaming and flinging his claws everywhere.
if bundertaker fell 19 feet onto a table, she would probably land on all fours and be ok.
okay, i gotta ask because now you've mentioned her being in a carrier. why did she go to the beach with you? is it just because you like her near you? i'm legitimately curious. i was thinking you brought her to the beach to go for a walk or something.
it's also a joke on friends. phoebe thinks these are the lyrics as well.
usually it's left somewhere you're guaranteed to step on it, and around my house it's puke.
my friends call me boring because gin & tonic is my drink of choice... but it's so refreshing!!!
i like to think gin is the cocktail alcohol, but its really good with just passionfruit juice
i can't read a sentence that starts with "the neverending" without singing the whole thing like the "neverending story" theme song. it works even better than i dared dream for this.
i had a cat that was a reformed barn kitty. we kept her inside, but every once in a while she'd make a break for the door, only to flop over the second she got to grass.
unless you know the exact title, good luck ever finding it again. especially because repost bots use the same damn title :(
it's not that easy with google either, and don't even try to find specific comments ... that is really something the staff could seriously improve upon.
cats have a non-lethal terminal velocity, so as long as they have enough time to orient themselves to land feet first, they could fall a hundred feet and be ok.
when you have a cat, you like to expose them to new and exciting opportunities. sometimes they like it, sometimes they don't. my cat hates being outside, but figured out she could be outside on the porch with the birds but still feel safe. now she runs for the porch door when she hears it open. i would bring her everywhere if i could cuz i love her so much but she doesn't want to go everywhere. i also wish she could text me but you know...
now you gotta ask yourself, did the misconception come first or did friends start it? or ask google. whichever. just let me know what you find out
my cat just manages to fling half of his litter all over our spare bathroom floor. every day i'm sweeping at least $3 worth of unused litter. he is so darn cute tho i can't be mad :)
my dad's old cat would piss through a small hole into the back of his amp for revenge. they're calculated lil' fuckers.
my cat had a pacing problem when eating. she would eat too much too quickly causing her to vomit so we cut down her portions to 1/3 and added one extra feeding time. this pretty much solved the problem.
just going to point out, careful if your cat seems to vomit randomly and it has undigested food or is even just water. my cat had this problem, my mom wouldn't take him to the vet at the time because she was busy with her new boyfriend and family drama and by the time i got the funds to get him looked at, his condition plummeted very suddenly and he died. still need to scatter his ashes.
puke is a regular occurrence in my house too, but mum wouldn't listen when i insisted on a dog instead.
it's healthy. lime for scurvy. quinine for malaria. gin kills bacteria. so when people say it's boring, tell them it's a matter of good health.
throw in a twist of lime and that's a damn refreshing beverage for sure. although, i haven't had one in over a year. pretty stoked about that tbh. (recovering alcoholic here) guess i'll stick to lemonade and ice water. at least i know i won't get arrested drinking that... edit- just wanted to say that i was blown away with the support that popped up from this. i wasn't expecting that, and it was a really nice surprise. i'd also like to share with any who may be struggling with alcohol or drug use/addiction. there is help out there. you just have to take the first step/initiative. it can be hard to admit your problems to yourself, let alone to others. it is worth it though. you - are - worth - it!
i was online in a supermarket in 1988 with lemons lime and tonic. an old man said very directly youre going to get in a fight tonight! he was right and i had to stop drinking a few months later. is that true about gin?
it's actually super easy to find something if you google the key words and add "reddit" in there somewhere. it works surprisingly well.
also, photo of car litter box. how the hell does that work.
he meows too much to be a dog. unless dogs can learn a second language?
when will cats evolve to have opposable thumbs, damnit!!
oh, i am a cat lover myself! i had four babies up until this year, and now i'm down to two. i just would have never thought to bring them to the beach. i do wish i could bring them to work with me though. i think the day would go by so much faster. if my cats could text me, they would probably just tell on the dogs all the time.
i always sang it that way before the episode. mystery solved.
i don't like sand it's coarse and rough, and irritating too, strangely enough. can't wait to get back to the house with my slave, and stare like i'm quietly digging his grave.
get one of those large clear plastic bins, cut a door into one of the shorter sides, then put the litter box in it. it saves a lot of time and effort.
my cat wastes his litter by trying to eat it. (it's okay, it's yesterday's news litter and our vet said it's safe)
and those litter catching mats are a joke that do not work! i just vacuum every single day.
my dog once ripped open a bag of litter and it was all over the room it was in, the 2 cats then began to poop and pee all over the place in that room while i was at work.
same. i want to buy a covered litter box but i know me, and if i can't see it i won't clean it
notice he said old cat, implying that he ain't around anymore...
putting a tennis ball or something in the food bowl often works too. they have to eat around it, even move it out of the way, so it slows down their eating enough that they don't overeat and vomit. or it just irritates them enough that they say "fuck this shit, i'm not hungry enough to deal with this" and go away until they're hungry again.
so are you saying that time i drank a bottle of gin over the course of a night was healthy for me?
good to know! i too, think of it as a boring choice when my sister & her hubby drink it...every night! perhaps i will imbibe in this good-for-me "medicinal" cocktail!
i bet if you just stuck some juniper berries in your drink it'd sort of be like having gin without the alcohol. i've never tried it but fresh juniper berries smell like how gin smells after the berries are distilled. i bet they'd impart their flavor into your drink. congrats on your sobriety, btw.
idk what that old man was talking about, bourbon is what brings me alllll the black eyes.
i used to have a jeep cherokee and my cat went everywhere with me. i just folded down the back seats and stuck a normal litter tray in there. she was a great little traveller, but she did startle a few fast food employees in the drive-thru.
i'd say any dog that does anything any human asks verbally has learned a second language.
could also have been a popular joke that an older generation had been singing for years, and so friends used it
"have you heard the trag'dy of plagueis the wise?" asked palpatine softly, a gleam in his eyes
this is exactly what we did and it is awesome! totally worth it. now the only scattering of litter comes from the fucker running all over the house and dropping bits from his toes as he goes. it's like little trails that tell me where he's been. kinda like those old family circle comics! lol
why's it gotta be a clear one? besides, it's probably just as cheap if not cheaper to just get a litter box with a top($8-$20) than a large bin ($20-$40). and you'll save money by not filling a huge bin every time.
i'll streamline this comment thread and jump in to saying that your cat probably has a severe brain disorder. as is tradition.
i sometimes intersperse virgin lime tonics in with my g&ts to avoid getting drunker-than-planned when drinking socially, they don't lose as much as you might imagine. i'll have to try crushing a juniper berry in sometime, afik the aromatics in gin are alcohol soluble so they won't extract the same without, but i bet the odor alone would make it mostly work.
it's a sith legend! from long, long ago. it isn't a tale that the jedi would know
i feel like at this point even that phrase is an old meme
wow. that's pretty cool, actually. i could see doing that if you have the space and means. i'm often impressed with the creativity of people.
i didn't know 'all colors at once' was an option for squirrels
do you have a version of this photo without hdr and saturation cranked up? i'm sure it's still a cool picture, i'm just curious how strongly those colors actually contrast in natural lighting.
is it sad that i haven't seen it till now? i'm from kerala.
for a second i thought it was a photoshop but it's really such a thing? cool
its india. their movies are "all emotions and genre at once" and their food is "all spices at once".
only with the exotic fauna dlc, although the travel iaps are a bit pricey.
he has claimed lots of colorful nuts from his travels.
can you add your picture to wikipedia? dear lord, the ones they have are awful.
ayyy kerala :) i miss visiting my grandparents there.. the house boat overnight ride was amazing.
yeah i can't believe nobody else noticed this..look at the green of the trees. the color saturation is cranked way up. every other photo of this kind of squirrel on google without color editing is just brown and red and a little yellow
hella lit i regularly see peacocks crossing the road outside my house, once had 3 sitting on my roof too can't forget the occasional runaway leopard
their weddings are "all emotions at once" too. crying, laughing, serious dad; it's all there.
not all indian food are spicy. we have a wide variety of dishes that span across different regions and cultures. the menu card in a lot of restaurants are printed as a book and not as a single sheet.
i can take you all around kerala. its an awesome place to visit.
op probably also should submit to some photo contests... such an amazing shot!
would they take doctored images? i'm not saying op's picture is doctored. i don't know. it feels like it because i still can't believe the colors myself. but maybe that is the reason why their pictures seem "awful" why this is so great? again, not saying it's doctored, i have no knowledge of that.
also indian uncles coming through clutch with the dad jokes
i hate when there are more then ten choices on a menu lol, but i do love indian food.
the picture is definitely oversaturated. there are blue and red splotches in the tree that definitely shouldn't be there.
every photo ever is processed by the user. even your jpegs on your phone or point and shoot, it's just set to default settings rather than custom like a pro would do. even film prints are processed. it's all just a matter of how much or how realistic the photographer is going for.
jesus, do you people just have fickle digestive systems or are eating junk food all the time? i have never gotten the shits once from indian food, mexican food, etc.
tried "indian food" iam from india and even i cant finish trying indian food with bazillion of dishes with every flavour imaginable on earth.
from what i understand, if you live abroad you only taste a slice of what indian food is, and it's also usually westernised. indian food varies vastly from region to region. the naan and butter chicken stuff is only from some parts of the north. this is not to deny that you've had poor experiences at the restaurants you've visited.
or you need to try more types. india cuisine is huge. most people i hear that don't like it proceed to name just one random thing as the only thing they've ever had.
indian uncles with dad jokes are the reason i attend weddings.
and there's always that one uncle who tries to get you drunk at the wedding even though you're 16.
why do people hate lots of choices on a menu? is it a matter of having too many choices? or because it looks cluttered? i work in an ice cream shop and just over the past 5 years our menu has shrank and shrank, even though we have all the previous items. it seems like a general trend.
new favorite subreddit. let's get this big people.
that's actually a beautiful looking language if i've ever seen one.
onnum illa :p i can't read or write malayalam though :/
i live in a town that's heavily indian, the women around here love that i eat indian food and will just randomly show up with huge containers of biryani and whatever vegetarian dishes they've made.
i thought for a second that was the full name of the dish then realised i'm a retard.
people rarely know the difference. all we hear is people talk about chicken vindaloo or tikka. chicken vindaloo is not even an actual dish in india. unfortunately, most people think indian good is just chicken tikka, paneer (punjabi) or biryani(hyderabadi), which majority of people in india rarely have. based on these dishes, people in us think all indian food is spicy,which is untrue. they rarely know south indian food (tamil nadu, karnataka, kerala - all have unique cuisines), goan food , maharashtrian food ( konkani malwani) or gujarati food (theplas or other dishes of the region which are not spicy at all). if you live in san francisco, austin,new york, chicago, los angeles, dallas or houston, you can actually try all the above options.
not for me, i'm lactose intolerant. tbh i still go in on it. it's just a fucking mess.
i don't either. sometimes i wonder if people just say it a lot because it's a popular/stereotypical thing to say.
i wonder that too. i'm indian, husband is american. he has a varied diet, so he never faces issues like giant shits with my cooking. when we visit his family though.... they eat so little fruit and vegetable that my shits don't come out easy. after that, i concluded it's because americans don't usually eat much fiber, and fiber-rich cuisines like indian and mexican cause them to have normal shits, which feel giant to them.
in u/catsnakechaos 's defence, if every time he's gone to a restaurant whose cuisine is "indian food," and hasn't enjoyed it, it's not an unfair assertion to make. it's how we make up our minds about most things. people often try to push the "but you haven't tried mine!" idea.
it looks like a fire pokemon. what would its name be that doubles as its only speech pattern? possibly singerat? single evolution, into an even more on fire flying squirrel
learn to cook it dude, takes some practice but its dirt cheap to make once you have the spices.
we live in a world where it's popular to pretend to have diarhea
i think it depends on your diet. being ethnically mexican, i grew up eating all kinds of weird shit, so i never had an issue with eating food from india, korea, the philippines or any other place. the only issues i had were after long periods of "vanilla" eating, which i supposed you could define as what you would expect people who lived in a middle class us suburb to eat (where chipotle is as exotic as it gets). going back to really potent ethnic foods after a period of eating like that usually results in a bathroom mud festival.
not all people have a similar digestive system you know, if i eat too spicy i know i'll get the shits. i envy you people who can eat mexican and indian it's *sooooo* good.
i think its part one of those things to say and part what the person you replied to said. when all people eat is potatoes and ham or chicken with barely any spice their digestive systems can't handle all the spicy goodness of foreign food
thank you :3 and yeah i'm sure if i'd visit india and try a lot of the dishes i'll find ones i like a lot.
see, there's the problem - you need to go to edinburg to get the authentic stuuf
you got it, wouldn't trade it for the world, honestly the nicest people i've ever met hindus and muslims alike i'll sit and talk to them for hours one of the joys of working in a library
everyone wants a problem so they can feel special.
i'm a white person who grew up in a middle class suburb and i have a stomach of steel. i love spicy foods and don't have digestive troubles from eating different cuisines. then again, i grew up eating tv dinners, canned vegetables and fast food. so maybe my stomach looked at the heavy spice as a welcome reprieve from the processed garbage i grew up on. i bet my stomach was damn thankful in fact.
i didn't grow up with anything spicy or what some may call exotic, i dunno, my small town midwestern diet growing up has not led me to have issues.
well i haven't asked to be honest... i am sure they would. i would then feel obligated to share back, and i barely cook for myself as it is x.x... so i will continue dwelling in my dark hole, savouring the smell of their amazing food haha
i had diarrhea for years but it was actually just alcoholism! who'da thunk.
it's almost as if gut flora is a wildly diverse microbiological ecosystem and it's different for everyone.
chocolates are absolute enthusiasm machines. that and the fact that they love everybody gives you oh boy! oh boy!
beautiful dog :) labs are my favorite, such wonderful companions. mine will go bonkers for: "go for ride?" "time for swimming?""go visit mom and dad?" "get a chew?" "where are your christmas presents?" and of course "ice cream?" lol
when i reach home and have to use the toilet real bad but first have to talk to the unexpected house guests.
god, i love dogs so much. one of my exes many moons ago had two labs: a yellow and a chocolate. both of them were derps, and the chocolate had hip dysplasia. but the chocolate would also get really jealous every time the yellow lab got attention. the chocolate would put his head between your hand and the other dog's head when giving him pats and whine that he wasn't getting pats. seriously the most adorable thing ever.
my friend has a chocolate lab and i swear it's the most energetic derp.
my sister has a chocolate lab. her dog is 11 years old and still has the energy of a puppy. it's incredible. she's always happy and enthusiastic. i love taking her for walks and to the beach. they love swimming and playing fetch. i love coco. labs are amazing dogs. only thing that sucks is she sheds like crazy. shit gets everywhere.
have you ever met a pitbull/lab hybrid? holy cow, it's like concentrating 8 large dogs worth of dog in one little tiny canine body.
god i read this as "chocolates are absolute euthanasia machines" and i was like why are you talking about the fact that chocolate kills dogs
in contrast, there is no breed of dog more perfectly able to rip your soul to shreds than the black lab. they have perfected the sad; puppy dog eyes.
chocolate more than black or tan? never occurred to ask if there were any personality differences between the colors...
have you seen a doberman before breakfast? increase the speed of this gif by 10 fold and you're in the ballpark of the food dance.
is this particularly true of the chocolate variety (rather than yellow or black)? i only ask because my dog is a lab/husky cross (a so-called siberian-retrevier, for those who need fancy labels). she's white as snow but seems to have all the energy-beans of a lab with all the independence of a husky brain (yeah...she's not allowed off lead during walks).
i put money on this being in tomorrow's trending subs here /r/trendingsubreddits/
i have one and holy shit thats way too accurate. energetic derp machines
we had to put down my 11 year old black lab recently. he was still smiling and friendly even when he was so weak he could barely get into and out of the car. and i still haven't gotten all his hair out of my room yet, i think i'll be a bit sad when i finally find the last few strands of it.
my lab was the same at that age, you never would have known she was technically a senior! we just had to put her down last month - she would have been 17 next week. please treasure your girl!!
i feel like whoever decided to cross breed those two dogs just wanted to see if the resulting puppies could power a small city with their energy.
i have one. she's a lot more chill now that she's getting up in years, but yes. a college house was the best place for a dog like that. i would walk her before class, then right as i got my backpack on to leave, someone else would come home from class and say to her, "ok, doggo, time for your walkies." she got like 8 walks a day. and near-constant ball throwing.
it's just an interesting way to explain an important fact. don't feed your dogs chocolate! also, your comment almost made me die laughing
dachshunds! they have the perfect sad eyes and i cave in literally any time my little doxie girl wants something cause her eyes get me lol
you're so awesome for not cropping your doberman's ears. i hope you and him/her have a lot of happy years together to come.
good news! you'll never hit the end of finding that hair.
i'm sorry to hear about your loss : ( sadness will go away in time but the 11 of happiness will stay with you forever! hugs to you!
sorry for your loss. we put my 13 year old lab down around a year ago. we had the vet visit our house for the procedure so he could relax on his favorite couch with a big bowl of chocolate ice cream while it happened. it seriously feels like you've lost your best friend, but i find some solace in the fact that at least he doesn't need to suffer anymore. he lived a great life, as i'm sure yours did as well. we both did what we had to do; keeping him alive only to prolong our inevitable suffering would have been downright selfish. they may be gone, but their memories live on in everyone whose lives they've touched.
don't feed your dog lots of things, everyone should learn about dogs before owning one...
my dad had no idea when he was a kid. his dog loves chocolate donuts and ate them all the time and died old. he did freak out when he learned out though.
i don't semicolon out of the fear someone will call me out like this, hardcore. but even i had to do a few double takes with that one.
i have a chocolate lab, what the hell kind of black magic was used to be able to get that photo. mine would inhale the treat before you had time to balance it on her snout. oh god what about the drooling.
chocdor! - *heavy metal riff* - the droolinator...
yup. my dog died like 5 years ago and i still keep finding hair from time to time.
thanks a lot. his spirit is with me constantly now, filling me with love even from beyond.
i feel like i know so much about dogs through my years of research, but i could never take the initiative to go adopt one. i just feel like i could never be good enough for what they are.
it's a dobie. your biggest failing is that you fail to feed it the flesh of your enemies at daybreak.
i love it when their ears aren't cropped! they look so cute and goofy
stratagail, sucked into a jet turbine. dynaguy, snagged on take off. splashdown, sucked into a vortex. no capes!
mine died in 1997 (20 years ago) and i still find hair from time to time in the most strange places at home.
if you can't afford it, or afford the time, thank you for being realistic. i volunteer at a shelter and there's almost nothing more depressing than a dog that is there because someone didn't know the responsibility or changed their mind. poor dog bros don't know what the "did wrong " to be ditched.
don't worry about being good enough, your dog will think you are, and that's all that counts.
it's a dog, you're over-thinking it, they mostly take care of themselves. give them food, water and a place to poop and they'll be fine. give them love and attention and they'll be happy.
i read your post 2 days too late. chocolate is widely known to be deadly to dogs but i've never heard about grapes/raisins. my dog ate grapes and i was freaking out after a quick google. it's been 24hrs+ and he seems fine. *cross fingers
we fed our dog the occassional treat of meat aside from his usual dog food. we always had a lot of moose meat in our freezer and the parts that we considered "scraps" were cooked and saved to give him with a bit of dog food every now and then! he never begged but always laid down under the table ready to eat the occassional piece of food falling om the floor. he was also a big fan of pasta so we gave him a few cooked spaghetti when we had pasta! but absolutely no candy, ice cream or anything other than non-seasoned meat and pasta!
agreed. brutus is scary enough when the doorbell rings, but gentle enough when my 10 year old neice tries to ride him like a horse. cropping ears doesn't make sense to me, especially since he's a bush dog.
i can definitely say i still find my great pyrenees' hair, and she died ten years ago. combine that with owning a black lab mix now, and i have to roll around on a giant roll of tape before i leave the house.
in time it will definitely happen. he was a family dog, the responsibility was shared among me and my parents (though i was his main caretaker for the last 4 years). i think the next dog i get will be shared among my future family, hopefully.
and daily walks/exercise, and access to vet care, and proper training, and if the dog is an energetic breed keeping them occupied is pretty important if you don't want all your stuff ruined... you're thinking of cats.
i'm with you on this one. dogs are dogs, not babies. they aren't going to accidentally kill themselves if you leave them alone in a room. you basically just have to not be one of those selfish people who get a dog and think they can go on doing whatever the fuck they want without concern for the dog. a dog is a companion, not an accessory. although, props to /u/pig20 for adopting older dogs. i love people who do that. older dogs deserve love, too.
fucking *got* me. this is the first time that's given me a full on, no holds barred, belly laugh that leaves me hurting a little bit. brilliant.
it did honestly happen though. i just decided since i went through the trouble of typing out the story, i might as well end it somewhere familiar.
does anyone know how to reach him direct? i see his channel is about handheld games. for a period of time abut 8-10 years ago, i went bananas collecting retrogames, including a shit-ton of battery powered handheld games from the 70's and 80's. i cashed out of the vintage nes last year and kinda don't really maintain the handheld collection anymore, would happily send a package his way of some handhelds he might not have. this isn't even a 'charity' impulse as much as it is i see how much he seems to love them relative to how little i gaf about them anymore, so may as well bring some minor joy to a random person.
to the person who donated 800 bucks to this man... you the best... who? you.... *edit* this is now my 2nd most upvoted comment. it was honestly just a way for me to make a dj khaled reference. please stop upvoting it. my #1 post is about tacos. please don't ruin that.
i know he's fully funded, but i still gave $10. i love being part of a community that comes together to help people who are passionate. it's a beautiful thing. this dude seems pretty genuine and 100% deserving.
epic. i just checked the link and he is topping $6,200.00 - i show my girl, and tell her about how this kind of thing happens on reddit every once in a while. the community just goes off the chain for minute and some dudes life gets utterly changed. and here it goes again. then i refresh his fund me page..... in five minutes, it's up $600.00!!! i won't lie, i love it when you fuckers make me cry like this.
i'm just a student with student loans and no money, but have $10. i will buy chicken nuggets from wal-mart instead of getting chick-fil-a for the next two weeks. guarantee those are going to taste better being able to help someone. love this so much in the seemingly mean world we live in.
i just recently came into a large inheritance. i'm late to this but would like to donate a vehicle. how can i find out more information?
don't think i've ever done gofundme but this seemed worth it even after they hit their 'target'. it's not like his cerebral palsy is going away and i'm sure they'll need it. here's $50 man, hope for the best for ya. game on!
is there a link to donate? i'm not seeing anything.
man that made me happy. my son is disabled and we tried to raise money through gofundme for a service dog. unfortunately it's hard to get noticed. felt good to see him so happy.
this is really sweet. today has been an emotional day for me, a family friend passed away from brain cancer, leaving behind her husband and 1 year old son. she was an incredibly positive person, and spread a lot of joy in spite of her own suffering, and i don't know. it just makes me feel better knowing that there is goodness in the world, and that people can come together to lift others up. thanks for posting this op.
20k$ !!!! averaging 1000$ / 5 minutes right now! keep it up reddit!!!
just donated $10 to the gofundme. it's not a lot, but hope it helps this awesome guy move forward with the tough hand he's been dealt.
someone's basic needs should not be funded by fucking charity. fuck the us for denying his rights to healthcare and dignity.
can this be verified? there was a huge scam years ago on reddit of a gamer faking being in a wheelchair so people would give him money and video games.
jesus man, shoot a video at least of this for youtube. you need exposure for this act and i seriously doubt anyone would mind. great job and thanks for helping.
we are here to help. looking forward to a new video tomorrow. that's all i ask!
don't know where you're located, but i work for an airline and could fly to you, and drive it to him for free! (always wanted to road trip, why not for a good cause, and i'll cover gas!)
i'll swap the motor i'm next door to cinci. i'll pay for the motor. source: own car dealership/repair facility
i saw 2 $500s since then, those individuals are worth noting as well.
i'm in a similar situation, i donated $200 and have been enjoying the excitement he displays on stream.
can you post this in the gaming subreddit too? i know they are incredibly supportive of their community members. i don't really know how the reddits works though, maybe its already been done. in which case ignore my frivolous antics.
astoundingly we are currently talking with someone who owns a car dealership who is fixing the van for free. thank you so much for the offer though, your generosity, along with everyone else who's donated, has left our family speechless!
he's been slow playing it for 9 years and he's ready to strike!
he has cerebral palsy and i don't think anyone would fake it this accurate and post hundreds of videos with small number of views for 9 years just for 5000 dollars :/
with just 10 minutes or less of your own research you can figure out just how genuine this guy is.. i've only spent a few minutes on his channel and would be willing to bet a year's salary that he is honest and definitely needs some help.
i'm sure we'll get video, but only of kevin, i'm not interested in exposure. i only want to help. :)
it will, i just need to get him to contact me and i'll go pick it up before the weekend. i need to talk to him to know what his van is so i can order the engine.
thank you. kevin says "there definitely will be a new video tomorrow". :)
new video tomorrow is going to be of him at $40k+ and i just cannot wait. i can only imagine the amount of grateful joy that spreads through their hearts when they check again in the morning and see that. it's just phenomenal. i feel good just thinking about it and that alone was worth my piddly $5.
thank you so much. i asked if he had anything to say and he is practically speechless :) he says that it all hasn't sunk in yet that this is happening, and that the support he's received from youtube/reddit has blown him away. "my channel is relatively small so i didn't expect it to get this much exposure". you all have made our night. practically none of us can sleep because we are all in shock :)
if this happens make a vlog of it so everyone can follow along on your adventure!
upvoted to get people to see your comment and then see his.
username does not check out lol. i agree. good to see the love in this thread.
it's lukas guys! also hey i didn't really do anything i just saw someone in need and i tried to help out. i wish i could help everyone but hey i can't do that. i do really enjoy the reddit community when we all come together like that. i just wish we could do that as a country more often.... now enough of my ramblings guys. keep donating to this amazing human! let's try to make his whole year!
do you know what makes it special? i have to do a senior design in the upcoming year and if i can make something to reduce the cost of this or turn normal cars into wheelchair accessible ones for a fraction of the cost, i'd like to see what i can do. sure i can research it, but you seem to have superior knowledge than me. seems like a good starting point.
i posted the original at r/gaming but mods have locked it because they said it is not gaming related :/
we need to get the media to pick this one up and send it into orbit. it's got all the makings a great feel good piece.
i have bamboozle insurance, because i've seen some shit.
incredibly moving.. care to drop your business name so we can support it?
your brother definitely has an interesting personality and i think he will retain a lot of his new viewers (including me!), thanks for the update!
hey, dont know if you noticed but this guy /u/tritonv8guy has offered you to help you with the van and he is in ohio too. make this happen :d
seriously! nothing makes me happier than seeing people helping people. we all have to deal with negativity and horrible people on a daily basis. stories like these affirm my belief that the world is a very good place. =) **thank you.**
i'm a double hard bastard, but i ain't no cunt, sir. i've loved and lost friends and family to terrible wasting diseases and i know every minute with them still remains a joy to me. if in any way i can help ease another person's discomfort so they can have more time with their family, it's always worth the time, consideration and investment, however small. you can't buy back lost opportunities but if you can afford someone more of them, why not?
this is patrick, kevin's brother. thank you *so, so* much. don't sell yourself short. i don't even know what to say man. kevin's year has been more than made by this.
this is blowing up way bigger than i thought! thank you for all of your kind words reddit!
you should introduce yourself, because according to the livestream his dad "doesn't know who the fuck lukas stalker is"
you're a great guy, really inspiring and i'm really happy you got to see his ecstatic reaction live.
on it, fed this to some tech reporters at about 10k. saw thread momentum, the medias gonna get it. at end of the day, stories like this make us remember how fortunate many of us are today. if only we could replicate this at scale across society.
did you ever get the dog? is the gofundme page up?
he can keep the money i'll take care of the van or get him a new van.
i need to get in contact i'll get the motor swapped.
thanks friendo! he pm'd we'll start working on the details, i'll get it done!
people are wanting to fix the van for free let him know! /u/tritonv8guy also someone wanted to send him a package of handheld games. scour the thread. good luck!
thanks man. i really do hope people will keep donating!
that was amazing! my wife and i were in tears at the dinner table. :)
there is. looks at the description. there's a gofund me link. i don't believe they take anything, and if they do, it's no where near as much as google.
no we ended up taking it down after a couple of weeks of no donations
here to help. i hope it all works out well for your whole family and congratulations on getting as much support as you are getting. thanks a lot for letting us be a part in this. god bless you guys. greetings from germany!
i chucked in $10 myself, wish i could give more but yeah, i'll be damned if it ain't beautiful to see people rallying around a good cause. thanks to you too for making a difference in someone's world.
yeah i second that. your donation is what started this snowball rolling downhill because of his reaction. have a great night man.
i just watched the live video from earlier. it brought tears to my eyes and inspired me to donate as well. good on you man. and sweet tactical vest you have in that youtube vid. lol
if you ever put it back up, pm me and i'll send 50 your way. i'm sure some other helpful redditors would do the same.
thank you so much. it's crazy how much global support reddit has garnered for our family. vielen dank aus den usa :)
the smaller donations are just as important. it's little amounts that can make a difference! i'm new to reddit, and i'm loving it!!!
what's amazing is that your post says it was posted "just now", and when i looked it's gone up to $13,805.
$26,350. when reddit is a force for good, they really really like to shoot the moon...
that's very kind of you, thank you! i definitely will post it on here and pm you if we decide to set up another gofundme.
100% serious. as long as you're not secretly wade boggs or andre the giant then i've got you covered.
i donated! i hope the money helps with any future emergency! also tell him he better get that switch that he wanted:p
i'm not crying, you're crying. naw... i'm kinda crying. this is wholesome to the max.
he's almost at 17k now. hopefully they will be able to put a good down payment on a newer van and not have to worry about this again for a while.
more, like peewee herman, i'd cost, you,close to about $3.50
he edited his comment that kevin's brother reached our for him.
unfortunately he is probably on disability, and as such can't afford payments + insurance on that even with a healthy down payment. plus wheelchair accessible vans are ridiculously expensive even for a no frills basic model. the only way they could probably afford operating costs + insurance would be if we can muster up enough donations for them to buy it outright. and frankly, why should we stop there? how about we all push this far enough so he can get a new chair, a brand new van so he won't have to worry about that ever again, and enough for a bit larger place to live with wheelchair access and enough extra to pad their savings account for future rainy days?
that horse has to be thinking, why is this girl trying to round house me?
"if she can't get on, i can't throw her off when i mistake a hose for a snake. let me help."
lpt: be around a horse while you're barefoot, that way you can tell which of your toes got ripped off instead of smashed if you had worn boots.
this whole situation just really irritates me until the horse bends down. "okay, dumbass. hop on."
she trained the horse to lay down, the horse didn't do this by itself.
"here. would you please stop kicking my ass and get on already!"
by the way, she's practicing "fly mounting," which is considerably harder than even just getting into saddled horse. most people have to fail at it for a while before they can do it gracefully, or at all. a good horse is usually fairly patient for this as its strength and size allow them to take a lot of impact before it really hurts or bothers them.
i can't get my head around someone who enters a horse corral bare foot. that's disgusting and dangerous. the one fool who tried to ride our horse bareback got his pelvis crushed.
this thread is weirdly aggressive... no shit she isn't actually trying to get on, they're filming to show the horse help her get on
if a person that fit can't get up their there is no way i'll ever do it. that's good information to have.
was she doing it on purpose to show this "feature" or not? it looked like she didn't jump at all.
reddit: what can you say during sex that can also be said during equestrianism?
my horse broke a(nother) halter yesterday because the hose was obviously about to eat him. it's not like i've been giving him baths at least once a year for the past 13 years or anything.
being a horse must be exhausting. everything and everyone is probably a murder in their mind.
thank you, thank you for making me aware of something i literally never thought about until now. added to the checklist of shit not to do around horses.
i got my toes stepped on by a horse one time. i can guarantee if i hadn't been wearing sturdy shoes it would have been a lot worse. pretty sure she broke a toe, but there's nothing a doctor can do for that, so i didn't bother going to a hospital to find out.
i didn't even finish watching. only a complete idiot would be barefoot around a horse so i decided i didn't care what happened to her.
it's like she's not even trying. like...just jump a little bit. just swinging your leg over obviously isn't working so put a little more hop into it with your left leg. she looked like somebody throwing themselves at a hooked wall while wearing a velcro suit....except the wall isn't hooked and there is no suit.
it looks like an actor to me, the camera work is pretty decent too, certainly not some random filming of a woman trying to mount a horse just for fun.
i imagine, judging by the physique and apparent skill to maintain balance without a saddle once she was seated, that this was part of the horses, training to realize the rider was having difficulty.
judging by how very in shape she seemed, yeah i'm thinking she was just faking so that the horse would get the hint and help out.
some horses are very helpful though. i grew up with on my mom called "the sitter" because he was super gentle and helpful with kids and beginners. he'd use his neck to to nudge you on, and he would not trot or canter until you were actually ready. i remember a friend riding him who was super unbalanced. he didn't trot for a solid 30 minutes until my friend got used to being on a horse. then when he did start to run and my friend slipped to one side the horse would stop, spread his legs out and wiggle his back as needed to "catch" the rider. i miss that horse, that was my mom's first baby. she had him longer than she's had me, and i'm 20 now.
just want to say that i grew up horseback riding and can confirm that fly mounting is incredibly difficult.
yeah between the bare feet, skimpy clothes, and wooden equipment strewn about, it all adds up to poor conditions to have a horse around. but mr. ed does look well trained and kept though, so agree with all the others that this is staged.
my thoughts exactly. anyone who can ride bareback like that has done it before, not to mention that horses don't kneel like that unless their trained. plus, fuck, learn to jump.
the above is the source video, for anyone wondering why this person posted a seeming random youtube link with no explanation.
i dunno wtf is wrong with her, im like 3x her weight and i can pull myself on one, she had zero spring to her jump and was just pivoting
20 years of horse ownership here. i am rolling my eyes so hard at the comments in this post. yes the girl is just an idiot. no she is not faking being unable to get on. the horse just wants to roll and isn't trained to "help".
til most virgins' first attempt at sex is performed standing up
i remember my first time, she was riding on top and i was holding her waist and i was lost in the moment and didn't realise i was elbowing her in the top of her thighs. she politely pushed them off but i still kinda cringe thinking about it haha
they really are. im fascinated by my dogs every day.
it's been trained to do this. the beginning of the gif is just for show.
my horse is actually a very small dog but she doesn't like hoses that pretend to be snakes either.
a light breeze moved a branch and my sister's horse threw her, then bit her thigh. she was in a really bad way, couldn't walk for a few weeks after. horses are such beautiful creatures and so much fun, but they're also fucking crazy.
i think i remember something that horses basically think they're dying or going to die constantly, is that true?
a bath once a year? i know nothing about horses, is there a reason why you would bathe them but do it so infrequently?
tigers. there are tigers everywhere. there are tree tigers. rock tigers. wind tigers. grass tigers. hose tigers. sometimes other horses turn into tigers for a short while. and all of these tigers... they're the horse eating kinds of tigers.
i assumed that she's a stunt actress, or at least a napolean dynamite type, and is practicing skills that are meant to look badass. if she'd actually succeeded first time in flinging herself up there and galloping-off bareback into the sunset, we'd all be pretty impressed. but no-one can do that sort of thing without a lot of practice.
pretty sure she wasnt trying on purpose to get the horse to do this on camera.
to be fair i've seen this exact scenario play out so many times, and it had nothing to do about catching something neat on camera and everything to do with the fact they can't bloody jump onto a horse's back. even if they're fit and have good balance, they might have the bounce of a rock. although if it is to show the horse being trained to lie down to let a rider get on, that's really cool.
it's harder to mount a horse than it looks. if you're not used to it there's also a sense of unpredictability since it's a living thing.
she is actually pretending to not be able to vault, if she turned her head left and looked down she would be able to get her legs over. it sounds counterintuitive but it works. she can definitely vault onto that horse but is pretending she can't so that she can show off how she trained her horse to lay down. i have no idea how to teach that one, it's very impressive.
had sex for the first time at 16 (long time ago unfortunately). 16 yo me saw porn with people banging against the wall, thought i'd try it. threw my back out. back still hurts today.
can confirm as a virgin who recently had his first attempt
please don't disrespect her. she's an equestrian girl
yeah, my dog just ate a turd while staring directly at me blank faced. i mean, what was she trying to tell me there? if she was trying to gross me out, it worked.
please refrain from mounting your horse if you haven't been doing so already.
aspiring horse trainer here. did it really bite her directly after throwing her? because if so that is hard to explain. horse may be an asshole?
why're constantly looking for ways to die i swear to god. they will colic and die if their oats have clumps
generally horses manage quite well with infrequent baths. the more they are worked however, the more frequent they need to bath. even then, it is often no more than a spray down to remove the sweat and detritus from a stringent session. but honestly, you will usually be asking yourself why you bother about five minutes later. most of the horses i've worked with take particular pleasure in immediately going and rolling in dirt and mud the second you've finished. also, most horses i've known have absolutely adored the sand pit... so goodbye nice shiny freshly washed coat.
if they are a descendant from something like zebras, and you change tiger to lion, that explains quite a few things.
you should totally check out the stuff you should know podcast on hook worms. you are one lucky human. ever hear of dew-itch?
i grew up with horses and always thought is was cool how in the movies the cowboys would run along side the horse and jump on. so i decided to figure it out. it took a long time to get the horse to take off running without being on it already and then just as long to figure out how to time the jump and actually get on and that was with a saddle to help pull myself up with. but once i finally did it it was an amazing feeling for sure! i wish i had video of it but that was 20 years ago and the vhs camcorder was a bit much to carry around...
are you a horse person? if so i believe you, but if not; perhaps you've seen people try jumping onto a saddled horsey; but mounting a horse with no saddle is pretty damn difficult, especially a biiiiiiig horsey.
ah, yes, i knew there was something sleeping inside my body that didn't need rousing
dated an equine studies major before. i wouldn't recommend it.
i can vomit through my eyes by clogging my nose and mouth, thus forcing the vomit up through my tear ducts. my goal is to be able to do this on command while maintaining eye contact and thus establish dominance. i bet your dog doesn't feel as gross any more. you're welcome :d
i find it hard to believe. a spooked horse is going to bolt. not stick around to take a chomp of the person. i'd suggest that sister is embellishing.
colic! that's what it is called! don't they get goats, so the horses feel dumb for being afraid of stuff? because the goat will be like, "yo, chill out man. everything is fine."
so doesn't the stomach acid like burn your eyes? also how does one discover the ability to do this?
but why tf would you want to? my sinuses are over connected so every time i throw up it comes out my nose and gets stuck in the cavities around my eyes and it burns like you wouldn't believe.
this was my thought. i had two horses and have been thrown off a few times. after getting thrown the horse is either running around the arena and you have a fun time catching him, or he runs a little bit then stops to stare at you on the ground like "why are you down there now". i can't imagine a scenario where a horse would throw someone and then somehow bite the leg.
wash horse, set him lose within clean carpeted house. problem solved.
in my experience most horses are just really big, jittery dogs with hooves
you haven't noticed how most of the cute gifs get comments about how the animal in question is about to see the "you died" message?
how does that hold up proportionally? we humans have huge dicks relative to other primates because our women preferred mating with men who had monster dongs (4in+)
by the age of 16, you had wrestled for 17 years?
you focus your energy at around the back of your neck but one palm width lower. then you yell angrily and there, you're now a super saiyan.
i want a 22lb house horse. him and i can kick it on my shag carpet, i could set up a mini carousel in the basement for him to do laps on and he'll be there for me when i cry because my last friend who had no shot of getting married just did and now i'm sitting here wondering how i got this old alone i was supposed to be one of the first, but my horse will be there to comfort me and tell me about my redeeming qualities like how i can hold my liquor really well or sometimes i don't always embarrass myself when meeting people and we'll be bros.
damn, man, better not come near me with that 4" monster deeck!
no, i wrestled from 4 to 21. sorry for the confusion.
reminds me of a girl who told me to not call her boots cowboy boots, but equestrian riding shoes.
oh whoops, oooh. i dropped...monster condom that i use for my...magnum dong!
yes that exists...reddit...from aww to horsedicks in one click
wow, was that organized wrestling at age 4? or roughhousing with dad?
you made it sound like you were forty and your back hurt from your first sexual encounter, not twenty-four and a back plagued with injury from wrestling... and i also thought you were fighting for the wwe until i realized you were talking about peewee wrestling to college.
because i didn't notice the pattern until the 3rd horse girl. then the one thing they all had in common clicked. fucking horses.
i'm surprised wikipedia isn't on board. there's still time i suppose.
how many of these sites are going to go black on the 12th? it's sounding like they are just going to put a message on their front page or something.
why aren't google, apple, and microsoft joining the initiative?
classic quote - "no one in the porn industry ever yells 'slower, slower, slower,'" he said. "we're much more accustomed to 'faster, faster, faster.' here at pornhub, we want to keep it that way."
if all these go black, july 12th will be the most productive day ever
idea: can we collectively recruit cpgrey, kurzgesagt and vsauce team to work on an explainer video that we all display on our websites that day?
all that really needs to happen is for google to threaten comcast that they'll block all comcast ips from using their site and this overturning net neutrality crap will all go away. (it would never happen, google would lose too much money. but imagine if they did it...)
it would be nice to know exactly what is happening on this day. everything is quite vague and there are no "details" other than a date.
hey porn sites.. wanna help? ban congressional ips. them fucks will quickly learn wtf net neutrality means.
you know who's missing here? netflix. shady assholes don't care now that they're an established player.
it is really poor form to require people to enter their name and email address to participate in something purporting to fight for internet freedom. past endeavors like the sopa campaign had a wonderful site that 1) stated exactly what participants would be doing and why and 2) openly provided the graphics/code/etc for websites to use. none of it required providing personal information. visiting this new site accomplishes none of those things.
please correct me if i'm wrong about this, but isn't the net neutrality battle currently specific to the us? i'm canadian, and would like to do everything i can to help, but am unsure what i can do from outside the us. does anyone know if an equivalent law is already in progress here in canada? if not, i'm sure we would be one of the first counties to follow suit after the us killed net neutrality, so i'd like to help. how can i do this?
seems brandi maxx is back to being politically active again.
even pornhub is calling out ajit pai/comcast on their shit...
it would be so awesome if google and facebook joined. i don't get why they don't do that ...
i'd be fine with pornhub going all black for a day
i'm the administrator to several wordpress websites, is there a plugin i can activate on that day or a redirect to another site i can do? we don't get a lot of unique visitors, but all the sites are involved in the entertainment industry so if i can raise awareness to our clients, then hopefully that'll spark something.
i'm sure a few banner or welcome ads will change things. /s grow a set and shut it all down for a day. that's how you change things. in reality, the same greed that's pushing net neutrality, it's the same greed that will stop these huge sites from actually doing something impactful.
sorry if this is a stupid question, but i'm still a little confused as to what is going to happen on july 12th. will the websites that have signed up be going offline for the day, or just making their visitors aware of net neutrality?
holy shit pornhub gets 75 mil daily visitors , how does the site not crumble under demand especially without cloudflare...omg the underlying infrastructure+network setup must be amazing.
they need the donations to afford all the paint needed for the black out.
they're fiercely apolitical, and that's probably a good thing.
just doing the same thing we've done in the past doesn't seem like very much fun, does it? :-) we're still working on the details -- and leaving lots of room for input from the internet and for sites to get creative -- but the basic idea is that sites will display something really prominent that shows the different ways that losing net neutrality would break the internet (ie slow loading, censorship, extra fees, etc.) sopa was a blackout because it was about censorship -- net neutrality is broader, so we have more room to get creative.
my question exactly. what are they going to do? if it's not go black then it's inconsequential in my book.
they should force people to pay $1 for access to the website. "oh you don't like that? it's ok, we don't either but if net neutrality goes away you might pay more for access to websites. find your representative and give them a call." the money goes to the eff or another foundation. half a day of that would piss off enough casual users.
google could end this shit in a day if they really wanted to. can you imagine if google search, gmail, youtube were all shut down for an entire day and just replaced by a paragraph on net neutrality? they would never do that of course, but fuck if that wouldn't get literally everyone's attention.
gutting net neutrality benefits them. they can afford to pay whatever fee the isps want, and any other competition that can't pay dies.
iirc apple has made their position clear. but they won't be partaking in the bfn day.
you really want net neutrality to get out there? ...... have every one of these sites agree to shut down for just 3 hours, with a message about net nuetrality and links for next steps. 3 hours without social media, porn or shopping will make worldwide news for weeks and shake up the country like never before.........as sad as that is. edit : thank you for the gold!! edit 2 : i love goooooooold. (thanks again!)
nope, stackoverflow and github are shutting down too.
maybe not vsause, we want to stay on a central topic not 20 different ones about tech and the internet in general.
destin from smarter every day might be worth contacting too (/u/mrpennywhistle ping?), he's done videos in the past about how content stealers on facebook affect yt content creators, and this is a tad bit more serious.
yessssss. we desperately need more good videos to help break down and explain this super important but complex issue
comcast has captive customers, from long contracts and lack of broadband competition. when they get in a dispute with a content provider, and traffic is harmed or blocked altogether, it hurts both sides. but comcast can hold out longer, because their customers largely aren't going anywhere.
or google could just rollout more google fiber. pls
we're going to be announcing a lot more details soon. we wanted to make it an open process where we can get lots of feedback from internet users, online communities, and websites that will be participating. see my comment above for some more examples of the types of stuff sites might do :-)
i think netflixes statement is the saddest part about this. they basicly said "we want to fight this, but it would be futile and it won't hurt us as much anymore". the futile part is what gets me, since netflix has been so strongly in favor of nn for years now.
looks like a good ol fashioned boycott may be in order.
oddly enough it could actually affect the internet outside of the us. say for example a small american startup hosts their new video site themselves and have to serve through comcast yet refuse to pay comcast's extra fees for priority bandwidth. well, if you try to use their site it's going to run slower because the source is being restricted. it's one example but a real one.
honestly i think google has a good reason to not shut down for any amount of time. people literally rely on google for everything, and i wouldn't be surprised if google shutting down did more harm than good. facebook and netflix are showing their colors by not shutting down, i can buy that. but i can understand google remaining up.
in my country mobile providers already have social media data packs (unlimited fb/twitter/instagram/youtube etc. for cheap) now you know why.
i'm all for this. having pornhub load slowly wouldn't work on me. they merely adopted the slow internet. i was born in it, molded by it.
are you going to shut down your business for the day?
unrelated, but so ~~does~~ *did* t-mobile with their binge-on plan. you can stream all the video/music you want and it doesn't count against your data cap. basically they are treating certain types of data different than other types, which is 100% against net neutrality in my book. but a while ago, there was a thread full of people arguing that it wasn't against nn because it favored the consumer.
this is what i don't understand. there are some popular violations of net neutrality. it's not all about comcast throttling netflix. isn't t-mobile's plan that offers free data to netflix and other streaming services a similar violation of nn? now, i'm obviously not suggesting we toss out nn so we can have wikizero and t-mobile unlimited streaming plans. but it seems like it's not really being enforced when it's "good" or popular practices.
what about the sites intentionally slowing down page loads to take like 10 or 15 seconds while displaying the banner and saying "this is the internet without net neutrality. welcome to the slow lane. you can prevent this by..." since this is about that particular issue. i'm sure some great web engineers can make it so that only happen the first time someone visits a site that day!
also the most important thing is the phone calls, emails, and in-person meetings with lawmakers that all of this traffic generates. that's what wins the fight in the end, not just the symbolism
if these sites want to make a point, they need to suck it up and shut down for the day. letting people continue to access what they want by simply clicking past something isn't going to work. people need to be inconvenienced and uncomfortable.
i don't agree. google's banner on the sopa protest day probably did more for awareness than any other company, for example. same as wikipedia's quick black wall that was easily circumnavigated.
i imagine they're reluctant to remind people how much of their online life is controlled by google
google is practically a public utility by this point. people have come to rely on google for advice on damn near everything, including safety issues, childcare questions, or whether or not something is safe to eat. if you took google offline people would literally die.
amazon is pretty big though. i'm surprised they joined.
netflix is probably already paying the isps, even under current net-neutrality rules to avoid the link-problems they had before.
3 hours would not be enough. 24 or 96 hours could be beneficial, people would loose their minds at not being able to access any content. that could definitely get people to open their eyes and see what's at stake here.
too much lost income for participating companies for something like that to ever happen i would assume.
this is genius. 3 hours without porn would probably trigger 70-80% of legislators and 95% of congressional aides. shit, if twitter went dark for 3 hours can you imagine what cheeto would do?
if you want real pandemonium, get amazon to slow/stop aws.
so july 12th will be the day my coworkers discover that i'm a fraud with no real knowledge.
they need to really focus on the water and electricity analogies. even people without internet knowledge understand that. you pay for your electricity and you can use whatever you want in your house whenever you want. the electricity company doesn't care if you're using it to power a computer, microwave, light bulb, refrigerator, etc. just like the water authority doesn't care if the water in your house is being used by the sink, toilet, shower, or hose.
still though, how mad would those customers be if when they typed in www.google.com, they got a page with the message "looks like you're using comcast to access the internet, google cannot be reached from your walled garden."
so is it a site will do whatever they want on this day, or are all the sites talking about what they should all do collectively? i hope those details are released soon, because so far it feels really unplanned and vague.
if these sites do anything less than shut down for 24 hours it won't have any impact and nobody will care. just my two cents.
i'm going to drop my netflix on july 12 who's with me?
it would definitely affect me, some game servers are in washington state so my already sub-par connection will turn to crap.
binge-on is dead now. t-mobile one has unlimited data for everything with hd streaming too.
couldn't that risk the adverse effect of people being pissed off at the protestors? like protestors standing in the middle of a freeway?
this is a really great idea, even if the sites (understandably) do not shut down business. i think it would be an attention-grabbing way for them to communicate what's at stake rather than just "another wordy pop-up". i wonder what their plans are.
i think 3 days without social media would do the planet a lot of good honestly
i can't imagine they'd like a world in which they're at the mercy of isp corporations though, so consider it an investment.
3 hours for 1 country should be survivable. especially for world wide sites like amazon or pornhub.
they might lose more in the long run if this goes through
3 hours without porn *at night*, not just 12 noon when everyone is at work.
i'm pretty sure no coder can function without those two things.
that only works if it meant comcast would lose customers. they wouldn't because they have nowhere to go.
comcast will just come up with their own search engine that redirects from google. they'd probably prefer this honestly.
t-mobile one "optimizes" video by default to 420p. you need to upgrade your plan to get hd video and you need to turn it on every 24hr if you want it.
i think the main reason why a blockade by aws would be more effecitve by amazon, compared to google, is that the normal user doesn't know about aws. if you go to google.com or youtube.com you know you're using a google service. but when you use literally any other website it takes time to find out whether that site uses amazon for *something*. if there was a way to show the average user how much they depend on any cloud service, the vast majority would call for anti-trust regulation like people did in the 1930'ies. because that is really what it is about: a mega-corp silently providing access to much of the stuff people use every day
there are people literally hosting life and death critical stuff on aws though (which they shouldn't)
yea, this wouldn't be good for my work. if i miss a critical email requiring an emergency response or i'm not able to email information stored on the google drive account, it could mean mean a host of things that could put someone's life at risk or leave them stranded half way around the world after a disaster.
the ceo said it's not a big issue for him now that he's on top.
their stance is kind of like "we're big and beloved now. eh."
they used to care but the ceo has recently said that nn is no longer as far up on their list of priorities. i mean honestly, i don't know what people are expecting at this point.
putting the "without net neutrality" message at the bottom and in tiny text really loses the message that you are trying to get across...
"i never knew how much i valued this until someone told me its value."
you (and a lot of other people in this thread) forget all the positive social media does, including organizing environmental cleanups and social-political movements. grass roots activism literally doesn't exist without social media at this point. don't throw out the baby with the bath water.
exactly. they'd probably lose a fuck ton more in the long run if net neutrality dies
i'd prefer if they did it world-wide, actually. as an european many of the services i use are american, and i really don't want isp's killing off services i use because said services didn't bribe the isps.
what is up with the word "coder", it sounds so /r/itsaunixsystem, why not just say programmer?
not every comcast customer is devoid of a competitor. i'm sure they'd still lose enough customers that they'd take action.
he's saying they're no longer expanding. it was costing google far too much to fight the lobbyists trying to keep them out of the areas they wanted to expand to, so they were forced to abandon expansion of the project. they are now focusing more on investing in wireless infrastructure to hopefully one day provide internet over the air rather than having to fight to get their lines in the ground.
more specifically i think they said that they are big enough to negotiate the deals they want. which is; 1. awful, because it's the same thinking that goes on with isps. 2. laughable, because all the major isps also have streaming video services, and they'd just as happily ditch netflix to funnel more users onto their own services.
that's ignorant. comcast is gong to leech them dry.
right now everyone still loves netflix. but when cable is gone they will keep getting more like the cable companies.
it's also a question of pride. nobody wants to pay off isps like they're the fucking mafia.
actually, amazon is one of the few that actually stands to gain a lot. given its size it has a lot more bargain power that say, imgur or etsy.
the only thing which is needed to ensure net neutrality survives is privacy protections on internet traffic. if internet service providers can't inspect packets without violating privacy laws, then they can't implement price discrimination. if they can't engage in price discrimination, then they can't engage in rent-seeking beyond the existing system of territorial monopolies. this can be accomplished by encouraging people to contact their local representative and senators for their *state* legislature (not congress), and asking them to pass internet privacy protections that prevent price discrimination passed on what sites you are communicating with, and to lift any restrictions on municipally owned fiber in the state. laws which prevent municipalities from owning their own fiber in the same manner that they own roads and pipes are usually passed at the state level, so dealing with state legislatures is also an important part of ending the current system of territorial monopolies.
yeah but i don't want government telling me that if i became a multinational billion dollar corporation that i couldn't make draconian deals with local municipalities and form regional monopolies.
right?? like they know a lot of companies throttle because of netflix already right??? y'all are big enough to sit at the negotiation table and pick out which strap on they're gonna ram you with.
netflix: "we'll be fine! we're big enough to negotia- why does our site redirect to hulu?"
step 1: offer service step 2: charge competing services so much operating on your network is cost prohibitive step 3: redirect your customers to your service step 4: profit step 5: spend some profit on congress to undo/loosen more regulations step 6: ??? step 7: profit even more
netflix is quite full of shit. they want the world to think they're sitting pretty comfortably, but i'm one to believe that they don't have the money to support the movement. they selfishly cut outside content from their library and instead pump more money into their "originals" and they don't have the money to spare. a while back i thought i read that they were in debt because of how much money they are budgeting toward their own content and they still planned on increasing that budget. of course, i may just be salty that they are cutting most of futurama. excuse me, i have a subscription to cancel.
he said he can afford it, not that it should or shouldn't be.
if you're going to do that without also boycotting hulu (jointly owned by comcast and disney, and a few other anti-nn companies) and every other service that works against net neutrality behind the scenes, you're kind of shooting yourself in the face. otherwise the only lesson companies will learn is "don't get politically involved with issues important to internet mobs, because they might turn on you later"
shareholders don't have pride. that's who a lot of these companies answer to. it's why do many of our companies make morally shit decisions all the time. they answer to shareholders that want the stock price to go up. i work for a fortune 200 company that is constantly finding ways to outsource, cut wages, and decrease benefits despite already being massively profitable. my wife works for a privately held company that pays well, fantastic benefits, flexible work life balance, and generally doesn't destroy the souls of the people working there.
but that means it still has to bargain and spend extra money buying off each provider. then continue buying them off... while the isp has nothing to lose by saying "fuck you amazon, pay me even more."
how the hell would that save you money? i mean i know it wouldn't, but how did they try to explain it?
several people in this thread have said 'cpgrey' instead of 'cgp grey', i wonder how much of this traffic comes from people googling the former.
the thing that scares me is it can't keep going on like this forever. something's gotta give eventually and when it does it'll be bad.
the context makes it worse to me quite honestly. they are willing to fight for it when it benefits them, and then they are going to stop when they get to the top? sounds like they were supporting net neutrality for all the wrong reasons.
yea i read the statement as "i've got to keep the business focused on it's own survival, and we don't have the time or manpower for the nn fight". not that i agree with that decision either, but it's at least a decision i can understand.
agreed. this is a solid point. i don't plan on switching to hulu i never bought into their business plan anyway. i felt really betrayed when they offered a free service/ad supported for so long then just basically totally shifted and walled everything up behind a pay wall.
the same way they did it for tv, make everything package-based and pretend they can give you better prices if they don't have to give you access to everything. "why would you pay for all these websites you never visit? instead of having to charge you ridiculous prices of over a hundred dollars a month because of terrible infrastructure costs and evil government regulations, save money by paying only 60 dollars a month to access the websites you really want to access! plus, since these are your favourite sites, we'll give you premium high speed access to these! none of our competitors have it! we understand that you might still want to get on other websites, so as a favor we'll still give you 10 gb of general bandwidth for free and a trial of our premium unlimited high speed access to netflix! our competitors usually charge 20 dollars a month for this, but we're giving it to you for the first month for free!"
that something is the economy, and likely the government immediately after. these corporations are already doing everything they can to focus as much money possible in the hands of as few people as possible; eventually the gradient will become so extreme people forfeit the dollar and... i'm not quite sure. some people will make themselves useful and barter, but others have no skills outside of a company. but when the dollar falls, so too will the politicians who covet it.
sounds like publicly traded companies are amoral entities beholden to the financial interest of their shareholders and not ethical business practices.
paid for their service and then had to watch an ad before watching a movie trailer...which is an ad.
jokes on you. i'm so fast i shared it on facebook before it was even created by me to take credit for me stealing it. from myself. and i don't even have facebook!
some crackhead probably robbed a relative's coin collection. crackheads are really good about putting old coins and bills back into circulation.
i've recently found a small jar of these under a loose floorboard in my closet. i don't even know where to begin to take them to get looked at.
historical, i know nothing about antique coin value. it has to be worth something to someone.
pm me if you want to sell it for 9 bucks, via pay pal
most nazi currency is nearly worthless for some reason. not sure why, surely it's rare and part of an incredibly interesting part of humanity's past.
numismatist (coin collector) here. what op has here is a $2 piece of the 3rd reich. it is roughly 80% pure silver and the production of these was put to a halt around 1939 when the price of silver skyrocketed and it became more expensive to produce these than what they were actually worth. i recently saw one of these sell for $4,500 at auction and it was in much worse condition than this. my advice would be to take this to an appraiser immediately. he will be able to give you much more information besides the hot steamy pile of bull shit you just read.
i'd probably get it appraised and put in a case, just so it doesn't seem like you have some random nazi memorabilia just rolling around in your junk drawer. that could bring up some awkward conversations.
worked as a gas station cashier for a stint after college, this is so true. i have a decent collection of silver coins because of these people.
and suddenly the small cool coin collection ive made from working with pokies makes a lot of sense
i collected almost 50 dollars worth of bicentennial quarters as a hobby when i was a kid. also had an old two dollar bill with red ink and a 1921 silver dollar. all gone. now i just a bunch of foriegn coins i've collected. surprised they didn't take those too.
from my experience though it's not a coin they generally keep out unless you ask.
what would be an example if a coin that is highly sought after and worth a ton?
it was actually pretty brutal how slowly he moved that coin.
fun fact. the coin, a 5 reichsmark, which is given to erik in the film is shown as having a 1934 date, when in fact the coin was actually first minted in 1936.
yup, it's not really worth much it seems... bout 25ish bucks.
he should sell it to a history museum for a high price!
it doesn't look like any euro coin. people would notice that. switzerland might work if the size matches some coin, they have so many silver coins.
coin shop. if they have a moral objection, try another coin shop. if you have a moral objection, a jeweler or metallurgist can reclaim the silver.
i've got a friend who's an expert nazi, let me call him up
heil do anything, he doesn't care. i don't even know what's goering on anymore.
maybe put it behind some glass, on a pedestal. maybe dedicate a room to it with other nazi related historical finds. you could get some flags and put them up around the walls. you wouldn't want people going through your junk drawer to get the wrong idea.
i'm in college and i count all of the money for my movie theater each shift. i couldn't believe it when i found a 1935 $5 bill in perfect condition. my dad told me that's how he built his collection, from when he used to work a job in college counting money at an amusement park.
pokies are slots in case any non-aussies are confused.
i get the feeling there's a very real, very detailed story behind this comment
i was in munich a few weeks ago and walked by a coin shop. they did have a few nazi-era coins in the window but each one had the swastika covered by a small piece of paper. i wasn't sure if it was due to legal regulations or not but i thought that it was a bit silly since everyone knows exactly what symbol is underneath and what it looks like.
1928 us mint peace dollar ($1 standard coin of the era) in excellent condition. coins are graded on scale of 0-70. anywhere in the ms(mint state) range, that is 60-69 would be worth more than my home.
especially considering he knew his friend was inside his mind.
it's silver content is higher which makes it heavy
is there something wrong with earth's gravity in the future, marty?
i dont know much about it, let me bring in an expert. expert : this coin. is worth atleast $2500 rick : i can go $100, i mean its gonna sit on my shelf, i got bills, thats all i can go. seller: i think i got a good deal, i walked out with more than i was asking.
unless i'm not getting your sarcasm, i think the point is that spending that in germany would be frowned upon.
also, if not, try a large auction house. they sell thse things a lot, as war memoribila. people buy nazi flags, plates, glasses, beer stiens, not because they are racist ( at least not most of them) but because its interesting.
your edit is the correct meaning. look over to the right, and the columns for ms60 and ms63 are referring to mint state coins.
need you to gestapo that reich now. nazi puns are the wurst.
don't crackheads realize how much more crack they could get if they just sold these old coins for close to what they were worth?
the problem is that the act of publicly displaying nazi symbols in a shop window might not be considered as art or political education but rather as a declaration of political affiliation which is highly illegal in germany. it totally depends whether or not swastikas are illegal and probably the shop owner just wanted to avoid any kind of trouble.
we all know exactly what is hidden under a black rectangle if a naked person is shown in the news, yet there is this very rectangle. all censorship is silly.
plot twist: iamemperor86 lives in a 1994 ford aerostar, down by the river.
dude i wonder how much that mentally affected proffesor x
i thought it would have been the weight of 6 million jewish deaths, then i remembered how malnourished they were, and realised that would be a bad comparison.
a lot of people say back to the future vii was ill-conceived, but i think the way they had marty play guitar in the tiergarten as the red army bore down on hitler's bunker was inspired.
not very useful if your max investment is limited to one us quarter, but still cool.
[cut to slack-jawed chumlee dropping it in the pinball machine in the corner]
can't you get arrested for heiling hitler in germany? how would spending this coin go over?
i am an atheist, but i have a catholic german bible printed in 1810. it's in terrible condition, and has a gothic style typeface that makes it near impossible to read, but it's interesting as fuck to me.
he was a huge fan of wolfenstein, he even has a wolfenstein flag and went to wolfenstein conventions!
haha yeah. i was going to say 13mm for a mint nazi coin is excessive.
how much is a coin worth. that link didn't say anything on value
i hope it'll be another thousand years before i hear that joke again.
as a former drug user i can tell you that when i was desperate enough to steal from relatives or friends or whoever, i certainly wasn't going to wait a week to sell something on ebay.
if they're using crack in the first place my guess is that they don't have much logic
really? who the fuck sees an antique coin in an antique coin shop and thinks hmmm this one coin in specific says a lot about this person's political affiliation. the nazis are making a comeback. i guess by that logic i'm a roman legionnaire.
i was trying to come up with an argument to contradict your point, but then i realised that i have nothing. there is no logical argument, but it just *feels* natural to me to censor genitalia and not swastika. kinda makes you think.
pcgs, one of the biggest coin grading services, puts an ms60 1928 peace dollar at a price of $475, so you're actually really close. i can find an ms64+ on ebay with a buy it now price of $2000.
honestly, im no english teacher but i dont know if metaphor is technically the right word (might be though) what he is pointing out, nonetheless, is that is that the coin physically felt heavy, but also has a heavy emotional background - as i understand it.
just get the $25 in quarters and do it all over. keep repeating until you're set for life.
is chumlee his actual given name? who would do that? chumlee sounds like the last scoops out of an expired can of spam.
i was just in germany and people were doing the heil hitler at a beer garden, it was a joke for some dudes birthday, but staff did not like it.
it's illegal to display a swastika in any public place, so it would be a pretty terrible idea to spend it.
hah. oh man i laughed harder than i should have at that.
no one in their reich mind would pay that much for a coin.
no. it'll probably only be good for about 12.5 years.
this is the correct answer. no drug addict is going to wait any amount of time other than right now for drug money. if it's between $100 next week or $20 right now, i'd bet my heroin stash the junkie chooses the latter. that's how confident i am.
congratulations on being a former drug user. a lot of people don't realize how hard it is to get to the "former" part. good on you!
naw, smart people do stupid shit all the time. especially drugs. it's more relevant that using that 5 gets you high *right now*; selling it means you have to come down.
my guess is that they are heavily depressed or have some other untreated mental illness and are using drugs as self treatment, because it's one of the only things in life that make them feel alright, and society and individuals should not ostracize them because of it. sorry, i mean, haha retarded junkie
that was the greatest payoff that i have seen in a movie in quite a while. almost literally his first and last lines of dialogue are in regards to his sensitive nipples.
but 50 reichsmarks is 1/10000000000000 of a shekel
you know, it's hard to *not* find jews in israel.
it's not a valid currency anyways. there's nowhere on earth where you could use it to pay for anything unless you melt it down and sell the silver, assuming it's made of silver. not really an expert on nazi coins.
i can't wait for my investment portfolio to mature. so then i can smoke some crack.
and the sheer terror and panic of dying a grusome death knowing you are powerless to stop it.
he might've been selling it instead of using it. but apparently big hoss was hooked on meth for awhile and used cheeseburgers to get off of it which is why he was so big when the show started. maybe chumlee did the same thing.
you really cant throw a rock without hitting one it seems.
wouldn't it have more value as an historical item?
you're doing it wrong. get some crack as part of he portfolio. diversification through investing in commodities. or consumer staples depending on your level of need
the great irony is that when a man has accumulated enough crack, he is too old to truly enjoy it.
it's less than a week's worth. doesn't matter how big it is.
hey fellow opiate username! how's life in heroin land? terrible as always?
its for the 14 words "we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
1488 is a neo nazi slogan. the 14 stands for a popular white suppremecist ideal consisting of 14 words: "we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children" while the 88 means hh for heil hitler, as h is the 8th letter of the alphabet.
i have a similar coin. wanna trade? auschwitz with you.
it's less than planned. it's always less than planned...
no one in the history of crack has ever woken up in the morning with more crack
my birthdate is 1/4/88. i should probably stop shaving my head
first time i've ever heard of this, and i plan on promptly forgetting. seems like one of those useless trivia type things.
i honestly did nazi that pun coming. did jew guys?
"there, there, it's ok, everything is fine. i'm here for you." *goes in for kiss* "i'm so sorry. that was too soon."
when i was a kid my cat would always come to comfort me whenever i cried. i miss that cat.
i'm not a cat guy, but i ended up with a russian blue (like this one) and it was incredibly affectionate. i've heard that it's common in the breed. we went through a lot together. he gave me 10 good years and curled up next to me one night and didn't wake up. i'll be mixing his ashes with mine one day.
my cat did this the morning i was having to put him down (he had terminal cancer and was in his last days). i was holding him that morning, and i was sobbing my eyes out. he reached up, wiped my tears, and licked them off his paw over and over. then he nuzzled me under my chin. i couldn't stop apologizing to him. i can't even type this without crying more-cats are beautiful, beautiful animals.
cat: *"where was that jugular again? this thing is making a lot of noise."*
how do animals detect upset-ness? or is it just anthropomorphism?
my cat growing up when ever i was getting yelled at by my father. she would show up sit in my lap and stare him down. with this defiance like "try yelling at me bitch!"
my cats lose there shit when my one year old cries, they lick him run against him and usually meow angrily at me, judgmental bastards
this reminds me of my own cat, he somehow knew when i was down and would always try to cheer me up. when i was a teenager, i used to sneak out of my house often to hang out with my friends, go to the 24 hr diner, pretty normal shit like that. during warm months my cat would often sleep outside, and he'd see me sneak out, but then usually went back to sleep when i left and came back. one night, i was feeling pretty damn bad (my dad and i got into a huge fight, it was the last straw for me) and i wanted to commit suicide, by walking to a tall bridge near my home and leaping off. my cat followed me and meowed all the way to the bridge, as if to stay "stop!! don't do it!!" i sat on the ground near the beginning of the bridge and my cat crawled up to me and did something similar to this cat in the gif. my cat saved my life. man, i really love cats, they're the best companion imo
pets are amazing. they are loyal and caring in a way most of us aren't. when i see moments like these, i am so happy we have pets.
my cat does something similar whenever i'm sick. cats are sweet, if they're not then maybe you're doing something to make it hate you. cats aren't like dogs, you could beat a dog every day and it would still love you unconditionally, a cat won't. cats have to be treated well to like you.
this just goes to show that cats can be just as nice as (if not better than) most dogs. i can't stand the anti-feline bigotry coming from these so-called "dog people" on reddit.
one time i was having a panic attack in the middle of the living floor. this was about 13 years ago and i can't remember exactly what got to me so bad as to go down in full tantrum style screaming and crying, wishing for death. our little tabby comes in from the bedroom and sees me face down on the rug, crying my eyes out. we were the only two in the house and she came up to me and began brushing her face on the side of my head. the purring calmed me, but the act of love that i recieved from a pet instead of a human made me cry more. only this time i wasn't hysterical just softly weeping. i remember now: i was 18 and living alone, far away from my parents in a different city where i knew no one and i just felt stupidly alone. stupid, because i left my family to "find myself". all i found was drugs and date rape. it was a hard time, skittles (my kitty) was my only ray of light. i moved back home soon after.
" hey i know you are sad, but im really hungry. can this not be about you for a second and you just feed me?"
more like, "this defect prey is almost small enough for me to kill and eat... ".
same here. most of my cat's life was hiding under beds, but if someone was upset he'd always come find you and comfort you. weird yet awesome.
i used to have a cat that would settle down on the affected area and start purring if i were feeling sick or was hurt. i always thought of it as him trying to heal me in his own way. i miss that cat.
my cat is a bad cat. he scratches and bites everyone. when i was really depressed and at my worst he didn't leave my side. always sitting with me, cuddling, letting me pet him endlessly, and he didn't bite or scratch during that time. once my spirits lifted though...
did anyone come home or did you and the cat have to raise each other?
i grew up with a cat who i got only a few years before some rough years dealing with illness at a pretty young age. my sweet cat stayed with me whenever i was too sick to get up, and tried to make me feel better with antics and silly behavior when i broke down and cried from it being too much sometimes. every time i was sad or upset, there she was. i think that because one usually has to earn a cat's love and trust, (vs. dogs who are generally just big love-floofs toward everyone,) people tend to think cats arent just as wonderful. i think cats are wonderful. i also think dogs are wonderful. they're just different. and that cat was my sweet, caring, and constant companion during the toughest part of my childhood - i miss her every day.
the cat almost certainly knew you were upset and scared and was trying to comfort you. despite what some people on the internet think, cats can be incredibly empathetic and are genuinely caring of their family, and understand very well when someone is upset, or scared, or sick, and will often do their best to try to comfort and soothe them.
i was perfectly healthly for the past 12 months but last week i was so ill i had to be bedridden for two days. throughout my illness, my cat who was often grumpy to me suddenly became affectionate and stayed on the side of my bed purring and hugging my arm. then one day i woke up feeling great, almost as if i was cured overnight. my cat, again, became indifferent and gave no fucks about me. yeah i love-hate you too, olaf.
the first part of your story also happened to me. i came out of my room to find no one in my family at home but all their cars were there. i was pretty young and we lived out in the country. i ran around the house and outside yelling for them. when i couldn't find anyone i got scared thinking they were all raptured to heaven and i was left behind so i cried and took a nap. when i woke up they were all back and had no idea what i was talking about.
mine is so vocal too. it makes direct eye contact and tends to be really sociable and attention seeking
absolutely. russian blues are the dogs of the cat kingdom. very loyal, play fetch, eat anything, have a very distinctive yowling conversational meow and are cuddling purr machines. follows my kids around and have to be present and part of every family activity. took a seat at the table for a backyard bday party with 25 screaming kids running around. that's devotion.
i have a blue, and he's, like, too affectionate. but when i was going through a particularly bad period of grad school he'd always snuggle up to me at night. as i get better he backed off, like he knew i was ok, his job was done, and he could go back to midnight wrestling matches with his smaller, 3-legged orange tabby brother.
you're not a cat guy but you've owned and loved a cat for ten years and then you're going to be mixing its ashes with yours after your dead? your sense of chronology is disturbed.
i'm so sorry having to lose your little guy. i know it's cliche, but he isn't in pain anymore, but i know it still hurts. stay strong
the same way we understand how animals are generally feeling. they learn to understand the sounds we make, our expressions and behavior, and for those pets with sensitive noses, can also smell chemical changes and the like.
one of mine came matter-of-factly mewing at my bedroom door last week when my two-year woke up crying in the middle of the night. i guess i wasn't moving fast enough for her high, cat standards.
my cousin brought over her baby to my house once. the baby for whatever reason started crying hysterically and my maine coon had to come check out the situation. then his hair stood on up like he had a mohawk all down his back and wouldn't let anyone near the baby. i eventually had to pick up my cat and got scratch and bite like no other then threw him in a room. it was the first time he encountered a baby and probably didn't know what was going on. i've never seen him get like that but i think he had good intentions.
***wub wub wub*** i don't know why but that's my life-force-stealing noise i play in my head.
why is she crying? and why is someone filming her crying? i get it people, i didn't read the description. i just opened the video on res
there have been so many moments in my life where i am truly sick of having to deal with humans. pets don't give a shit about whether you're getting good grades or what kind of clothes you wear, they just love you.
i'll quote that one chick again i guess: why are dog lovers so hateful? like you meet a cat lover and they're like "oh i love dogs a lot too! i just prefer cats!" but dog lovers are always like "my entire family was murdered by a cat, a cat stole my girlfriend, burned my house down, took my job and keyed up my car!
people with "asshole cats" just didnt raise them right, or dont know how to properly take care of them. ive had cats all my life and they are the sweetest little creatures.
they already are. there are a few hundred variations on "the cat isn't *actually* sweet, it just wants (food, to murder the kid, etc..)" in this thread already....
have you seen those tidy cats commercials? "toss me that litter"? who the hell throws a huge bag of cat litter? better yet, who asks for someone to throw a huge bag of cat litter at them? i guess someone that needs to mask the scent of their kitty's shit.
before i click on this, will someone else click on this and tell me whether or not it's going to ruin a perfectly nice, if slightly overcast sunday afternoon?
holy shit is this guy for real, his content is vomit inducing
my cat is similar except she likes people, and instead of hiding all of the time she will just lay down in the middle of the walk way during the day, not at night though, she learned the hard way sleepy people can't see her at night.
my mom came home eventually :p but i did raise him as my little cuddlebug :3
my floof recently died who, like yours, only had a few years with her sickness. it's so tough, the sweetest, most caring cats are the ones who die young. my family doesn't quite understand why i'm still so torn up about it. we had such a close bond.
depends on the cat. my current (and last) ones don't give a shit about me but my sweet perfect kitty who passed away years ago was very attuned to me. one time my spouse jumped out and scared me as a joke and i screamed, and my cat came running and attacked him to defend me. he was a good kitty. the best kitty.
yup. my dearly beloved kitty purdy used to not really enjoy being picked up or cuddled, just her personality and hip pain. but, one day i came home from high school and was having a really rough day and i laid on the floor and bawled my eyes out. she came up to me and sniffed my face and just sat next to me and comforted me with her presence. rip little purdy.
what do i do if my cat is broken though? like, he knows when i'm upset, but rather than comforting me, he walks over, licks me a few times, then bites me. it's like he's sampling if i'm ready for consumption yet.
when i caught a cold, my cat was like "your sneeze scared me, bro!" and ran somewhere else.
i've heard cat purrs are at a frequency that promotes healing. don't know if it's true, but i choose to believe.
pretty sure mine started to speak english to me. when i was opening the front door he'd meow too hurry up. i swear! and he would hug me so tight and slobber on my neck. best cat ever!
i was never sure whether my cat was a russian blue or just a regular gray cat, but then you basically described my cat. down to the yowling and rather annoying meows.
also that girl probably texted the cat's cell phone with a frowny-face emoticon.

kids cry all the time over anything and sometimes nothing
hey, it isn't the cat's fault that their crap is smelly. it's usually what they are feeding them.
people hating on cats in a positive cat thread. reddit in a nutshell.
taco backwards is o cat. sorry, that's not that impressive.
depends on the breed in my experience, my american shorthairs are assholes but my korat, same breed as the gif, is an utter sweetheart.
it's actually an affectionate thing. cats bite - gently, for the most part. they do forget we don't have fur so sometimes they do it harder than is comfortable for our skin.
one of my cats meows every single time someone sneezes. always this short little meow that she doesn't use for anything else. i can never tell if she's scolding me for scaring her or saying "bless you" because she's hears us say something every time someone sneezes. either way, it's adorable. she's a super empathetic kitty.
confirmed. i'm a father at my 7 years olds birthday party right now. 12 kids at a bowling alley. each are taking a turn crying over fucking something. you guys got pizza, free video games and bowling. life. is. good.
wait i just thought of a thing. could you use a cat as a mobile desalinator to keep yourself alive on an remote island with only salt water around? i mean you'd probably need at least 10 cats to get enough water for your day, and you'd need probably definitely want to purify it... but in a pinch... bear grylls it.
it's not a spoiler if everyone already knows it was going to happen. cats are going to kill all of us eventually. their bloodlust can never be quenched.
op, you can't leave us with this unfinished tale..
really? my american short hair was the sweetest cat i've ever met. my siberian on the other hand... not so much.
my korat is a mixed bag. she will let you hold her like a baby, she gives kisses, hoards laps, but if you try to move she will do that growl thing korats do.
i think we worked because we were lucky to ha e each other. i moved away to start my first job shortly after he was born. i lived in a tiny house in the middle of a pasture, next door to a country bar. even as a tiny kitten, he took the job of guard cat very seriously, alerting me to drunks staring in my windows, killing and delivering scorpions to me (eek!), and sitting with me to watch tv in the evenings, belly hanging out, the remote between us, and a bowl of cookies and cream before us both. i do miss those days, but i was so fortunate to have his companionship.
mine is afraid of black people. not because he is racist, but he can't read their facial expressions. he is also scared of people with sunglasses because of that.
if you're talking about drinking cat urine, then no. iirc the reasons cats can drink salt water is because their kidneys are so efficient they can expel all the salt. so cat urine is far less potable than human urine. if you're talking about blood, that's probably more disgusting but might be achievable, herders from certain tribes do something similar with cattle.
only when they sit atop a throne made of billions of human skulls, only when they can gaze upon an endless river of blood and history, only when their ears are soothed with the cries of the slaughtered, only when the skies are blacked by the smoke of mankind's cremation, only when our species is encased in the cold stone of the eternal tomb, only then will they be satisfied.
reading through the breed characteristics, i see a lot of words under "personality" that seem to be attempting to not call them assholes. i've met some nicer american shorthairs but not many and very few i would describe as affectionate without evidence of heavy crossbreeding.
"you make it the same way you make orange juice. you just use cats instead." -alf
woah what did i miss? i came for uplifting cat-ery, started scrolling, and now we're drinking cat piss.-.
when i was young i had an alf doll. it spoke, but i was not aware of that fact until one night i was home alone and something scared me, so i was hiding under a blanket holding onto him. i finally squeezed whichever part activated the voice and suddenly hear, "i'm hungry. do you have a cat?" it pushed my nerves completely over the edge and i basically went cataconic until my mother got home.
