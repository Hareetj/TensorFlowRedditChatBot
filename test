that guy's pronunciation is pretty awful for someone who's supposed to be knowledeable. like he keeps pronouncing kshatriya as ka-sha instead of ksha. such an egregious mistake, just kind of grating to hear.
what of poles that we can't observe or verify? i believe there are only so many poles we can identify and use, but everything else requires the one capability unique to humans, belief. imho, suspending belief and only assenting to verifiable knowledge will only hinder humanity.
